0:29the Barry, a lot.
S Speaker 10:31Got it, got it. And then what's, what's the plan like? Last day I was speaking, I think the team was still in Taiwan. And then you are planning a US expansion? Will you, will you like, will the team move to us? How are you thinking about it?
Got it, got it. And then what's, what's the plan like? Last day I was speaking, I think the team was still in Taiwan. And then you are planning a US expansion? Will you, will you like, will the team move to us? How are you thinking about it?

S Speaker 20:44Yeah, we're moving to the US after our next round, after this round of fundraising, yeah, because, because most of the market and most of the revenue will come from the US, right? So we're not only moving to the US, we're also going to establish our headquarters there. And we are currently in the face of restructuring our company. So currently it's like us being owned by Taiwan, being owned by this Taiwan entity, right? Yeah, we'll do a company flip. So that comes, for example, yeah,
Yeah, we're moving to the US after our next round, after this round of fundraising, yeah, because, because most of the market and most of the revenue will come from the US, right?

S Speaker 21:41It's been great. I think we're having such progress that we decided to make our fundraising round earlier than expected. We're not We're not that short in cash. It's just that we want to scale into the next phase, right? So the reason why, why we came up with that conclusion was because we have these great takeaways from semiconductor fabs, which we have been working with the SMC for the last year, right? Yeah, and then after that, we thought that started to introduce us to, for example, SK Hynix, Samsung, and obvious was a micron so we can we realize that, hey, we might be able to scale outside of TSMC, but that will require us to build, like, robust products on top of, on top of what we had with TSMC. And I think that's quite interesting in a way that it is obviously challenging, right? Apps are never easy, but, but, yeah, I think we had, we have some preliminary results, and that we begin, we believe that we can scale now. That's one part. And the other part is that we also focus. We also focused on warehouse, right but we're also going into semi into data centers right now, because after Jensen, Jensen Wong called out, called us out on what we did with TSMC. It was basically there's this thing which is a piping agent, a piping generation agent within within semiconductor fabric that accelerates the piping design process. And actually, it was envied internal employees who saw that, and they contacted us and said, Hey, if you're capable of generating this piping in a bag, then why can you not generate piping and cablings in a data center? Because in data centers this that is like another painful thing, absolutely. Yeah, everyone draws them by hand, right? So we began kind of like a collab, kind of like a proof of concept collaboration, with Nvidia, and what we validated was that everything that we built for TSMC, for semiconductor fab, actually works exactly as as it should be in a data center scenario. It's just that we will need to fine tune the rules like, like, change how these change. Like, what is the coolant system? What? Is a coolant, coolant type that goes into data centers, right? So I think that is validated. And Avida is currently inviting us to start collaborate, start our collaborations with, for example, Jacobs, these major EPCs that builds the discipline that builds the data center facilities. So, yeah, so I think we're having a lot of a lot of really interesting stuff going on that that allows us to start to think about this possibility of starting our

It's not an easy task, not an easy industry that you're working in. Yeah. Really, it's challenging. Yeah. So Daniel, that's that's super interesting, and glad we could connect right in the time of fundraising. Maybe, if we can take a step back, can you talk me through what say? What are the products that are live today, and what looks like in the product roadmap, and then, then, sort of with the products that are live, what are the customers today and how does the pipeline look like?

S Speaker 25:26So, as priyeshin mentioned, we we started with,
So, as priyeshin mentioned, we we started with,
So, as priyeshin mentioned, we we started with,
So, as priyeshin mentioned, we we started with,
5:32sorry, yeah, totally Yeah.
sorry, yeah, totally Yeah.
sorry, yeah, totally Yeah.
sorry, yeah, totally Yeah.
S Speaker 25:35We started. We started from warehousing industries, right? And the reason why we started from warehouses is because it kind, it kind of like is a, it's a, it's an earlier version of a day. It's an earlier version of of a precise manufacturing site, right? It has all automated solutions. It has all these, all these potential for physical AI to be adopted, right? And from met AI perspective, we build digital twins because we want to make it as a simulation infrastructure for physical AI training. So we will need to, firstly, lower the barriers for people to adopt to train physical AI within digital twins. Secondly, we will need them to be to be hooked up or to be connected with different AI solutions to make it work. So for the lower barrier part, we are releasing this first product of ours, I think, later this month, which is called met Gen four warehouse. And although the first, the first the beta version is, is mostly for our early access users, such as those huge, large warehouses in the US and some partners of ours in Taiwan. Yeah, I can give you a brief overview of what it does. So this is the application that we built, and it's a beta version. So please endure the UI. We haven't, like,

S Speaker 17:02optimize that totally, totally, yeah.
optimize that totally, totally, yeah.
optimize that totally, totally, yeah.
optimize that totally, totally, yeah.
S Speaker 27:06But what we did is that one of our technology modes or our pipelines is that we are our model understands what is happening in the CAD file and in a blueprint. So as you see, like, sorry, as you see, this is, this is the exact CAD file AutoCAD blueprint that we are inputting, importing into this. This, this application that looks like this. And after you, after this user imports this file, what is does is that this metric for warehouse, at least for every single component within these environments, such as, What is a conveyor belt? Where is this? Where is this turntable, and so on, so forth. And then within, within one minute, I think it's, I think, for this thing is around 20 seconds, we actually generated this whole like calm, this whole warehouse with complexity that also has all these like angles, all these different assets that is simulation ready within these environments, so with all the structure itself as well. So what this does is that, okay, the angle, the angle that we're trying to penetrate the market with, is that we can simply generate these environments as an infrastructure level application, where you can simply generate your your whole facility within several minutes, as long as you have a blueprint, yeah, and then that is quite easy for for that's quite straightforward, right? So with the blueprint, you can start situations of what is scenarios? Yeah, right. So there's that, and we'll be releasing that later this month. However, the reason why we are obviously this still needs to be optimized, but the reason why we are fundraising is not necessarily for this application, because I think, I think for Metro programs, we're quite, quite, I think we're quite, we are quite, how do you say that? I think we understand the roadmap quite, quite quiet. Yeah, right now, yes, I got it, yeah. However, when we go to semiconductors, then it becomes really complex, because, because every fad possibly will be different, then what we will need to do is that we will need to understand what is happening in the fact, I think that requires manpower, right? So I'm not sure if they've ever showed you this, but what we did with TSMC was this, obviously we cannot show like, like, super, super propriety in for info from TSMC, yeah, but that was called out by Jensen, so I can, I can provide public info, which is this fab of TSMC. We okay to begin with. We never built them one fact. What we built for them is a platform that generates each and every fact. So if you, if we're talking about Arizona fact, then generate the Arizona fact. What Taiwan fact and Taiwan fact, right? So what, what this necessarily does is that, to support the SMCs global expansion plan, we can have them ready with every single fact that they can go, go, go within and train their AI solutions in that environment. So that that requires several characteristics of the these values, which is, first of all, it has no inaccuracy at all. If it is, if this pillar is 30 times 30, then it is 30 times 30 as as what I showed in the warehouse scenario, like, if the conveyor belt is 30 meters in length, then it should be 30 meters in length. Yeah. And then after that, we do three things at once. The first thing is that we train an AI layout engine that basically is an agentic AI workflow that comes into this digital twin and starts to put in equipment so that, so that it chases for some of the rewards, such as, such as the best the best capacity usage, such as, you should squeeze as much equipment into these environments as possible. So what this agent AI does is that it is so capable of communicating with this digital twin because it's all made by us, right? So they TSMC provides us with a list of tools that they intend to put inside this fab graphic tool and squeeze in, graphic tool and squeeze in and that these are also incorporated with all the all the rules and design, design requirements of tnmc. And then after the layout, we do the second thing, which is the piping. And so the piping, it's so painful, right? So we generate all the pipes, such as playing like the Nokia game snake within the environment. And with all these, with both of those bundled together, we kind of shortened the design phase of a fab by around one one to 1.2 years into 48 hours. And I think that is quite astonishing, because we might be able to accelerate the fab expansion processes so much. That's the two things that I mentioned. But the third thing is even more interesting, which is TSMC actually told us that the environments that we generated is capable of doing physical AI training, which in a sense that they have already trained more than 10 different types of robotic systems within our digital twins so that they can do like robotic dog surveillances, robotic dog monitoring and so on and so forth. So I think from the three things that I mentioned, I think we have, we have successfully validated that this is kind of an infrastructure level of technology, and we are able to, we are able to empower industrial and physical AI training within this simulation environment.
But what we did is that one of our technology modes or our pipelines is that we are our model understands what is happening in the CAD file and in a blueprint. So as you see, like, sorry, as you see, this is, this is the exact CAD file AutoCAD blueprint that we are inputting, importing into this. This, this application that looks like this.

And then within, within one minute, I think it's, I think, for this thing is around 20 seconds, we actually generated this whole like calm, this whole warehouse with complexity that also has all these like angles, all these different assets that is simulation ready within these environments, so with all the structure itself as well. So what this does is that, okay, the angle, the angle that we're trying to penetrate the market with, is that we can simply generate these environments as an infrastructure level application, where you can simply generate your your whole facility within several minutes, as long as you have a blueprint, yeah, and then that is quite easy for for that's quite straightforward, right? So with the blueprint, you can start situations of what is scenarios? Yeah, right. So there's that, and we'll be releasing that later this month. However, the reason why we are obviously this still needs to be optimized, but the reason why we are fundraising is not necessarily for this application, because I think, I think for Metro programs, we're quite, quite, I think we're quite, we are quite, how do you say that? I think we understand the roadmap quite, quite quiet. Yeah, right now, yes, I got it, yeah. However, when we go to semiconductors, then it becomes really complex, because, because every fad possibly will be different, then what we will need to do is that we will need to understand what is happening in the fact, I think that requires manpower, right? So I'm not sure if they've ever showed you this, but what we did with TSMC was this, obviously we cannot show like, like, super, super propriety in for info from TSMC, yeah, but that was called out by Jensen, so I can, I can provide public info, which is this fab of TSMC. We okay to begin with. We never built them one fact. What we built for them is a platform that generates each and every fact. So if you, if we're talking about Arizona fact, then generate the Arizona fact. What Taiwan fact and Taiwan fact, right? So what, what this necessarily does is that, to support the SMCs global expansion plan, we can have them ready with every single fact that they can go, go, go within and train their AI solutions in that environment. So that that requires several characteristics of the these values, which is, first of all, it has no inaccuracy at all. If it is, if this pillar is 30 times 30, then it is 30 times 30 as as what I showed in the warehouse scenario, like, if the conveyor belt is 30 meters in length, then it should be 30 meters in length. Yeah. And then after that, we do three things at once. The first thing is that we train an AI layout engine that basically is an agentic AI workflow that comes into this digital twin and starts to put in equipment so that, so that it chases for some of the rewards, such as, such as the best the best capacity usage, such as, you should squeeze as much equipment into these environments as possible. So what this agent AI does is that it is so capable of communicating with this digital twin because it's all made by us, right? So they TSMC provides us with a list of tools that they intend to put inside this fab graphic tool and squeeze in, graphic tool and squeeze in and that these are also incorporated with all the all the rules and design, design requirements of tnmc. And then after the layout, we do the second thing, which is the piping. And so the piping, it's so painful, right? So we generate all the pipes, such as playing like the Nokia game snake within the environment. And with all these, with both of those bundled together, we kind of shortened the design phase of a fab by around one one to 1.2 years into 48 hours. And I think that is quite astonishing, because we might be able to accelerate the fab expansion processes so much. That's the two things that I mentioned. But the third thing is even more interesting, which is TSMC actually told us that the environments that we generated is capable of doing physical AI training, which in a sense that they have already trained more than 10 different types of robotic systems within our digital twins so that they can do like robotic dog surveillances, robotic dog monitoring and so on and so forth. So I think from the three things that I mentioned, I think we have, we have successfully validated that this is kind of an infrastructure level of technology, and we are able to, we are able to empower industrial and physical AI training within this simulation environment.
But what we did is that one of our technology modes or our pipelines is that we are our model understands what is happening in the CAD file and in a blueprint. So as you see, like, sorry, as you see, this is, this is the exact CAD file AutoCAD blueprint that we are inputting, importing into this. This, this application that looks like this. And after you, after this user imports this file, what is does is that this metric for warehouse, at least for every single component within these environments, such as, What is a conveyor belt? Where is this? Where is this turntable, and so on, so forth.

S Speaker 112:50That's that's very incredible, Daniel, and for sure. So how does the partnership, or maybe, like a question before that, you mentioned simulating in the entire fab, then simulating piping and simulating, say, all the equipments that will go inside, and then eventually, sort of putting that all together to support TMC, tmsc, global expansion. How is the partnership today? What? What parts of the entire solution do they plan to use, and things like that. So would love to understand that better, yeah.
That's that's very incredible, Daniel, and for sure.

S Speaker 213:29So, so the partnership is, yeah, we're obviously not, not invested by TSMC, right? So not in that sense, but we what are they using on there? They intend to use it on every single fab that is going to be built right now, afterwards, after now, and also like I'm not sure if Qualcomm faces similar problems, but there's this thing in TSMC, which is re layout. So when they want to, when they want to switch a fab from a five nanometer production line into a two nanometer line, for example, they would need to, like, take out some of although this is an existing fab, they would need to, like, take out, bring out, like, 200 equipments out of the 1000 and then squeeze, squeeze in Another 200 right? So this our our workflow is also capable of doing that. So they are actually redesigning, like their, their their movements, in order to leverage our platform to do that type of relayance. So yeah, this is their intention. Is quite, quite big. So which is also why I mentioned that we are not focusing on one fab. We're trying to build them an infrastructure that supports their global
So, so the partnership is, yeah, we're obviously not, not invested by TSMC, right? So not in that sense, but we what are they using on there?

S Speaker 214:55they are on the verge of using that so, so we are in, we are wrapping up our collaboration for this, for for the first phase, the first phase is the ones that includes the item that I mentioned previously. There's a second phase. And for that, after we wrap up this, this first phase, they will start using it in three pilot, pilot facts, which I probably should not, should not mention we wish, wish three, but one of them is in Taiwan, one of them in Arizona. And, yeah, another one is an advanced, advanced packaging bag, also in Taiwan, yeah.
they are on the verge of using that so, so we are in, we are wrapping up our collaboration for this, for for the first phase, the first phase is the ones that includes the item that I mentioned previously.

S Speaker 115:34And so for some of these upcoming projects, Daniel, do you have say and POC today? Do you have an LOI? Do you have a signed contract? How does this
And so for some of these upcoming projects, Daniel, do you have say and POC today? Do you have an LOI? Do you have a signed contract? How does this

S Speaker 215:44it's not a POC, it's a paid it's a paid agreement with 3.5 million in revenue.
it's not a POC, it's a paid it's a paid agreement with 3.5 million in revenue.
it's not a POC, it's a paid it's a paid agreement with 3.5 million in revenue.
it's not a POC, it's a paid it's a paid agreement with 3.5 million in revenue.
S Speaker 115:50Got it. Got it. So. Daniel, how does the revenue look today? And are these? Say, more recurring revenues? Are these more Arr, kind of revenues? Are these more service based NRE kind of dollars,
Got it. Got it. So. Daniel, how does the revenue look today? And are these? Say, more recurring revenues? Are these more Arr, kind of revenues? Are these more service based NRE kind of dollars,
Got it. Got it. So. Daniel, how does the revenue look today? And are these? Say, more recurring revenues? Are these more Arr, kind of revenues? Are these more service based NRE kind of dollars,
Got it. Got it. So. Daniel, how does the revenue look today? And are these? Say, more recurring revenues? Are these more Arr, kind of revenues? Are these more service based NRE kind of dollars,
S Speaker 216:06for this year we're aiming to achieve, we're aiming to have around, around four to 4.5 million US dollars in revenue, yeah, based on our agreement. And with that, TSMC, like 3.5 million comes from TSMC, the other one, other other clients of ours. However, for the 3.5 million, it currently looks like this. It's like 2.9 in NRE, but around 0.6 0.7 as an AR as a solution based model. However, this is, this is kind of like a very, you a kind of unique business model that we have, yeah, which, because we're very vertical specific, you don't do horizontal stops, right? So whenever we go into a specific vertical we always start with a co creation development process with this industry leader, at least one of the industry leaders, right? Which is also why we work with the TSMC in this semiconductor industry. Absolutely work with Nvidia in the data center, data center industry. So within this phase, it kind of is, look, we kind of are acting like an a system integrator, because we need to adopt all the domain knowledge into these models, but we're not a project based company, right? Yeah. So after we build that, it becomes kind of like a subscription based model that, without the proprietary information from TSMC, we can provide this app, this this platform, to other different fabs, such as SK Hynix, such as micron and so on so forth. So that becomes, we shift into the second part, which is it becomes an infra level. I think it's not a SAS. I think it's more of a pass. So with that pause, people can subscribe to that, and not only other fabs, but also the ones that build the fabs in the world for TSMC, yeah. So that scales, right? And not only that, we can also allow users to subscribe to our workflow, our agent, again, workflows such as TSMC subscribing to our layer optimization tool, right? So these are the ones that they can subscribe to. So it kind of like it's an infra Plus application business model that our users can decide what to subscribe however, one last thing is that we, we currently don't, don't regard us, or don't regard ourselves as an AI application startup. We regard ourselves as an AI infrastructure startup. Yeah, so our objective is actually that we don't really want to train these we actually want to enable our customers to train those but why are we doing that now? Because we need to convince our users that our infra works. Yeah, that I need to train the first, first several apps on top of our infrastructure. 100%
for this year we're aiming to achieve, we're aiming to have around, around four to 4.5 million US dollars in revenue, yeah, based on our agreement. And with that, TSMC, like 3.5 million comes from TSMC, the other one, other other clients of ours. However, for the 3.5 million, it currently looks like this.

S Speaker 118:52100% yes, Agree. Agree to that. Daniel, super interesting. Daniel, so I understand the semiconductor fab piece well, and you mentioned that you're starting with warehousing. So how does truck traction there look like? Who are the customers there? What are the use cases for some of them?
100% yes, Agree. Agree to that. Daniel, super interesting. Daniel, so I understand the semiconductor fab piece well, and you mentioned that you're starting with warehousing. So how does truck traction there look like? Who are the customers there? What are the use cases for some of them?

S Speaker 122:30Super interesting. Daniel, yes, as I agree to everything you have said, and let's just tackle quickly the last part of the solution, which is data centers. That's also very strategically interesting for Qualcomm as well. How are the solutions being developed there, and where are you in the entire development roadmap? Yeah.
Super interesting. Daniel, yes, as I agree to everything you have said, and let's just tackle quickly the last part of the solution, which is data centers.

S Speaker 222:53okay, so I mentioned that in the in the data center scenario, we are, we're starting with pipings, right piping and cablings. So what we are currently building is this. This is like an earlier version, but I for for the more complex version I probably cannot show. So think about that video provided us with this, this blueprint again, so that we generate the racks, we generate what goes where, and then with that, we generate the pipes based on the design files that NVIDIA provided to us. So as you see, our algorithm understands that where we should add these components and how these pipes go into these outlets and inlets. And there's this validation that you can see afterwards, which is, you think that probably is an animation, right? However, if I move this pod around these environments, it still generates a complete set of pipes so that you can, you can shorten the design time to market. So, so, so enormously, because all the pipes will no longer need to, need to be drawn by hand, even if you move this pod so far away from all these other pods, it generates that with all the components needed so that, so that this, this can become kind of like us, like, like when you construct this, you just follow, follow the follow this lead of this algorithm.

Interesting, interesting. Daniel, and this
Interesting, interesting. Daniel, and this
Interesting, interesting. Daniel, and this
S Speaker 224:21is, this is like a very simple version, right? And we're starting to go into, like, cooling systems. So, so it's horizontal, it's not vertical, right? But that will, that will enable us to work, to work directly with these EPCs, instead of working with Nvidia. So the business model of that is also quite interesting, which is we're all we actually starting to discuss with a video on if we could charge her GB 300 or in the future, probably GB 400 or such, because we firstly optimize the wiring, the cablings within this set of racks, and then go into the facility. So we charge these EPCs per facility. So that becomes like a, like a, like a dwell purpose business model.

S Speaker 125:10Yeah, and Daniel for say, designing cabling. I understand from a manufacturing and Fab construction perspective, you can have a recurring business model in terms of you can train different robotic assemblies. You can use them for changing assemblies. How do you see a recurring business model for the data centerpiece,

S Speaker 227:19I think, I think, I think at the end of the year will be just that. Okay, we wouldn't have more because we're trying to productize right now, trying to gather more

customers. Yeah, got it. And how does the, how does it look for the next year?
customers. Yeah, got it. And how does the, how does it look for the next year?
customers. Yeah, got it. And how does the, how does it look for the next year?
S Speaker 227:35Okay for the next year, we're okay for for the next year, we're aiming to achieve around five to 8 million US dollars. And the reason for that is because we do have huge interest from all these semiconductor fads, but that will be kind of like another, another project that leverages our platform, right? So the main objective next year is that we Okay. Currently, it's like, it looks like this. It's like format AI, it's like NRE and AR, right? And for next year, we want to shift it to around 5050, yeah. So, so if that's the case, then what we'll focus on is the productization of data centers and semi technical facts and warehouses will continue

to test the market. Yeah?
S Speaker 128:41It's typically, it's typically say there is friction from the legal team every time we go back and ask for an NDA. But let me do this. Can you send me the deck and let me come back to you with a set of questions on my end, I will also like to set up a follow up call, including one member of my team who is particularly very experienced in data centers and robotics.

S Speaker 229:30Okay, okay, sure, I'll do that. So I'll send out the deck and Okay, regarding the live demo, I would need to see because live demo is also in the data room, actually requires an NDA, but I'll check, I'll check, and get back
Okay, okay, sure, I'll do that. So I'll send out the deck and Okay, regarding the live demo, I would need to see because live demo is also in the data room, actually requires an NDA, but I'll check, I'll check, and get back

S Speaker 129:44to you. Got it. Got it, Daniel, and from a timing perspective, Daniel, where are you in the process? I remember you, you've just started raising but when do you plan to close it, and how does the timing part of it looks
to you. Got it. Got it, Daniel, and from a timing perspective, Daniel, where are you in the process? I remember you, you've just started raising but when do you plan to close it, and how does the timing part of it looks

S Speaker 229:56for you? We just started for one and a half week, but we're getting quite some, quite a lot of interest, and we are trying to close by early November, at least not, not extending after, after mid November, because we go into, you go into Thanksgiving, right? US, US investors. So we want to close at least in mid November. So yeah, does that make sense for you? Like, like, is it too rushy for because I understand that CDC is normally more time,
for you? We just started for one and a half week, but we're getting quite some, quite a lot of interest, and we are trying to close by early November, at least not, not extending after, after mid November, because we go into, you go into Thanksgiving, right?

S Speaker 130:29right, right? The process is a little bit slower for us. It takes about, say, four to six weeks, any anytime between there to come to a conclusion. So I think it's not too it's not too hard at the moment. I think we still have, say, a month, and maybe if it comes to that, we can ask you for a second, close for a couple of weeks, something like that, but, but we will be clear on that, and I'll keep the conversation open and two fronted so that, so that you don't have to miss anything. But then just confirming you're raising a $25 million round right now. And how do you see the round, sort of, how do you see the construct of the round? Do you are you looking for more financial partners? At the moment, more strategic partners. How are you thinking to structure this
right, right? The process is a little bit slower for us. It takes about, say, four to six weeks, any anytime between there to come to a conclusion.
