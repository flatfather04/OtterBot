S Speaker 13:08Thank you. Yeah, yeah. We need to be a bit bigger. Actually, we're hiring. We're actively hiring. A lot of demand right now, so I'm spending all my time hiring.

S Speaker 15:54Yeah, maybe, I mean, I can give you context on the round that we're raising here. Yeah, I think that will inform like the timelines and things like that. So we actually decided, like, I'll just kind of bring you up to speed, like we were kind of pushed into a bit of a fundraise just as a result of kind of demand sheets on the table. And we've actually decided to do a safe round and a smaller round than what we were originally going to raise, because we're seeing faster traction with a few of our customers who are kind of bringing in revenue earlier than what we thought, right? So high level is, we're raising a $7.5 million round, okay, on a safe and looking to bring in a few strategic investors, like, that's a high level there. I think, yeah, if it's of interest, kind of let let me know. But either way, happy to tell you more about the company, and

S Speaker 26:48absolutely assume, yes, safe works for us. We have done safe investment. So that's not a blocker. In terms of 7.5 I would we will not be able to lead the round. And I think the lowest we can go is, is a $2 million check size. So just wanted to be clear on that, and other than sounds great.

S Speaker 211:23and Arsham, so I think I went through the deck, and I must say, very well put together deck, not not a long read, but touches upon the right, I would say, my points to discuss. Thanks a lot for also putting the tech stack together. That was a pretty interesting slide. What's what's interesting, Arsham, is your your own model. So the benefits that that gives you is, one on cost, I would imagine, and and second is on accuracy. Do you really think that's a big enough differentiator in this market?

S Speaker 111:56It is. It's a huge one, actually, right? And, yeah, we have the evidence for it. I'd say the best evidence we have is actually from Tesla. So they when, when they were evaluating who to use in this market, right? They looked at us. They looked at a company called alex.com They also looked at, hey, Milo. Okay, three companies, right? Hey, Milo and Alex actually just use 11 labs under the hood. And so they ran this comparison, and what they found was that if you use Hey, Milo or Alex, and you you run 1000 interviews. Of those 1000 interviews, in roughly 10% of them, you will see some kind of voice AI issue, and it's usually as a result of the text to speech. So like when, when, when I say issue, I mean, they would have screaming in the middle of the interview. The AI would laugh at the wrong time with other weird text to speech issues like that. Right now, they run the same study with us. They also run 1000 interviews, and they found that out of those 1000 only, only I think there was six issues out of 1000, right? It's like six versus 100 and so that that's real differentiator right now is, if you're a large enterprise and you want to interview a lot of people, it's almost impossible to use these other facts because they don't work at scale. And if you deploy at scale, you you hear all these issues, you get so many complaints, and then ultimately you're like, screwed, right? Yeah? So, yeah, sorry, go

S Speaker 213:25ahead, that makes sense. And I'm sure Tesla validation is is big for sure. Ashram. Why only say voice as a modality? Why? Why did you not so go for video interviews per se? Yeah.
ahead, that makes sense. And I'm sure Tesla validation is is big for sure. Ashram. Why only say voice as a modality? Why? Why did you not so go for video interviews per se? Yeah.

S Speaker 113:41Have you used any of the existing kind of video interviews?
Have you used any of the existing kind of video interviews?
Have you used any of the existing kind of video interviews?
Have you used any of the existing kind of video interviews?
S Speaker 213:44I, I am not sure. I have used mark or but I think that was voice as well. I've used Jack and Jill. That was voice as well. I haven't used any of the video ones,
I, I am not sure. I have used mark or but I think that was voice as well. I've used Jack and Jill. That was voice as well. I haven't used any of the video ones,

I, I am not sure. I have used mark or but I think that was voice as well. I've used Jack and Jill. That was voice as well. I haven't used any of the video ones,
S Speaker 113:55right, right? So, like, there's a company called tabus, if you're familiar with them, yes, yeah. So they, they, they power the video that that's used for Mark for right, as powerful, right? Yeah, if you use that video, it's, it's the best that's on the market. But if you use it, you see that it's just creepy, right? It's like, it's still not good, it it's the best, but it still sucks. Yeah? So we run our own tests. We actually have our own internal tech, and we've also used tablets. We've used everything that's on the market. And the honest truth is that none of the video tech right now is good enough to actually be useful. And so the there's this interesting problem actually comes down to which is, if you use voice, it's human, realistic enough that you effectively forget that you're speaking with an AI. Yeah, as soon as you add the AI, the as soon as you add the video component, all of a sudden, it's creepy, it's obvious. It's an AI, it's distracting, and you essentially, you lose, like, all the magic there. Yeah. And so we, we decided that. Really early on, like, until that technology is perfect, there's no point using it, yeah, because there's no, like, value add, actually, from having a video fair
right, right? So, like, there's a company called tabus, if you're familiar with them, yes, yeah. So they, they, they power the video that that's used for Mark for right, as powerful, right?

S Speaker 215:09point, fair point. From, say, just just piggybacking on this topic, Arsham, from collecting data points on a video interview. I'm not saying say the recruiter has to be video, but having collecting data points on video, do you see that adding a lot of additional points to scoring and ranking a candidate or not?

S Speaker 216:07Got it and ashram, I think the biggest question in this space, and I'm sure you, you get this asked a lot, is competition. There are companies well funded, and seems like many of them are getting momentum. How do you see sort of differentiation shaping up in the future? The ways we have discussed this internally is a lot of it has to go to GTM and how sort of plg to enterprise contract pipeline is shaping up, but in turn, but for you, how are you thinking about this?

S Speaker 116:40Yeah, I mean, there's, there's, like, two aspects to it, right? Like, we, we already have the best product, right, but that's not, that's not enough to win, right? Like, just having the best products, great, but you need more. We're the only product in this space right now that has a self serve. You can sign up. You can use it. We make money from the self serve. And we have an incredible pipeline. So, like, one of the examples is Tesla again, actually, they, they started as a self serve, interesting. Now they have, now we just hit, I think as of this week, 88 of their recruiters are using ribbon, and they have around 200 of their open roles open right now, right like, so, like, huge, huge amount of upsell, but they started off as a free user of our platform, right? And, and so it's, it's that kind of pipeline that I think will ultimately let us win, yeah, because we're not afraid for people to use the product find a lot of success, and ultimately, kind of upsell all the way to where

And, and so it's, it's that kind of pipeline that I think will ultimately let us win, yeah, because we're not afraid for people to use the product find a lot of success, and ultimately, kind of upsell all the way to where
S Speaker 217:40they are now. And how are you converting some of these self serve guys into enterprise contracts today?
they are now. And how are you converting some of these self serve guys into enterprise contracts today?
they are now. And how are you converting some of these self serve guys into enterprise contracts today?
they are now. And how are you converting some of these self serve guys into enterprise contracts today?
S Speaker 117:46We we have alerts when they hit certain usage levels, and at that point we will reach out. We actually, we usually reach out earlier as well, but at that point we like aggressively reach out and and we will upsell them.
We we have alerts when they hit certain usage levels, and at that point we will reach out. We actually, we usually reach out earlier as well, but at that point we like aggressively reach out and and we will upsell them.

S Speaker 217:59Yeah, so based on this, and based on your thresholds, how does the pipeline look like in the near future?
Yeah, so based on this, and based on your thresholds, how does the pipeline look like in the near future?
Yeah, so based on this, and based on your thresholds, how does the pipeline look like in the near future?
Yeah, so based on this, and based on your thresholds, how does the pipeline look like in the near future?

Right? Like in terms of pipeline size you mean, or in
Right? Like in terms of pipeline size you mean, or in

S Speaker 218:09terms of pipeline size and the say, self serve customers in bigger enterprise contracts that seem to be reaching those thresholds that you can aggressively sort of trust, right? Targeting them?

S Speaker 118:20Yeah, so let's tackle those one at a time, like, right, right, right now. Tesla, for example, they're paying us a little under 200k ACV. We think that by mid next year, they can be around 5 million. So we're seeing extremely aggressive expansion, like they've already asked for pricing all the way up to a million, yeah, because they they see where their recruitment is going, and they see the efficiency here. Right now, we are seeing the same thing with flexible, CNO optimize bgis Like this. Like long, long, long tail of companies. So they're all enterprises, and we see kind of similar expansions up. I think they won't all expand like, like Tesla, which is looking like it'll be 100x expansion right over the next you know, from where we were a month ago to one year from then. But that's a like all of our top 10 accounts, we think can expand by at least 2x probably up to 10x
Yeah, so let's tackle those one at a time, like, right, right, right now. Tesla, for example, they're paying us a little under 200k ACV. We think that by mid next year, they can be around 5 million. So we're seeing extremely aggressive expansion, like they've already asked for pricing all the way up to a million, yeah, because they they see where their recruitment is going, and they see the efficiency here.

But that's a like all of our top 10 accounts, we think can expand by at least 2x probably up to 10x
S Speaker 219:26and expansion here, Arsham, is it just adding more? Recruiters are increasing. Interviews are like more, mostly usage based. Do you see additional features also stacking on top?
and expansion here, Arsham, is it just adding more? Recruiters are increasing. Interviews are like more, mostly usage based. Do you see additional features also stacking on top?

and expansion here, Arsham, is it just adding more? Recruiters are increasing. Interviews are like more, mostly usage based. Do you see additional features also stacking on top?
S Speaker 119:40It's honestly both. So the I should add the way that we price is we actually price for open role, not for interview, okay? And so we were able to do that because we run our own model on our own infra, right? So like, if you do a million interviews with us, it's much less impactful to us, but if you do a million interviews with. One of our competitors, the only people who are happier are 11 labs.
It's honestly both. So the I should add the way that we price is we actually price for open role, not for interview, okay?

S Speaker 220:05And how does say your gross margin look like in that case?
And how does say your gross margin look like in that case?
And how does say your gross margin look like in that case?
And how does say your gross margin look like in that case?
S Speaker 120:09So if you work it out on like a per interview basis, right now, we have around 70% gross margin.
So if you work it out on like a per interview basis, right now, we have around 70% gross margin.
So if you work it out on like a per interview basis, right now, we have around 70% gross margin.
So if you work it out on like a per interview basis, right now, we have around 70% gross margin.
S Speaker 220:15Okay, that's pretty good. It's pretty good given. And so this kind of pricing is this also sort of shaping up as a differentiator? Do you come across some companies where pricing really eventually ends up Yeah,
Okay, that's pretty good. It's pretty good given. And so this kind of pricing is this also sort of shaping up as a differentiator? Do you come across some companies where pricing really eventually ends up Yeah,
Okay, that's pretty good. It's pretty good given. And so this kind of pricing is this also sort of shaping up as a differentiator? Do you come across some companies where pricing really eventually ends up Yeah,
Okay, that's pretty good. It's pretty good given. And so this kind of pricing is this also sort of shaping up as a differentiator? Do you come across some companies where pricing really eventually ends up Yeah,
S Speaker 120:30actually, it's a it's a massive friction point if you don't have that kind of pricing, because one of the things that we find is that companies don't know how to predict the number of interviews that they'll do, right? Because you could have one single role that's extremely popular, yeah, and have a ton of applicants now that's, that's annoying as a company you, you, you don't want to pay any more for that. And in fact, like, if you think about most jobs, the more applicants that you get, the lower value the job is, in some sense, right? Because it's, it's a high volume role, so you almost want to spend less, right? If anything, yeah. So that's a huge differentiator for us, and also one of the reasons why we're able to compete there, because for us, we actually don't care, like we we have pretty good margins regardless either way. So if you want to do a ton of interviews with less you can, if you don't, you know, you don't have to. It's not a big it's not a pain for us.
actually, it's a it's a massive friction point if you don't have that kind of pricing, because one of the things that we find is that companies don't know how to predict the number of interviews that they'll do, right?

S Speaker 221:26Basically, fair, fair. Understand that Arsham and harshim, in terms of, say, developing a tech mode over here, I understand you have your own proprietary models and the any sort of closing the loop as you scale. Does the product get better? Are you thinking in those terms, or do you really think moat would be more around?

S Speaker 121:47GTM, oh, it's buzz, for sure. It's but, but we're already seeing that product mode is getting deeper and deeper, right? Like one of the areas we already talked about, which is like the voice AI experience. But the other area we haven't really touched is that we also have a moat on the candidate analysis side of things. So we have really deep analysis on on scoring, on custom scoring for enterprises, on on cheating detection, all these things are like unique features that we have that no one else really has.

S Speaker 222:20Yeah, and how does the platform look like erm, because I also saw that you integrate into some ATS solutions already, right? So part of the workflow then gets integrated on that side. But for some users, they use EUR ribbon as an end to end solution. How does the platform on that end look like and on the other side, how does it differentiate? Right?
Yeah, and how does the platform look like erm, because I also saw that you integrate into some ATS solutions already, right? So part of the workflow then gets integrated on that side.

S Speaker 122:44So you have the choice as a team, whether you want to live like 100% within ribbon, or if you want to integrate with your ATS, and then you can live like off and half, or, honestly, whatever split you you want. We find most teams once they integrate with an ATS, they spend less time in their ATS, more time within ribbon than than one, more than they would expect, but also more than they were doing before, right? So I think that's interesting for us, because it's been an interesting point that most people just hate their ATS, right? Like, that's kind of what it comes down to. Like a lot of the companies that we're working with are using, like, workday I Sims Oracle, right? Like they do not want to spend any time in those places, and so it's a nice kind of reprieve, like they can have this thing they can integrate with their existing systems that allows them to view the same kind of data, but in a nicer, energetic interface.

S Speaker 124:27Yeah, we don't really see them as a competitor right now, to be honest, but they they've actually approached us to ask if they can use our interview tech,
Yeah, we don't really see them as a competitor right now, to be honest, but they they've actually approached us to ask if they can use our interview tech,
Yeah, we don't really see them as a competitor right now, to be honest, but they they've actually approached us to ask if they can use our interview tech,
Yeah, we don't really see them as a competitor right now, to be honest, but they they've actually approached us to ask if they can use our interview tech,

and so we're actively discussing that with them.
and so we're actively discussing that with them.
and so we're actively discussing that with them.
S Speaker 226:11100% yes, yes, totally get that on sourcing front ashram. Do you see say sourcing is upstream from interviewing. Do you see that as a part of becoming or of Riven down the line and at the same time? Currently, given you've interviewed a million

candidates, do you see,
S Speaker 226:35say, a use to develop your own sort of sourcing funnel a candidate, sync, in a sense, and use them to reroute to different interviewers. Sort of also extend vertically, expand a little bit. Add that as a feature becomes value add for some of your interviewers or or do you just want to be that in interview, in front company, in the sense,
say, a use to develop your own sort of sourcing funnel a candidate, sync, in a sense, and use them to reroute to different interviewers. Sort of also extend vertically, expand a little bit.

S Speaker 127:00no, yeah, we were expanding into sourcing like and so that's why we're extremely excited about the data set that we have now, because we have a set of data where that soon, honestly, will only be surpassed by what indeed has and what LinkedIn has right like, there are not many companies in this space that have interviewed as many people as us and or and have the rights to that data as well, right? Like, because that's another key aspect to it. And so we're pretty excited about what we can do on the sourcing side of things.
no, yeah, we were expanding into sourcing like and so that's why we're extremely excited about the data set that we have now, because we have a set of data where that soon, honestly, will only be surpassed by what indeed has and what LinkedIn has right like, there are not many companies in this space that have interviewed as many people as us and or and have the rights to that data as well, right?

S Speaker 227:32Makes sense. Really enjoyed the chart. I think, I think it's, it aligns with a lot on how we have been thinking about the space. Like I said, would love to review one the product demo and the pipeline sheet, if you have that put together. And I can come back to you by early next week. In terms of timeline, ashram, you also mentioned you have a term sheet in place. What's sort of roughly the timeline that you're looking at to close this,

S Speaker 128:00yeah, mid next week, ideally, I know that's kind of, that's, that's not a lot of time, but let me know, like, if you think that's, that's roughly doable, yeah, and I can send you exactly what you said the demo, and I'll send you a pipeline job as well
yeah, mid next week, ideally, I know that's kind of, that's, that's not a lot of time, but let me know, like, if you think that's, that's roughly doable, yeah, and I can send you exactly what you said the demo, and I'll send you a pipeline job as well

S Speaker 228:17after this call. Yeah, I'll try to come back with at least, say, a demonstration of interest or not, but it would be very difficult for us to commit by then.
