S Speaker 21:33Good, good. Priyesh, thank you. Would love to get to know you. I have the notes from the previous conversation at Sagar, but in general, would be lovely to get to know you. I can really start off with my own introduction, and then hand over to you Sure. So I've been in the Fund for another 12 years now, based on a Bangalore I've led mostly our consumer and financial services investment so many years. And today, my role is split across consumer investments. I drive some of the operating functions of the firm, including recruiting, and I also spend a little bit of time in our pre seed strategy, which is called the VC. So those are changes where I spent time before I was at the fund, I was at McKinsey for a few years, spent again, time in financial sourcing consumers back then, engineer and MBA.

S Speaker 12:30Very interesting. Thanks. Thanks a lot for that. Rajat. I happy to give you a brief background about myself as well, and let me know where you would like to double click. So I'm originally an engineer by background from IIT Madras. I did my biotechnology engineering there, and while I was with the school for about five years, I spent quite a lot of time in entrepreneurship. I did about 10 plus internships with different early stage ventures. I always wanted to be very hands on and took roles across product growth, go to market, branding, did a lot of graphic design as well. So started my journey from there, I got very interested in the entire entrepreneurial ecosystem, and wanted to be in that space, so I very proactively chose not to join a bigger corporate post my undergrad. So I got opportunity to work with clean Max, which is a B to B renewable energy company, big office in Bangalore, but they're across Thailand, Dubai and a few other places. I joined them as a business development manager. Took on a lot of early stage account management stuff. Worked with several clients, brought about. I spent about three and a half years there and brought about $17 million in AR personally closed deals worth those. These were all long term energy selling contracts, so very similar to SaaS subscriptions, if you will. And then, as I grew within the company, I also took roles across managing their wind and solar portfolios, the farm portfolios, which would account for about 45% of their entire bottom line. At the same time, started a few new business models. So the carbon credit business model for which we did a pilot with meta, now the company scaling it across different us clients did also commercialize the wind solar hybrid plant. So it was a great experience, I would say, joined the company roughly around series A and then saw the company grow from there to achieve a unicorn status during my time, which was which was great. And personally, had a lot of experience seeing the company go processes being set up, but I realized I personally enjoyed quite a lot about about my experience during IIT, where I was working with a lot of startups at the same time, not really holding myself down from an execution point of view to one idea, and that's where I wanted to pivot back. I decided venture would be a great space for me to sort of go back into that kind of an experience. And decided I'll do an MBA to pivot back into that kind of a role. So decided I'll do an MBA in the US. Went to UCLA for my MBA. Kind of followed the same playbook as I did at IIT during UCLA Rajat. I worked with six different funds during my two years of full time MBA. These were funds based in LA and SF and New York. Started out with a very small fund called Water Tower, in their advisory arm, doing research for the fund. In the few deals that they were looking at, grew on to take a role with outbound capital, a $20 million fund in New York did a seed investment with them, then grew on to take a role with Morpheus ventures, which has roughly about three $50 million in AUM la based good legacy investment team. And then lastly, worked with halogen ventures, which is a more consumer focused fund, investing in women founders. And lastly, had a role with Menlo Ventures in a in a hybrid role, both in their venture studio arm and as well as an investing role. So those are absolutely great experience. I would say, I learned quite a lot from those. All of those funds were very different in their investment thesis and focus areas. Lastly, took a lot of, I would say, student opportunities as well leadership opportunities. Developed an ecosystem ground up, developed a lot of network, which eventually allowed me to enter enter Silicon Valley as a venture investor out of my MBA. So I'm currently and senior associate at Qualcomm ventures based in the Bay Area, looking at AI investments very broadly, but at the same time, also invest in IoT, computer vision, enterprise, SAS, robotics, anything which has a degree of compute or connectivity is some, some, something that would fall in my area. I work with our Managing Director directly, and typically in us, we would aim to deploy about 150 to 100 $80 million a year. So the fund has been deploying capital quite actively, and in the last roughly about year and a two months that I've spent with the team, I've done three new investments and worked for about worked in around four to five follow on investments.

My brother is also he. He did his MBA recently from I am Calcutta. He's working in AI for a for a cement company. So broadly, probably that's, that's the background. Spent all of my childhood in Ranchi, then then worked, then spent my undergrad in Madras and worked in Bangalore for three and a half

So for any bigger project we would deal with Kuldeep would usually fly in from Mumbai, do some of those late stage deals. I was handling our Amazon account as well. So they were very good customers of ours. Would always give us opportunity for pilot. And Kuldeep was also very involved in that. So yeah, I have worked very closely with him recently. They are expanding in us. So Kuldeep frequently comes to the US. I met him last September or so, nice.

S Speaker 18:58So we are a global team. We have offices in us apart from us, one in India, which has two members right now, in Israel, China, Latin America, UK and Brazil. So a global team, for that matter, in us. We are about a 10 member team. About six of us are in Bay Area. Four of us are in San Diego, where the Qualcomm headquarter is. Everyone except from me in the team is a partner. So that's a very interesting dynamic. I would say. I get to work with almost everyone on a day to day basis. A big part of my role is also sourcing deals, because we are actively deploying I get to be quite on the ground, I'm making those relationships. I'm leveraging my network. So I meet about 50% of my time would be sourcing deals, if it is, if it is an AI deal, I get to work on the entire due diligence along with a partner. So I have, let's say, about four, five or six deals that have led the due diligence and ended up writing in a writing a term sheet. Three of those were closed. Three of those were voted out of the cap table because someone else took the entire allocation at the same time, also working with quite extensively, with some of our internal business units, and trying to see if we can add value to our portfolio companies. Try to create a coke GTM partnership, trying to do a few of engineering partnerships, things like that. Trying to also sort of work through these and create my own GTM leverage that I can like that I can use to add value to some of the companies that I meet out there in the market,

We are about a 10 member team. About six of us are in Bay Area. Four of us are in San Diego, where the Qualcomm headquarter is. Everyone except from me in the team is a partner. So that's a very interesting dynamic. I would say. I get to work with almost everyone on a day to day basis. A big part of my role is also sourcing deals, because we are actively deploying I get to be quite on the ground, I'm making those relationships. I'm leveraging my network. So I meet about 50% of my time would be sourcing deals, if it is, if it is an AI deal, I get to work on the entire due diligence along with a partner. So I have, let's say, about four, five or six deals that have led the due diligence and ended up writing in a writing a term sheet. Three of those were closed. Three of those were voted out of the cap table because someone else took the entire allocation at the same time, also working with quite extensively, with some of our internal business units, and trying to see if we can add value to our portfolio companies. Try to create a coke GTM partnership, trying to do a few of engineering partnerships, things like that. Trying to also sort of work through these and create my own GTM leverage that I can like that I can use to add value to some of the companies that I meet out there in the market,
10:42Bucha, CT, three deals that you did and three that you cooked.
Bucha, CT, three deals that you did and three that you cooked.
Bucha, CT, three deals that you did and three that you cooked.
Bucha, CT, three deals that you did and three that you cooked.
S Speaker 110:44So, yeah, the deals that I did, the most recent was, was context. Ai, it's a AI, native office suite replacement. Very interesting. Would love to talk deep in detail about that. The other two deals were in the computer, computer vision space. So one was called natodyne, which is actually an Indian founder based company natody. We did a late round. And another one was called safely you, which is a computer based, sorry, a camera based, fault detection management for elderly home care units. So three deals that I did in this space, and the three I couldn't one was called perceptron. It's an AI foundation model, but building specifically for physical AI spaces, not directly powering robotics, per se. But their journey was to power computer vision, to start with, allow advanced perception modules and eventually built towards the robotics foundation model. We could not get allocation here because Bessemer took the entire round. Another one was called Socratic AI, and another Indian founder based company. These guys early, early steed stage round. They it was a founder led bet and Lightspeed and CO two took the entire round so we didn't get allocation. They were building an AI agent for an AI agent, which would replace support engineers for complex industries, SaaS enterprise, SaaS hardware companies like Qualcomm, things like that. And the third investment we couldn't do was another AI investor, sorry, Indian based founder, straight out of Gemini steam they were building, they're still building the agent declare, a cursor like model for ml ops engineer. So the thesis being that ML ops has a lot of point solutions, very, very fragmented market, and can they build a natural language orchestrator layer on top of all of these solutions, which would allow an ML ops engineer to sort of work across this entire value chain?

S Speaker 113:08it's, it's very possible, yeah, a lot of these founders, they, they've, they have a understanding that strategics probably are better to come in at series A or later. So we usually are missing these C level AI rounds is a general theme that I've been observing.

S Speaker 114:37this. So context was sourced by me. I would say I met the founder first at a Stanford Demo Day event. But then I would also give credit to the managing partner, Tushar. He worked quite extensively with the founders to sort of establish that there is a value that Qualcomm can bring on the table. We actually did this round with general catalyst and Lux capital. So it was also a difficult to get into the cap table kind of situation, but the managing partner did quite extensive work to add value. In fact, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano, had a keynote where they presented context, and we did a lot of song and dance to get into this. But context was sourced by me. Other the other two, I would say, the team, already had connections with them. These were through some some venture funds that we very closely work with. Yeah, okay, sourced by the two Indian founder led deals were both sourced by me. The third one, perceptron, was through one company we had, Qualcomm had acquired a few a year back or so, tetra AI, and that founder is quite active in the entire startup ecosystem, so he does a lot of lead generation for us. Yeah, got it.

16:06Question for you in general, but
Question for you in general, but
Question for you in general, but
Question for you in general, but
S Speaker 216:09are there lots of Indian founders? Because that's the core part of our thesis, that you know, for somebody like us to go and in the US like, why will somebody who doesn't have some roots in India or some business in India take money from us? So I researched probably 19 95% of the deals that we do with the Indian founders. Yeah. Bucha, two questions. One, are there? Do you think there are enough? It seems like there are enough, but what is your second How are you
are there lots of Indian founders?

It seems like there are enough, but what is your second How are you
S Speaker 116:44Rajat? Yes, very, very interesting questions, because I personally have been thinking about them over the over the last few months or so. Long term, I do plan to sort of start a fund of my own, work with an or work at an Indian based fund which would also invest in us. So these are questions I always keep on pondering the first, first part of the question, I would say, yes, there are quite a few Indian based founders I am seeing roughly, I would say in my pipeline, where I track about 200 leads in the last year or so, about 30% of them have either one of their co founders as an Indian persona. These are people. These are first generation or second generation Indians, probably split 5050, and most of them are probably an IIT background, an IIT SRM, VID, background, RV, background. Engineers came to the US for their masters and stuck here, worked at a big tech fund a firm, and then have moved out to start their own funds, especially in AI. This is a very strong persona that I constantly keep seeing. In fact, a few Indian funds that I have friends in which have a similar thesis to Z 47 are also very actively tapping onto this persona. So I would say that, yes, there is a big deal flows from Indian, Indian founders here. So the second part I do both of these Indian founders, the deals that we missed I mentioned earlier. I am good friends with the founders. I try to bring value to them. I'm trying to connect them to few MLO personas, thing places they can sell connections within Qualcomm, getting them a contract from Qualcomm. So I'm trying to add value to them. And I have very essentially asked them this specific question that, hey, there are Indian funds, tier one in India, trying to expand to us. What? What would they potentially offer you to, sort of you allowing them to get on their cap table. And I think the answer there, Rajat is one trying to get there early, trying to add value to them, but at the same time, also moving very fast. I've seen these tier one funds acting really quick. Their their closing cycle is usually one to two weeks. They write smaller checks this. They are spraying and praying. They have investments in a lot of different sectors. It's kind of the DVC strategy that Z 47 is following in India. But they're moving very fast. And there is also a good understanding between a lot of these founders, even if they're not Indian origin, they understand that there's a big talent pool in India. So if someone can, very structurally, sort of introduce them to the Indian talent pool, that's also a vague value proposition that I can see which would allow us to win. Yeah,
Rajat? Yes, very, very interesting questions, because I personally have been thinking about them over the over the last few months or so.

got it. Makes sense. Make sense, why would you from Qualcomm?
S Speaker 119:46So I would say great experience in the year that I've spent here very not being in a tier one VC, but I still get to sort of talk to some of these very hot AI companies, especially given the Qualcomm's brand and the value proposition that we can create a story around. But at the same time, I've learned a lot. I've learned incredibly I've learned an incredible amount over the year, but the career path that I see in the future for myself is creating bigger, I would say, deeper, networks within Qualcomm, trying to understand Qualcomm's business, trying to sort of bring that strategic value onto the table. I currently do operate with under a lot of constraints which Qualcomm as a corporate brings in the investment mandate. I don't see that as a career that I aspire for myself. I wanted to get into venture because I wanted to be doing more early stage, concept level deals, trying to add value to these founders, trying to be more close, more hands on, probably adding a differentiated value. In a sense, the future forward for me at Qualcomm is not particularly what I want for myself, and in the long term, I want to sort of get into the more financial game of venture. Have more skin in the game, which I don't think Qualcomm would provide.

S Speaker 121:15The my family is all. All of them are still in rachi. My brother is working in Gurgaon right now, my wife is here. She recently moved. She She has reached she got a job yesterday. So she was unemployed for some period of time. Did a lot of song and dance again to get a work permit and do everything. So she recently got a job. She, she's been experimenting quite a lot with AI agents, trying to build her own stuff around that and but long term, yes, Rajat plans are to come back to India. My family is there. That's, that's a big motivation factor. My family wants me to be back. That's, that's, that's kind of a diotomy I see today. The more I spend time here, the deeper networks I build, the more difficult it would be for me to come back. But I do have plans to roughly, say from two to three years from here to come back to India.

S Speaker 123:10I would have loved to Rajat. So the managing partner that was with Qualcomm last year Carlos, he moved to Schneider electrics fund. With Carlos, we were working on a climate tech thesis, trying to see if there are a few areas we can we can specifically target grid resilience, was a thesis that we were working on. There were a lot of IoT based solutions in the grid resilience space, IoT and digital twins of grid, which would allow the grid to be more resilient. So was working on a thesis, but when Carlos left, there wasn't anyone to sort of drive that specifically for Qualcomm ventures. It wasn't also like Qualcomm ventures didn't have a big appetite for that, but I'd love to do something in climate as well.

S Speaker 124:12I think to a lot of extent, yes, it shows me as a as an extrovert. But right there, I would say, at the middle of it, 55% which I would sort of align with it. Did think of me as a tinkerer, as someone who would build new things. I align with some of those as well. I think one of the tests, unusually rated me quite high in managing my time. That's something that probably I'm a little bit worse at than the test probably depicted. But in general, yes, Rajat, I would say it was quite in line with how I would see myself.

S Speaker 224:56Yeah, correct. So you know, there was, I saw one discrepancy in the test, so I want to just cover, yeah. PTI, as you present, J ENTJ, which means, typically somebody who is, you know. So that's one, and your TMP, I'll just show you

25:24same question so
S Speaker 225:28see, this is, can you see the street? Yes, yes. This is the TMP chart. Reference my views, you know. So this is your extra version. Joe MBTI, this is almost MBTI and more big picture. This is almost like a T more analytical. This is how you organize yourself. This is exactly the opposite in your MBTI. So I had a question this, that, and goes back to time management. Are you more take it as it comes. Or do you like your calendar to be jam packed, everything you know planned? What kind of a work schedule do you follow? Yeah, I
see, this is, can you see the street? Yes, yes. This is the TMP chart. Reference my views, you know. So this is your extra version. Joe MBTI, this is almost MBTI and more big picture.

S Speaker 126:15think Rajat the discrepancy there is between how I am, personally as a person, versus how I would like my day to be structured. I am more of a flexible person. I like to take it as it goes. I like to be very flexible, be rational, try to sort of drill down into things and decide as and when it comes but at the same time, I've seen, I have been seeing more recently that that's becoming a barrier to a lot of things that I do. There are so many companies I'm meeting every day I have to sort of close the loop with everyone, do a little bit more diligence everywhere. Also bring a few companies to im meetings on Monday. So there's, there's a big calendar that I have to manage. I'm realizing that the more I set deadlines on myself, the better I am at work. So I would say I'm trying to be more structured. But in general, as a person, I'm more flexible. These things

S Speaker 228:00Yeah, yeah. So I think we have one of few funds who are well positioned to play in this entire US corridor, and we've been doing that for the last four or five years, right? So I think we've been able to get into some of the best SaaS companies, SaaS AI companies that have been started by Indian founders in India who then, after a few months or years, move to the US, and some of them nowadays travel from the best VCs in the US. So atomic work is the most recent one. So I think
Yeah, yeah. So I think we have one of few funds who are well positioned to play in this entire US corridor, and we've been doing that for the last four or five years, right?

So atomic work is the most recent one. So I think
S Speaker 228:41consistently basis, just that, right? If we continue doing our current strategy, there will be enough and more of such founders who will start from India, or will have some clear nexus to India, who will be in our network, and we can provide them some disproportionate service that a value VC may not be right. So I think we have to start from there, because doing any imagining anything else in the largest, most competitive market in the world from VC lens, I think will be delusional things. So that's going to be the start. Then I think it's a question of being able to hire one who joins us in the local team, so some of our team members from India will also believe us. Yeah, it's the people who will bring their local networks and
consistently basis, just that, right?

S Speaker 229:39of stuff VC is actually a very people dependent business. And so, for example, super we have pranaya, who came from FreshWorks. He needs us as a business. So since he's coming, every single x FreshWorks founder first comes to us, right? I think we've done 80, 90% of those deals that we need to fresh Works has bred a lot of such talent. Now, if we hire somebody from similar such who are any networks can be very different types, company specific networks. So that will be the next thing that we let her do it. But the first bread and butter would be essentially just this. To your point, either people who are in India starting out, or people who book the valley and appreciative of Nexus towards India, I think Windows also the pure values, right

S Speaker 231:24at seed stage, you are able to get a lower price, but the loss rates are also much, much higher, right? So I think we'll calibrate. It will take some time for us to get
