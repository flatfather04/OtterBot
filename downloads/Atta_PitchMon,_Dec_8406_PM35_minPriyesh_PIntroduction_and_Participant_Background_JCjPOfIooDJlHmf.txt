Hey, hi, Omar, hi. I mean, can you hear me?
Hey, hi, Omar, hi. I mean, can you hear me?
S Speaker 14:19Hey? Just yeah, hey, how's it going? Am I long time we got connected sometime back, glad to see the product is out now.
Hey? Just yeah, hey, how's it going? Am I long time we got connected sometime back, glad to see the product is out now.

Hey? Just yeah, hey, how's it going? Am I long time we got connected sometime back, glad to see the product is out now.
S Speaker 24:32Yeah, absolutely good to get to connect as well. And I know you said you're you like the space a lot. So excited to get your thoughts as we kind of walk you through it before we jump into Okay, so it's the format. I was gonna go through our intros and show you the product, and then we can leave some time to kind of have an open dialog. Would love for you to kind of kick things off and just kind of give us the lay of the land, for you on your side, to call convent tours. Not good context for us.

S Speaker 27:53Yeah, absolutely, that's great. Yeah, definitely, very exciting to hear that. I mean, definitely sounds better than like, for example, we have a Microsoft ventures, and that was a bit of a different kind of what you're talking about. Just like, Oh, do you use Azure? And all of that first question, it's like, no, we don't use Azure. We don't want to. But it's like, I can imagine.
Yeah, absolutely, that's great. Yeah, definitely, very exciting to hear that.

S Speaker 18:13Yes, I can imagine. So I'd like to get that cleared out, because that's usually one of the questions the founders

S Speaker 310:16And I'm Amin that co founder, so I'm a chief AI scientist, so I have a PhD in machine learning. Actually, I started coding at the early age. The very first like, I think app I built was a visualization tool, and I was selling that to my friend at that age, I led the team at Adobe, working on training llms. So this is machine learning team, and so even before chatgpt was out, we were training items to generate, like design variations. Also spent some time at Apple. I worked on face Id first gen on iPhone 10. So this was, like a early deep learning model on device quantized before even, like, you know, that was probably a confirmation for everyone. And then I worked on your algorithm on iPad camera as well on the voice. So, yeah, I think I have like, you know, special like, love for data visualization and analysis, and I'm glad we're working on this with Omar.

S Speaker 111:10Yeah, amazing backgrounds, guys, congrats on all the successes so far. Yeah, absolutely

Yeah, amazing backgrounds, guys, congrats on all the successes so far. Yeah, absolutely
S Speaker 114:41So, yeah, that'll be amazing, Omar. And while we're going through the demo, would be great if you can also sort of paint the picture on what the agent is doing internally, which data sources are tapping into, how's the multi agent system architected, and what models do you call? Where, where things have been fine tuned, things like that.
So, yeah, that'll be amazing, Omar.

Where, where things have been fine tuned, things like that.
S Speaker 118:16Now that's a super interesting I mean, quick couple of questions, how does the model sort of understand the semantic of the data sources, like the input file that you had, I would assume different sale, different team, have different nomenclature for salaries, and it gets quite wide if you go across all of the different functions of data that you mentioned, how do you sort of get the semantic understanding of the data first, yeah.

S Speaker 318:43So basically, so we have, we have, like, two systems. So one, we do, like, AI generated metadata. So if you upload the CSV that has no information, so we try to generate like metadata and then review it with the user. So this is how the model and sends when you have a chance to fix it. The other way is that we allow you to actually bring in that metadata through either your existence and declare or like through your metadata and snowflake. And the final point is that you can always personalize the agent, so you can add some distractions to the system prompt. So these are the metrics. This is how the funnel. So the point is make really easy for our target, ICP, so they are non technical, and you want them to, you know the business, they just don't know SQL. So they can, you can write in touch with language. And we feel, I think that's like another mode we have, because traditionally, like semantic layer has been owned by data teams, and you have to really push it to GitHub and then maintain it. Now you can build, like, no metric and test out different ideas before you can lock in a method. Is in the fashion language. Got it, sir.

S Speaker 119:45And how are some of your users using, say, a data app that they've built? Is it usually one user using it one time? Does it become, say, a data app that they use on a recurrent fashion and can you sort of trigger agentic workflows on top of the insights that the data app generates? Yeah.

S Speaker 122:06yeah, because it's essentially sort of creating small SaaS apps based on your own data for internal enterprise uses. Yeah.
yeah, because it's essentially sort of creating small SaaS apps based on your own data for internal enterprise uses. Yeah.

S Speaker 322:14So just in time analysis, just in time dashboard, just in time
So just in time analysis, just in time dashboard, just in time
So just in time analysis, just in time dashboard, just in time
So just in time analysis, just in time dashboard, just in time
S Speaker 122:18apps, right, right. And plans on sort of extending the workflow from data apps to actually taking action. Say, you're in a marketing workflow. Do you sort of use retention marketing on top of the data app that you built and send automatic emails, things like that? Do you see marketable there? And is there, say, plans to build those workflows? Yeah.
apps, right, right. And plans on sort of extending the workflow from data apps to actually taking action. Say, you're in a marketing workflow.

S Speaker 322:41So I think there are, like, you know, initial like, you know, we cannot prioritize everything, of course, or trying to prioritize what customers are telling us. But I think there is an initial kind of catch all features of, okay, you can connect MCP tools, and then now you can tell the agent to push that slice of data to whatever system that talks MCP. But then I think we monitor and see what are the most important, like workflows that users are doing, and then basically build around that,
So I think there are, like, you know, initial like, you know, we cannot prioritize everything, of course, or trying to prioritize what customers are telling us.

23:06yeah, got it. Got it. That makes sense.
yeah, got it. Got it. That makes sense.
yeah, got it. Got it. That makes sense.
yeah, got it. Got it. That makes sense.
S Speaker 123:12Omar, one question I have is a couple of companies that we have met in this space, one we have invested in, is called context. And say they are slightly adjacent, but they would work in on your on top of your data, and uncover insights I understand, they are very static, and that's one of the differentiation you emphasize on some companies that we have met in, say, revenue ops, Lifecycle Management ops, things like that, which are taking a similar approach, but very vertical. First, do you see a benefit in some of those companies being having a deeper semantic understanding of those industries, being able to sort of go deeper into the products that they build, things like that? Yeah.
Omar, one question I have is a couple of companies that we have met in this space, one we have invested in, is called context.

First, do you see a benefit in some of those companies being having a deeper semantic understanding of those industries, being able to sort of go deeper into the products that they build, things like that? Yeah.
S Speaker 223:55So the way our philosophy has been, like the platform itself, is horizontal, but the use cases and how we kind of onboard ourselves into the customers, and both in terms of usage and in terms of like mental mental model, is definitely around our use cases. And the use cases are around the biz ops. So like Biz Ops, sales ops, these people were verticalizing around their use case, use cases as our entry and so definitely the ones you're talking about where it's like, it's like, rev, op school, because I think that's actually similar to our approach, actually thinking, like, we want to be as useful to that, to that vertical, but then over time, like, the market is so big, we're going to once every once we land, we'll be able to expand. That's what we've seen already happen as well. Like became into the VP of product at one public FinTech called dave.com I have the full case study as well. Yeah. The point is, like, basically, like the VP product brought it in, and then within, you know, a few weeks now that he brought in out of finance, head of Biz Ops, like, didn't have those people also in the product as well, right? So those are, those are kinds of like motions that we've seen where once you, once you come into one silo, then the other ones will also bring in, bring their folks in. But I think, yeah, I wanted to double click on the point you were saying about the differentiation being the interactive versus static, exactly. So, like, this is kind of like, kind of market map why we're thinking about things. You know, top top, at the top is like interactive analysis. At the bottom is static, and then left and right is like, technical versus business. Top left has been like, where we see, we've seen a lot of like, traditional tooling has been built for data scientists, data teams and so like, you can do anything in there. But then, of course, you need to be technical. When AI came out a couple years ago, especially with code interpreter, if you run these, run these code, runs code. There was a bottom right new category of like, it's so easy to use, easier than spreadsheets, and a lot of the outputs were just, like, very static. It felt like, okay, I can just get this cut. But then, you know, I don't, it's, that's all I get. But then what we're trying to aim for is, like, a lot of the as easy to use as chat, GPT, but then also unlock more complicated, more interactive, more, you know, step by step, multi step analyzes that are what we're seeing again, that our business, the users and leaders are actually interested in. They don't want just answers. Because if you build only like, hey, let's make like so, so for example, perfect example is like, wisdom, right? When you kind of listen, read between the lines there, they're still doing the same motion or go to market motion is different. They're still, they're still selling to the data team. Then with the data team, they're building these agents, but they then vent out to the business team say, Okay, now you can quickly get your questions answered. But for us, we're built for the question that doesn't even exist yet. It's not even been asked yet, so we don't even know. Like, there's so many things that once the leaders are in add on, they're actually able to probe it in different ways themselves. That actually unlocks that creative thinking, and not just like, Okay, I have 50 questions. Let me just give it either to a intern, junior analyst now that junior analyst is holding up an exec on a multi, you know, million dollar, billion dollar city, or, you know, just going out, and they're able to kind of vibe themselves, and then directionally, get to that, get to that conviction. So, so as like, again, definitely, we see that interactivity as being the strongest kind of differentiator for our customers that they this is being different from other other options
So the way our philosophy has been, like the platform itself, is horizontal, but the use cases and how we kind of onboard ourselves into the customers, and both in terms of usage and in terms of like mental mental model, is definitely around our use cases.

Let me just give it either to a intern, junior analyst now that junior analyst is holding up an exec on a multi, you know, million dollar, billion dollar city, or, you know, just going out, and they're able to kind of vibe themselves, and then directionally, get to that, get to that conviction. So, so as like, again, definitely, we see that interactivity as being the strongest kind of differentiator for our customers that they this is being different from other other options
So the way our philosophy has been, like the platform itself, is horizontal, but the use cases and how we kind of onboard ourselves into the customers, and both in terms of usage and in terms of like mental mental model, is definitely around our use cases. And the use cases are around the biz ops. So like Biz Ops, sales ops, these people were verticalizing around their use case, use cases as our entry and so definitely the ones you're talking about where it's like, it's like, rev, op school, because I think that's actually similar to our approach, actually thinking, like, we want to be as useful to that, to that vertical, but then over time, like, the market is so big, we're going to once every once we land, we'll be able to expand. That's what we've seen already happen as well. Like became into the VP of product at one public FinTech called dave.com I have the full case study as well. Yeah. The point is, like, basically, like the VP product brought it in, and then within, you know, a few weeks now that he brought in out of finance, head of Biz Ops, like, didn't have those people also in the product as well, right? So those are, those are kinds of like motions that we've seen where once you, once you come into one silo, then the other ones will also bring in, bring their folks in. But I think, yeah, I wanted to double click on the point you were saying about the differentiation being the interactive versus static, exactly. So, like, this is kind of like, kind of market map why we're thinking about things. You know, top top, at the top is like interactive analysis. At the bottom is static, and then left and right is like, technical versus business. Top left has been like, where we see, we've seen a lot of like, traditional tooling has been built for data scientists, data teams and so like, you can do anything in there. But then, of course, you need to be technical. When AI came out a couple years ago, especially with code interpreter, if you run these, run these code, runs code. There was a bottom right new category of like, it's so easy to use, easier than spreadsheets, and a lot of the outputs were just, like, very static. It felt like, okay, I can just get this cut. But then, you know, I don't, it's, that's all I get. But then what we're trying to aim for is, like, a lot of the as easy to use as chat, GPT, but then also unlock more complicated, more interactive, more, you know, step by step, multi step analyzes that are what we're seeing again, that our business, the users and leaders are actually interested in. They don't want just answers. Because if you build only like, hey, let's make like so, so for example, perfect example is like, wisdom, right? When you kind of listen, read between the lines there, they're still doing the same motion or go to market motion is different. They're still, they're still selling to the data team. Then with the data team, they're building these agents, but they then vent out to the business team say, Okay, now you can quickly get your questions answered. But for us, we're built for the question that doesn't even exist yet. It's not even been asked yet, so we don't even know. Like, there's so many things that once the leaders are in add on, they're actually able to probe it in different ways themselves. That actually unlocks that creative thinking, and not just like, Okay, I have 50 questions.

S Speaker 127:09here, absolutely and and just on this chart, Omar, on the left side of the spectrum is hex, which, which you say, is optimized more for technical users. Do you see that differentiation as a big chasm between hex and ATA, or is it, just say, building a natural language interface on top of the engine that they already have?

S Speaker 227:31That's not gonna work. We talked to like hex customers. Some of our customers even have x as well. But if you talk to That's what I'm saying, like if you go from a data team first perspective, it's almost impossible to make that business user feel comfortable. You can add that chat interface, and you'll get, like, the quick kind of answer engine, which is what a x is, built snowflake. There's a lot of options there. You know, some companies have even built that internally. Right the ramp doesn't want to buy snowflake solutions. They just built it themselves. Data Team has so you can see that, that if you're playing in that playground of ideas, you're still very much serving the old garden of how it's been last 15 years. That's how we're trying to take advantage of that paradigm shift. Like, no, the leaders, they're making the decision, decisions. Like, I mean, I always laugh, like, how are you going to have, like, an exec weighing on a junior analyst to make an important decision? Right? So for us, that's what we see is fundamentally wrong with the world. And going deeper into those things where it's like, oh yeah, accent, just going to add a chat bot to their to their offerings, it's not going to really meaningfully change.

S Speaker 128:29That makes sense. Makes sense. Makes sense. Totally, totally. Omar, where are you in the journey? How many customers today? How does traction look like? How does the next sort of six, seven months look like for you? Yeah?
That makes sense. Makes sense. Makes sense. Totally, totally. Omar, where are you in the journey? How many customers today? How does traction look like? How does the next sort of six, seven months look like for you? Yeah?
That makes sense. Makes sense. Makes sense. Totally, totally. Omar, where are you in the journey? How many customers today? How does traction look like? How does the next sort of six, seven months look like for you? Yeah?
That makes sense. Makes sense. Makes sense. Totally, totally. Omar, where are you in the journey? How many customers today? How does traction look like? How does the next sort of six, seven months look like for you? Yeah?
S Speaker 228:42So when we first rolled this out, there was a lot of demand, and so what we did is we filtered down to paying design partners. Just so, like, Was that an act of, like, let's go and charge you the most money, and, like, nickel and dining, like, we were not even thinking about that, yeah? Just like, Where can we charge you a decent amount of money? It's not zero, but it's also not, you know, like, meaningful revenue that you care about this needing to show up. So that's the engagement that we've had. So it's like, okay, CB again, it's, it's not, it's pretty revenue because it's easier. Design partnerships. Anyway, we have four paying design partners, ranging from a series B startup backed by Sequoia all the way up to public fintech. So, you know, I think that's like the range of like companies where they have a lot of data and they start struggling to kind of make sense of it, which is someone manually going through, like, spreadsheets or just looking at one dashboard, like, maybe early on, that's okay. And for analysis, that's been, that's been the bread and butter kind of customer segments that we've gone after and then. But really, it really hasn't been like, let's go and get, you know, a ton of money. Yeah, we've spent the summer and, like, the last 464, to six months, iterating with these design partners, and they've pointed out, like, here's what's great, here's what's not great. And so where we are now is they've hit some, obviously, some fixable issues in the product, right? Because, like, they love the analysis. They can give it three months now they want 12 months. Now they want more compute. They want more complicated layerings of like you said, they weren't agentic. They wanted to be ambient. They want all these kind of things. And so these are all we know we can do these things. And so that's paid back, back up. Time to raise. We validated we raise a small amount with Menlo, validated some of our hypotheses, and now it's time to take it to the next step. And so we have, yeah, for paying design partners. We've started the funding fundraising process and prescribing to take second meetings.

S Speaker 130:24Now, got it, got it, got it. And and Omar, so you mentioned five to seven. 7 million raise roughly, takes you another 7 million of runway. What all milestones do you plan to hit by then, before the next round?
Now, got it, got it, got it. And and Omar, so you mentioned five to seven. 7 million raise roughly, takes you another 7 million of runway. What all milestones do you plan to hit by then, before the next round?
Now, got it, got it, got it. And and Omar, so you mentioned five to seven. 7 million raise roughly, takes you another 7 million of runway. What all milestones do you plan to hit by then, before the next round?

S Speaker 230:37Yeah, I think milestones like, we're we're like, listen, disguise, Linda, we've seen, you know, when AI products, really, they fit the, you know, like a puzzle piece that the world is missing, you know. So it's really, like, we're not really targeting, like, a number. It could be, you know, X million. Like, let's, let's just put it out there. But, but for us, from a from like, achievement perspective, like, we're gonna launch, and so we'll see. Because we feel like we've gotten this pull from really sophisticated customers who have options, and they've seen everything. These are not randoms we found on Reddit. So it's like, because of this type of like, like, sophisticated customer excitement, we know that there's a lot more of them. There's not only these four that we've you know they're working with right now. Yeah. And so once we kind of open that up there, I think the sky's the limit for there. From the revenue acquisition perspective, we're just gonna be full speed ahead at that point.
Yeah, I think milestones like, we're we're like, listen, disguise, Linda, we've seen, you know, when AI products, really, they fit the, you know, like a puzzle piece that the world is missing, you know.

S Speaker 131:26Yeah, got it. And Omar, when did you start? How big? How big is the team now? And is it? Is it SF based?
Yeah, got it. And Omar, when did you start? How big? How big is the team now? And is it? Is it SF based?
Yeah, got it. And Omar, when did you start? How big? How big is the team now? And is it? Is it SF based?
Yeah, got it. And Omar, when did you start? How big? How big is the team now? And is it? Is it SF based?
S Speaker 231:32Yeah, we're all here, you know. We do want to, after our next round, give an office. So we're going to be in the office as well. And so we just have been kind of lean the teams local, but we just kind of work remotely. We're up to five. That's the five that we showed you earlier. So that's the core team, yeah, yeah, this is the team. And then yeah. So, so we started, I mean, what it was, just mean, I mean, it was like last summer that Menlo put in their first money in September. We iterated with them customer validation. I'm sure you're familiar with the process of Ryan and other folks there run. We did that. We raised our pre seed. That's when Raj and Amra Dale got involved. It was back in February. We closed that round. And so, yeah, we've just been then we hired the full team since June. We had the full team in place, isn't basically the last, like six months
Yeah, we're all here, you know. We do want to, after our next round, give an office. So we're going to be in the office as well. And so we just have been kind of lean the teams local, but we just kind of work remotely. We're up to five. That's the five that we showed you earlier.

And so we just have been kind of lean the teams local, but we just kind of work remotely. We're up to five. That's the five that we showed you earlier. So that's the core team, yeah, yeah, this is the team. And then yeah. So, so we started, I mean, what it was, just mean, I mean, it was like last summer that Menlo put in their first money in September. We iterated with them customer validation. I'm sure you're familiar with the process of Ryan and other folks there run. We did that. We raised our pre seed. That's when Raj and Amra Dale got involved. It was back in February. We closed that round. And so, yeah, we've just been then we hired the full team since June. We had the full team in place, isn't basically the last, like six months

S Speaker 132:39Got it correct. Understood, understood Omar. So certainly very interesting. Let me do a round of review. On my end, I would like to have set up another call with Tushar from my team who leads Qualcomm ventures, US investments. So I'll set up set that up as the next step. Meanwhile, may come back to you with some async questions on my end that we can always answer on email, have that call, and we can quickly sort of get back to you on where we stand by early next week. I think the major sort of discussion factor within the team would roughly be around the round, round size, say, and the stage, do we come in at seed? Do we wait, say, another six, seven months and come in for with a larger check in the next round. So that is something we will discuss internally, and then I can quickly get back to you.

S Speaker 133:36So I think, or if you do this, our check sizes, we would not be able to lead. I think for most of the investments we do, we sort of participate roughly 20% deals we would lead other than, but it's, it needs to be highly strategic for us to lead around here. I believe we would be a follow on check. And given the round size, something like a $2 million makes sense for us the smallest size,
