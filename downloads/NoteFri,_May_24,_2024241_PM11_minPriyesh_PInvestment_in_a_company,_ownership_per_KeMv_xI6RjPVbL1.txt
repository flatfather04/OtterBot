S Speaker 16:30Okay, so now you're getting 120 million to use by eight. So that's an extra investing 100 times investing an extra 400k buys us an extra zero point 36% of the company. And so our ownership will go from the 2.8 What was it 2.85 2.81

S Speaker 18:59we do we say this, this round is enough or whatever. So looks like it's not. Okay. All right. So for Monday, let's do these updates. And then we'll basically say look, it's small dollars. We could make an extra money but there's the risk, you know, of our ownership is so small I wanted to increase ownership. Because you know, there's no way we're gonna get to proceeds of 30 Right? Yeah, like to get we want to aim for first seeds, right. So realistically, you know, we need to keep increasing ownership. Yeah. And so the next question is, right, if it's 170 the next round will there be another round? Right, and at which point we want to double the height by dad if we have more visibly the business really taking off and the exit is more like a billion dollar exit. Right. Anyway, sounds good. Okay,
