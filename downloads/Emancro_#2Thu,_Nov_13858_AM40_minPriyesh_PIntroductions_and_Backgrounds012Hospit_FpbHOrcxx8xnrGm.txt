S Speaker 12:46So my background is engineering product. I'm very, very familiar with robotics over the years. My background in computer vision and and then now I manage the North America investments ventures for Qualcomm ventures. And then so robotics, in general is, is a very strategic area of interest for Qualcomm. So we're working with many robotics companies. We're building a whole bunch of platforms for robotics and so looking forward to learning more today,

3:37quickly. Get water.
S Speaker 43:39Yeah, yeah. Can All
S Speaker 33:56right, cool. So a little bit about my own background. So I'm I did research for six years at Berkeley, working with Surrey lemon Chelsea Finn. Before that, I did a master's in AI and robotics, and my focus area was basically the early versions of foundation models. We did a lot of imitation learning, large scale data learning, and I was working at Google as well with Eric Jim and Corey Lynch, who are now the heads of AI at one at configured I also had some early books on world models. And it was always my mission, my goal, to bring these algorithms into impactful and meaningful applications in the real world. And then I hired a team across academia, industry and healthcare, and we decided to go into into hospital automation. And the reason why is because, on the one hand, we have a tremendous labor shortage. Many hospitals just can't feel fill the labor gap. They're relying on 10 staff and agencies. Their vacancy rates of north of 22% in, for example, hospital, pharmacy and many other areas. We know that margins are much higher than, for example, in warehousing, and even higher than manufacturing, actually. And we know that it's a it's a huge use case in terms of there's so many different tasks to do. You can definitely pick out a small wedge to start and then branch out and expand within the healthcare sector. For example, there is when we got started, we analyzed all these different workflows, and we found that there are hundreds of tasks that we can potentially automate. And so we talked to hundreds of different staff, visited dozens of different hospitals, and decided to start with medication distribution, which means that so in medications diffusion the medication needs to be distributed to all these different medication, cabinets, there are 200 of them throughout the hospital, and the robot.

S Speaker 37:16And so the reason why hospital pharmacy is a great initial use case is because there's a huge budget here. So it's $80 million a year for the entire department. $30 million is for staffing and equipment and could be used towards robotics. In a typical corner bed hustle, you'll have around 64 pharmacy technicians who work 24 hours a day handling up to 10,000 doses and doing medication distribution will not require FDA, because it's basically just moving around meds is not therapeutic, so it's really at the discretion of the hospital to decide whether to use it, and there's huge turnover. So it's an enormous pain that they have right now because of labor shortage, they have expired medication accumulating in the cabinets, leading to up to half a million dollars of waste per year. Also, it's, of course, dangerous for patients expired meds, and then their critical shortages often admit surgery that they run out of medication, and that can certainly be fixed if robots disagree

S Speaker 38:19So it's taking the medication from the basement of the hospital, from the central pharmacy, and then delivering it to the various medication cabinets, and then sorting it into the cabinets got and I'm going to show you in more detail how this looks like in practice. So this is this is where the robots would fit in. So this is how the storage looks like in the central pharmacy. It's a carousel. So we need to pick the medication here and then distribute it to those 200 medication cabinets in the hospital. And so here's an example of a technician checking count the quantity, check the expiration date, and then type the nearest expiration date on the screen. That's super error prone. It takes about 20 minutes just to do one cabinet. We need to do these cabinets twice a day. And, yeah, it's very labor intensive.

S Speaker 29:03And how many cabinets? Typically two, 200 so it'll be like 40 minutes worth of work twice a day, which is 80 minutes worth of work, right for

S Speaker 39:14this that that's one thing, but you also need to, of course, retrieve the medication from the from the storage, do the inventory. So in total, there are 64 pharmacy technicians. The total work breakdown is, is this? So the medication distribution accounts for about 45% of their work. There's inventory management, there's sterile compounding, which is like putting, like making custom ID bags with custom solutions, some admin work. And out of the medication distribution, we should be able to automate at least 80% and out of the inventory management around 70 and that should be around 23 staff here, seven staff here. So totally we would free up up to 31 staff in a large system for that hospital.

10:02Okay. And does that so,

10:08am I saying your name? Right?
am I saying your name? Right?
am I saying your name? Right?

10:09Yes, Frederick, that's right.
Yes, Frederick, that's right.
Yes, Frederick, that's right.
Yes, Frederick, that's right.
S Speaker 210:13And just do these 31 people. Just do that task alone at a hospital, or do they? Are they doing other things when they're not doing this?
And just do these 31 people. Just do that task alone at a hospital, or do they? Are they doing other things when they're not doing this?

And just do these 31 people. Just do that task alone at a hospital, or do they? Are they doing other things when they're not doing this?
S Speaker 310:30So that's what these 80% are basically conveying here. So it's not like there's some corner cases, some things that that these robots will not do. It's basically, we estimate around 80% of that work should be automatable, and there's some work that is still at the limit of dexterity. For example, sometimes these vials are wrapped in plastic and individual needs to be worn open. So that will come later. As the dexterity increases, we will push further and push this up to eventually 90% and more.
So that's what these 80% are basically conveying here. So it's not like there's some corner cases, some things that that these robots will not do.

11:09But what about like
S Speaker 211:12when this person is not doing medication distribution? Is that person
when this person is not doing medication distribution? Is that person
when this person is not doing medication distribution? Is that person
when this person is not doing medication distribution? Is that person
11:17also doing something else?
also doing something else?
also doing something else?
also doing something else?
S Speaker 311:20So there are, as I said, so these multiple different tasks to do. So there could be a person the same person. So, yeah, it's not like a clear so the person people have overlap. So there's a total of 64 and a person could be spending some hours in medication institutions, some hours in inventory management, some hours in compounding. So it's not like there's clear separation, like this person is only doing this and that person is only doing that. It's a more dynamic.
So there are, as I said, so these multiple different tasks to do. So there could be a person the same person. So, yeah, it's not like a clear so the person people have overlap.

S Speaker 211:49So see, the question with robots in general, in the past has always been see as we look into different types of robots, pre the general purpose robots, even the ROI challenge has always been that in real environments, humans are like, for example, I don't know how the workflow in a hospital for this particular use cases, but, but a person in a certain part of the hospital is doing five six different tasks. And it's not like, if you can replace that one task with a robot, you can fire this person just because that person, just for efficiency reasons that they have, they're in that location. So at that given point in time, they're also multitasking. They're doing other tasks. So unless you can replace almost most of the tasks that that person does in that particular location of that facility, the ROI calculations did change drastically, and then, so it's not that you can now replace these robots with 31 people. It ends up becoming significantly lower. Is what like in the past that's that's our experience been in with robots, and we've got a budget portfolio company. Same experience. Now the question with general purpose robots that the question that we are asking is, does this get to high ROI? Because now you can do really,

So at that given point in time, they're also multitasking. They're doing other tasks. So unless you can replace almost most of the tasks that that person does in that particular location of that facility, the ROI calculations did change drastically, and then, so it's not that you can now replace these robots with 31 people. It ends up becoming significantly lower. Is what like in the past that's that's our experience been in with robots, and we've got a budget portfolio company. Same experience. Now the question with general purpose robots that the question that we are asking is, does this get to high ROI? Because now you can do really,

Now the question with general purpose robots that the question that we are asking is, does this get to high ROI? Because now you can do really,
S Speaker 313:35yes, it does get to high ROI, and it can be scaled from like one robot deployed all the way to 15 robots deployed. So like in the let's say, final use case where we deploy 15 robots and we free up 31 technicians, that's a very drastic saving of 1.4 million. But you can start with just one robot. So one robot, you can absolutely get busy, and then we can scale this up to 15 robots that would be accounting for the entire medication distribution and inventory. So this is, and this is still like making realistic assumptions that we're not doing everything, and we have, you're still having 32 technicians. So if there are tasks the robot can't do, well, that's the job of those 32 technicians, right? So they're basically collaborating with the robots, providing the compliment, complimentary. It's a collaboration between robots and technicians, and the technicians focus on stuff that robots are bad at, and the robots are focusing on stuff that they're good at is, which is precision, repeatability, the bulk of the handling work, and the technicians do the task that robots are bad at, which is like some coordinate cases with like plastic wrapping, and then some communication, like calling people, coordinating, removing obstacles. And so our estimate is that we can get 120% ri So assuming the robots will be made at $20,000 at 300 units, there would be a $5,000 tele operator cost, since the robots will be operated and watched by so they will be watched by tele operators if something like if they get stuck, if there's a situation robot can't handle, hotel operator will overcome that situation, and that will result in a payback period of around Three months.

15:38Are you going to charge an upfront cost?
Are you going to charge an upfront cost?
Are you going to charge an upfront cost?
Are you going to charge an upfront cost?
S Speaker 315:41No, it'll be a pure brass model at the $80,000 a year per robot, 24 hours per day. And yeah. So that will allow us to account for the training cost, our compute costs. And yeah. Okay. Cool. Yeah. Let me walk you through a little bit. I should probably tell you about the pilot. So let's
No, it'll be a pure brass model at the $80,000 a year per robot, 24 hours per day. And yeah. So that will allow us to account for the training cost, our compute costs. And yeah. Okay. Cool. Yeah. Let me walk you through a little bit. I should probably tell you about the pilot. So let's

16:10look at the robot you had in the previous slide.
look at the robot you had in the previous slide.
look at the robot you had in the previous slide.
look at the robot you had in the previous slide.

This one, no, no, go back. So
16:17what are you interested in?
what are you interested in?
what are you interested in?
what are you interested in?
16:19Like, how does that robot look is that?
Like, how does that robot look is that?
Like, how does that robot look is that?
Like, how does that robot look is that?
S Speaker 316:24Yeah, so I'm introducing, I haven't introduced the robot yet, so there are multiple steps here. So the first step is it would get the supplies from the shelf using its hands. It picks the boxes which are containing the supplies. It then restocks these drawers on the robot. Then it drives as a fully mobile robot. It would be driving throughout the hospital and then delivering. So it'll log into the cabinet by typing and authenticating, alternatively electronically. And now the cabinet opens up, the drawers unfold and it begins to restocking all these meds into the cabinet. So it uses a suction to handle items, which is great for like small, slippery items, and the hands are used for larger items, like boxes, trays, doors and so on. Here's a barcode scanner that allows it to roll these items, to scan the barcode and read the expiration date to check if everything's done correctly. And here's what really excels. It's much more reliable than humans. So humans had a 4% error rate, this will be close to zero. And so it's going to be a no brainer.

Got it? Okay, okay, okay, interesting.
S Speaker 318:21So we're the only company that has been able to develop a system that can really dynamic. Yeah, and it's just really crucial, because hands are still not good enough for many of these very like slippery vials. It's actually much better to continue suction, and as we show later, we can actually pick up multiple items per hand. So you can see we can do two items per hand at the same time.
So we're the only company that has been able to develop a system that can really dynamic. Yeah, and it's just really crucial, because hands are still not good enough for many of these very like slippery vials.

19:33Okay? And today,
S Speaker 219:37Frederick, how do these, the technicians that are filling these cabinets. What did they bring? Like, they bring a bag,
Frederick, how do these, the technicians that are filling these cabinets. What did they bring? Like, they bring a bag,
Frederick, how do these, the technicians that are filling these cabinets. What did they bring? Like, they bring a bag,
Frederick, how do these, the technicians that are filling these cabinets. What did they bring? Like, they bring a bag,
S Speaker 319:47they bring a cart, and then they have a plastic pouch, yeah, and fill it.
they bring a cart, and then they have a plastic pouch, yeah, and fill it.
they bring a cart, and then they have a plastic pouch, yeah, and fill it.
they bring a cart, and then they have a plastic pouch, yeah, and fill it.
S Speaker 219:53Got it? Okay? So they don't have another set of cabinet, like, like a cabinet with drawers, the one that is on this robot, they don't have a similar, like a cabinet that they're using to fill in to this other cabinet.
Got it? Okay? So they don't have another set of cabinet, like, like a cabinet with drawers, the one that is on this robot, they don't have a similar, like a cabinet that they're using to fill in to this other cabinet.
Got it? Okay? So they don't have another set of cabinet, like, like a cabinet with drawers, the one that is on this robot, they don't have a similar, like a cabinet that they're using to fill in to this other cabinet.

S Speaker 220:43And so you're going to sell this whole unit to the hospital, or lease this whole unit to the hospital. That's right, got it?
And so you're going to sell this whole unit to the hospital, or lease this whole unit to the hospital. That's right, got it?
And so you're going to sell this whole unit to the hospital, or lease this whole unit to the hospital. That's right, got it?
And so you're going to sell this whole unit to the hospital, or lease this whole unit to the hospital. That's right, got it?
S Speaker 320:50Okay? And so they're actually more use cases. So there's a tray assembly use case as well. They need medication trace assembled. And so that's a very nice and small, self contained use case within the central pharmacy. Doesn't require you to drive through the entire hospital. That's our first product that we're actually selling. And the next one is, as I mentioned, the hospital wide restocking of medication candidate. And both will deliver around 120% ri 150 items for hours, the current speed, with 24/7 uptime, and these last steps, the tray assembly and the Cabinet restocking, is what we piloted at Mayo Clinic. So we went through economics already. So
Okay? And so they're actually more use cases. So there's a tray assembly use case as well. They need medication trace assembled.

S Speaker 221:32you gave Mayo Clinic, how many of these?
you gave Mayo Clinic, how many of these?
you gave Mayo Clinic, how many of these?
you gave Mayo Clinic, how many of these?
21:36The pilot was with one robot,
The pilot was with one robot,
The pilot was with one robot,
The pilot was with one robot,
S Speaker 221:38with one robot, and then, so this was at one of their facilities. Yes, when did you pilot this
with one robot, and then, so this was at one of their facilities. Yes, when did you pilot this
with one robot, and then, so this was at one of their facilities. Yes, when did you pilot this
with one robot, and then, so this was at one of their facilities. Yes, when did you pilot this
21:47in September, in September
in September, in September
in September, in September
in September, in September
21:49and and then they,
21:55yeah, so let's cool.
S Speaker 222:55So so right now you have, do you have one robot, or how many robots you have? Three, okay, that you can pilot, how fast can and then, Frederick, are you going to make like most of the robots are going to look same as these, the robot with the drawers, or they're
So so right now you have, do you have one robot, or how many robots you have? Three, okay, that you can pilot, how fast can and then, Frederick, are you going to make like most of the robots are going to look same as these, the robot with the drawers, or they're
So so right now you have, do you have one robot, or how many robots you have? Three, okay, that you can pilot, how fast can and then, Frederick, are you going to make like most of the robots are going to look same as these, the robot with the drawers, or they're
So so right now you have, do you have one robot, or how many robots you have? Three, okay, that you can pilot, how fast can and then, Frederick, are you going to make like most of the robots are going to look same as these, the robot with the drawers, or they're
23:17going to look different.
going to look different.
going to look different.
going to look different.
S Speaker 323:18So for the first the first product, so the tray assembly use cases, we're going to be shipping the current robot that where we have we are also developing a next generation system. So here's the commercial rollout plan. So we've done the initial pilot. We're doing paid pilots in q1 validating the reliability, and then doing it integrations and fleet management, and then getting ready to a permanent deployment in around q3 next year, with four to six robots in four hospitals, okay, and then the next generation robot is already under development, which is a more compact robot that will have paid pilots, and then it will be full scale deployed in q1 27 will have additional pilots for supplies, linen and food and all several other tasks as well. That's the point of the new robot, is it's going to be more flexible. It can go into patients rooms. It can go anywhere a human can go.

S Speaker 324:37yeah, yeah. How works at the drawers are gonna be on separate runner robots. As you can see here, there are two runner robots that will transport the meds. So it's highly modular. You'll have the suction tools that pick up the files so it can do everything, or task roller can do, and way more. Since this is highly modular, you can have like trays and trays live in these. This is far more modular and experiment.

S Speaker 225:01Yeah, and Freddie, why don't you go with this to
Yeah, and Freddie, why don't you go with this to
Yeah, and Freddie, why don't you go with this to
Yeah, and Freddie, why don't you go with this to
S Speaker 325:05begin with? Because the hardware wasn't available

S Speaker 325:13So we're leveraging a an existing humanoid software, what we're buying from another company, and before we integrated, or one of those, when we developed it, it wasn't available. Though, if the it's basically these, this robot that we're going to be buying here is a fully integrated human right, with wheels, with this kind of kinematic structure. It wasn't there. So now it just came out.

Also, this is you're not going to build these robots.
Also, this is you're not going to build these robots.
Also, this is you're not going to build these robots.
S Speaker 325:42So our strategy is this, initially, we buy the robot, and then we need to get the costs down right. So when we buy the robot, it's still rather expensive. So we need to get, eventually, to really get very good unit economics. When you get down to 20k the best way to do this is through a vertical integration, by building this in house, but it also takes a lot of capital to develop and time so to get to the market ASAP, we're buying a third party robot, humanoid on wheel, from a company, and that will allow us to immediately scale and deploy robots on a wider scale many hospitals, so We can really get this into the into the field by q1 next year. And all we need to do is we need to add some tools and, like, add these runner robots, so it's a little bit integration, but that allows us a very quick to market,

S Speaker 226:35okay, and at that point, I guess then, would you be customizing any part of the hardware.
okay, and at that point, I guess then, would you be customizing any part of the hardware.
okay, and at that point, I guess then, would you be customizing any part of the hardware.
okay, and at that point, I guess then, would you be customizing any part of the hardware.
S Speaker 326:41Yes, the suction tools. These are custom. No one else has these. And, yeah, the runner robots need to be communicating with this robot as well. So the runner robots will be also customized, like industrial components, customized for our use case.
Yes, the suction tools. These are custom. No one else has these. And, yeah, the runner robots need to be communicating with this robot as well. So the runner robots will be also customized, like industrial components, customized for our use case.

S Speaker 226:59Okay, got it, but everything else you can buy off the shelf, yeah, yeah. So production schedule for this, if you go back to that schedule slide, yeah,
Okay, got it, but everything else you can buy off the shelf, yeah, yeah. So production schedule for this, if you go back to that schedule slide, yeah,
Okay, got it, but everything else you can buy off the shelf, yeah, yeah. So production schedule for this, if you go back to that schedule slide, yeah,
Okay, got it, but everything else you can buy off the shelf, yeah, yeah. So production schedule for this, if you go back to that schedule slide, yeah,
S Speaker 327:13right. So the time we have here is mostly software integration, so we don't have any hardware development plan, which is good, yeah,
right. So the time we have here is mostly software integration, so we don't have any hardware development plan, which is good, yeah,
right. So the time we have here is mostly software integration, so we don't have any hardware development plan, which is good, yeah,
right. So the time we have here is mostly software integration, so we don't have any hardware development plan, which is good, yeah,
S Speaker 327:44Yeah, so today it'll, it'll be around $50,000 for this robot. And I think when we make this ourselves, we can get down to 20k pretty easily. But it's okay to have like, you know, if we can make, we can charge 80k per year. We don't have to make make profits from day one. And of course, there's a tele operator time here. You know, like the operator time, it's not exactly clear how many hours of operator time we'll need, right? So if it's like a bit more operator time, then it'll take a bit longer with the payback period. But like, yeah, that three three months is assuming the 20k Got it.
Yeah, so today it'll, it'll be around $50,000 for this robot. And I think when we make this ourselves, we can get down to 20k pretty easily.

S Speaker 228:20So what's your view on, you know, the general so it seems, see your, what I see, you're working on general purpose brain, and then going after vertical to go solve it first, and then within that vertical there's enough general purpose tasks for you to train on. What's your view on? Like, what's your you given your first slide? It seems you're very plugged into the physical intelligence and skilled AI approaches of the world. What's your view on just building a general purpose intelligence and then, and then being able to deploy it and all these different form factors?

What's your view on just building a general purpose intelligence and then, and then being able to deploy it and all these different form factors?
S Speaker 329:11Yeah. So we are developing our our own custom DLA as well. So this is based on open source work. Actually, the entire industry is basing their work on open source and so that's also what we do. So we train this model in house. We're not reliant on any we're not reliant on any other third party company to provide us with this model. We are collecting a lot of very valuable proprietary data from our deployments that will be our edge, and meanwhile, we'll always compare multiple different models and have our own modifications and versions of it. There are some custom dual arm motion planner systems as well that allow us to use the arms in parallel to do tasks for doubling the speed. There are a lot of user interfaces around that, custom integrations with hospital it task management. So there's a lot of a lot of moat being built around the AI, around the interfaces, around the data and and then so many companies are pushing world models, or like foundation models right now, that prices for that are going to be like, going down to the really, really low. It has so much competition between physical intelligence generalists and these companies that we can basically, and then open source, like Chinese companies are pushing open source models, right? There's so many models. Like, I mean, deep sea when, like, it's a million models out there, right? So if you, if you spend like, $100 million making your own foundation models, like, it's really what like, it's really wasted, because you're not going to compete against Chinese open source, right? So now what we're going to do is we're going to own the end user. We're going to own the we're going to make the cash at our customer, and then we're going to choose the cheapest model and customize it and perfect it, just we get the highest performance, and then eventually, as we get more data, we can build more custom, more better, better integrations, vertically integrated, we can achieve higher performance than other companies who don't own the hardware, right? So we can get higher performance at the end of the day. And yeah. So already now we see that with our official server algorithm, we can do a highly reactive visual server that can pick up small items like vials down to six millimeters, and we have this supervised dynamic autonomy, but we collect like 1000s of trajectories every single day from our various deployments. And I think that's where the mode really comes to grow. And it's like we're going to have so much experience really deploying robots in the real world, like expanding the use cases that, I think a foundation model company that has a warehouse with robots to just tally off, or they buy expensive data from other companies, I don't think they can compete in the long run.
Yeah. So we are developing our our own custom DLA as well. So this is based on open source work. Actually, the entire industry is basing their work on open source and so that's also what we do.

Yeah, and I, I think, yeah, I'm also wondering, because,
32:10yeah, I mean, just
S Speaker 232:12building the brain of the robot and not owning the customer in this space might be challenging, I think, yeah, over the long run. And so how much have you raised? Frederick? And then this is your series, a

S Speaker 332:29so we've raised 4.2 million so far across a pre seed round, which was led by coastal ventures, a seed round that is led by AIX. So together, it was group 4.2 now we're raising 8 million, and this, I would consider a pre a I mean, we're pre revenue right now, so 8 million, I think, is a good trade off to make fast progress on the on the product development, and not like going too crazy and getting too we're trying to be very capital efficient. We did this all from 4.2 million, and I'm going to stay that capital efficient. How

so we've raised 4.2 million so far across a pre seed round, which was led by coastal ventures, a seed round that is led by AIX. So together, it was group 4.2 now we're raising 8 million, and this, I would consider a pre a I mean, we're pre revenue right now, so 8 million, I think, is a good trade off to make fast progress on the on the product development, and not like going too crazy and getting too we're trying to be very capital efficient. We did this all from 4.2 million, and I'm going to stay that capital efficient. How
33:01many people do you have? We are eight people full time
many people do you have? We are eight people full time
many people do you have? We are eight people full time
many people do you have? We are eight people full time
33:05right now. Eight, yeah, yeah.
right now. Eight, yeah, yeah.
right now. Eight, yeah, yeah.
right now. Eight, yeah, yeah.
S Speaker 233:07And then I guess with $8 million you have runway Till when
And then I guess with $8 million you have runway Till when
And then I guess with $8 million you have runway Till when
And then I guess with $8 million you have runway Till when
S Speaker 333:1418 months is the plan. 18 months, okay,
18 months is the plan. 18 months, okay,
18 months is the plan. 18 months, okay,
18 months is the plan. 18 months, okay,
S Speaker 233:18yeah, got it. And you're looking for a lead right now, right?
yeah, got it. And you're looking for a lead right now, right?
yeah, got it. And you're looking for a lead right now, right?
yeah, got it. And you're looking for a lead right now, right?
S Speaker 333:22So, yes, we are looking for a lead. And coastal Ventures is right now talking with Mayo Clinic, so they will very likely come in. So of course, yeah. So they're talking with mayo clinic right now. It's like advanced due diligence. So yeah, I think they're, they're happy with our progress. So I don't see a reason why they wouldn't
So, yes, we are looking for a lead. And coastal Ventures is right now talking with Mayo Clinic, so they will very likely come in. So of course, yeah. So they're talking with mayo clinic right now.

S Speaker 233:45Okay, yeah, oh, got it, got it. Got it, okay. And Frederick, it seems so you are running compute on whatever the robot has, right?
Okay, yeah, oh, got it, got it. Got it, okay. And Frederick, it seems so you are running compute on whatever the robot has, right?
Okay, yeah, oh, got it, got it. Got it, okay. And Frederick, it seems so you are running compute on whatever the robot has, right?
Okay, yeah, oh, got it, got it. Got it, okay. And Frederick, it seems so you are running compute on whatever the robot has, right?
S Speaker 333:59Yes, and the cloud as well. So actually, what's happening is that this VLA, the inference, is running on a server. And think of it as a planner. It kind of plans the next two seconds of the robot, and then it gets executed at high speed on the hardware drivers.
Yes, and the cloud as well. So actually, what's happening is that this VLA, the inference, is running on a server. And think of it as a planner. It kind of plans the next two seconds of the robot, and then it gets executed at high speed on the hardware drivers.

S Speaker 234:16But in a lot of these regulated industries, are they okay?
But in a lot of these regulated industries, are they okay?
But in a lot of these regulated industries, are they okay?
But in a lot of these regulated industries, are they okay?
S Speaker 334:18Like, oh, when I say cloud, okay, so the server could be in the hospital as
Like, oh, when I say cloud, okay, so the server could be in the hospital as
Like, oh, when I say cloud, okay, so the server could be in the hospital as
Like, oh, when I say cloud, okay, so the server could be in the hospital as
S Speaker 134:26well. Server, yeah,
S Speaker 334:30yeah. So I guess I said you can do cloud, and there are cloud applications in the hospital, but then you have to really, like, show like, why you're hyper compliant. Like, you have to prove to them that, like, yeah, you're raising faces. You're not doing any personally identifiable information, yeah.
yeah. So I guess I said you can do cloud, and there are cloud applications in the hospital, but then you have to really, like, show like, why you're hyper compliant.

S Speaker 234:49I mean, yeah, technically yes. Cloud will work, because if you have two seconds then with the round trip, it should be okay. But, but, but these regulated industry, especially hospitals, and, you know, they just want everything, yeah, to not leave the premises. Okay, so got it, okay. So, so you're you, but, so this is their on prem server. Or you put a box,
I mean, yeah, technically yes. Cloud will work, because if you have two seconds then with the round trip, it should be okay.

So, so you're you, but, so this is their on prem server. Or you put a box,
S Speaker 335:19we will put an on prem server there, and I think it'll it'll pay off, because we have one server that can service the entire fleet of robots. So as long as you have, like, more than couple of robots, it'll be fine.
we will put an on prem server there, and I think it'll it'll pay off, because we have one server that can service the entire fleet of robots. So as long as you have, like, more than couple of robots, it'll be fine.
