S Speaker 10:38can't hear you. How are you doing? I'm doing great. Thanks a lot for taking the time where you based? I'm based in the Miami area. Oh, wow, that must be fun. What about you? I'm in San Francisco, so, same old San Francisco. Oh, that's fun, though.

S Speaker 10:57been good. It's been good. It's been quite busy as well. I think the first quarter for Qualcomm Ventures has been quite active. We have been deploying capital quite actively, so a lot of companies to look at using funds so far. Yes, that's great. How about you? Geoff, we got connected through Mike, so I am coming in a little bit cold into this. I haven't looked at any materials. I have done a little bit of desktop research on my own. So I do understand the space a little bit, but would sort of rely on you to take me through this entire journey, how you're thinking about it, where's the company placed now? What are the future milestones, things like that, and then maybe before we start, I can give you a background about myself and the fund, how we operate, the things we look at, and what sort of makes a fit for us?

S Speaker 24:04You know, I think you know, we're, we're, we're at the 10 million ARR mark. So that's where we're at. We're looking at raising, potentially a series B, right? Like a 20 million Series B? So, yeah, I wasn't sure. Do you guys lead, co lead participate?
You know, I think you know, we're, we're, we're at the 10 million ARR mark. So that's where we're at. We're looking at raising, potentially a series B, right? Like a 20 million Series B? So, yeah, I wasn't sure. Do you guys lead, co lead participate?

S Speaker 14:23So yeah, about 80% of our deals, we would just participate probably in 20% of deals we have led. But I would say we are more participating than leading checks, and specifically in the context of data plot, I don't think it's in our core sort of business focus. So it would be where we would sort of participate with more financial lead in place.

S Speaker 24:46Cool, cool, good to know. Awesome. Yeah. So a little bit you know about about DataBlock and our journey. So when we first started the company, I was actually working with a guy who was the CEO of info group, a 500 million AR data company, and he was telling me, hey, like location data in the United States, there's a lot of players out there, but when it comes to global no one's really saw global location data. So knowing where Jim's Cafe is in Mexico City, or knowing where Jim's Cafe is in Mumbai, right? Like, it's really hard to get that data and have it accurate. And so I saw that as a great problem, and so our first iteration of the business was actually to go out and use feed on the street in Mexico. We had a mobile app, and we would capture information like, what credit cards are they using the point of sale? We had some good customers, but we ended up in a services business. So we ended up pivoting in 2020 to a database subscription business. And what we do today is we take down 1000s of website, publicly available websites. So think of government registries, like the Mexican government database, right? We take down sites, select like site sites, and think about like the Starbucks store locator website, right? And then we take down crowdsource website, so like the yellow pages of Mexico, we'll take that all down. We've built out our own AI and ML algorithms to merge match and to deep that data, and then we have humans in the loop for anything our AI can't fix, to manually verify that data and fix it. And at the end of this process, we end up with a clean record a Jim's cafe at 123, Main Street in San Francisco, with 50 other attributes associated to it, such as, how does it perform? Like it's foot traffic, hours of operations, credit cards and our database is incredibly accurate. Microsoft, one of our customers, makes us at being 90% accurate or more, and our competitors being 20% accurate globally. And so, yeah, we started in Mexico, we expanded to Latin America, and then expanded to the rest of the world. So as of today, we're in 250 countries and territories, and have three 50 million businesses in our database. That's
Cool, cool, good to know. Awesome. Yeah. So a little bit you know about about DataBlock and our journey.

S Speaker 17:01incredible skill. Jeff, thanks a lot for the overview. That's pretty interesting. How do you sort of come up at that bigger disparity between the accuracy for data plot and a lot of other competitors? How is that operating? Is this specifically because other don't have feet on the ground in some of these more international markets? Is it just because of that, or No,

S Speaker 27:25I think our mode is we started with the hardest problems first, right? We started International, and had to build up the database. And we started in one country, and then went to two, then went to three. We were only in like two countries until like 2022, so like, it shows like how hard it was. And then we got velocity and scale, but you got to go through every single available a government website in Mexico is different than the government website in Brazil, right? And so there's so many intricacies that we figured out and that we solved for when everybody else focuses mostly on the United States, all of our competitors focus on the United States, right? And we decided, let's go after the hardest problems first, because they would take more time. But now we're global, including in the United

S Speaker 18:10States, that's very interesting job. So I haven't taken a look at a lot of competitors. Maybe I've gone through a couple of websites, and they seem similar in positioning. Would you say the market is really this fragmented in the sense that a lot of these players aren't really targeting international markets very significantly. And I would, I'm surprised because of that, because a lot of your clients, I would assume, are multinational corporations, so they have a lot of value for global data sets as well.

S Speaker 28:42Yeah, you know, I think it's just our competitors, like a place or AI, a safe graph, they're just really trying to compete in the United States. There's a lot of money to be made in just the United States, right? But, you know, eventually, maybe they'll want to go global. But they haven't made really any moves yet, because it's too difficult and it's so competitive in the US that they're having to always watch their back as well.

S Speaker 19:08Very interesting. So can you speak a little bit more about sort of the AI models you mentioned earlier, you mentioned you have localized them to specific countries and government websites like you mentioned differ in different places, so you had to localize your models. How does the entire architecture work, and what does the models take care of? And sort of just with the models, what accuracy do you reach, and then with human in the loop, what is the final accuracy that you sort of come out with your data sets? Yeah,
Very interesting.

And sort of just with the models, what accuracy do you reach, and then with human in the loop, what is the final accuracy that you sort of come out with your data sets? Yeah,
S Speaker 110:23got it. And you mentioned multiple attributes, multiple data sources, and humans making the final decisions. Can you expand that a little bit? What kind of attribute, what kind of data sources Are you tapping into? Are those public data sources? If so, where does the I would say long term mode really comes in. Can someone else come in and create an far superior ML model and sort of get that data set running pretty soon?

S Speaker 210:53Yeah, so AI models come to us for the data. Llms come to us for the data, because the data is so hard to get. You can't just create AI chat bots or AI agents to go get this data, because each source is so different, right? And it just takes so much time to build it up. There's also language differences, right? Going from Mexico to Chile, there's difference in Chilean Spanish versus Mexican Spanish. There's differences in addressing so all of that together creates a really difficult challenge, right? And that's ultimately what we have to do is go after all of those publicly available sources, and find them, and they open it, the sources can close down, right? They may not be good, and you're always having to update it as well. And that's a part of like our boat, is that we're really focused on that international piece. Got

They may not be good, and you're always having to update it as well. And that's a part of like our boat, is that we're really focused on that international piece. Got
Yeah, so AI models come to us for the data. Llms come to us for the data, because the data is so hard to get. You can't just create AI chat bots or AI agents to go get this data, because each source is so different, right? And it just takes so much time to build it up. There's also language differences, right? Going from Mexico to Chile, there's difference in Chilean Spanish versus Mexican Spanish. There's differences in addressing so all of that together creates a really difficult challenge, right? And that's ultimately what we have to do is go after all of those publicly available sources, and find them, and they open it, the sources can close down, right? They may not be good, and you're always having to update it as well. And that's a part of like our boat, is that we're really focused on that international piece. Got
S Speaker 111:38it, got it. And I Mike had mentioned some of your top level business metrics, I saw about a 90% gross margin there. How's that? That spectacular gross margin, considering you also have a lot of human in the loop, and gig workers working for you, how are you able to sort of achieve that? Yeah, we don't
it, got it. And I Mike had mentioned some of your top level business metrics, I saw about a 90% gross margin there. How's that?

S Speaker 211:59have that many humans anymore. We used to have, you know, a lot more. Now we only have 30 something contractors. That's it
have that many humans anymore. We used to have, you know, a lot more. Now we only have 30 something contractors. That's it

S Speaker 112:07pretty amazing. Based overseas, 30 contractors, and they, I would assume they're distributed between different countries that you're focusing on. So Correct? Yeah, got it. And let's say, How would a workflow for some of these contractors be? To what extent does, let's say, an ML model, give you data points, and What decisions do these contractors then eventually make?
pretty amazing. Based overseas, 30 contractors, and they, I would assume they're distributed between different countries that you're focusing on. So Correct? Yeah, got it.

S Speaker 212:30Yeah, it'd be like, if we get one source that says it's Jim's cafe, 123, Main Street, and we're like, pretty sure it's good. But then another source says Jim's cafeteria, 125, Main Street, and they're both good sources, and it's an edge case, that's what then our contractor will go in, look at that data and be like it's actually Jim's cafeteria. This is the right one. Our AI can do most of it, but there are edge cases that come up that our humans have to sit there in front of the computer
Yeah, it'd be like, if we get one source that says it's Jim's cafe, 123, Main Street, and we're like, pretty sure it's good.

S Speaker 113:07absolutely, absolutely. And so far, let's say, for example, we take the case of Mexico. What are the data sources? Are you tapping into to create your final database today? Yeah,
absolutely, absolutely. And so far, let's say, for example, we take the case of Mexico. What are the data sources? Are you tapping into to create your final database today? Yeah,

absolutely, absolutely. And so far, let's say, for example, we take the case of Mexico. What are the data sources? Are you tapping into to create your final database today? Yeah,
S Speaker 213:18so Mexican like the main government database, and then we'll do like the Mexico City databases, the Guadalajara databases, the Monterey databases. So we'll go to city level or county level. We then have all the store locators, so any Starbucks, McDonald's, etc, that operates in Mexico, we'll take all those down. And then, like the yellow pages of Mexico, the trip advisors of Mexico, whatever those are, what are that? Are crowd sourced? We'll take all those down as well, and they're usually all focused on Mexico, right? And then we merge batch
so Mexican like the main government database, and then we'll do like the Mexico City databases, the Guadalajara databases, the Monterey databases. So we'll go to city level or county level.

S Speaker 113:52and interesting. So, yeah, that's that's interesting. I guess I have a initial sense. How do you price some of these data sources? Do you sell raw data. Do you have a dashboard on top of it? We
and interesting. So, yeah, that's that's interesting. I guess I have a initial sense. How do you price some of these data sources? Do you sell raw data. Do you have a dashboard on top of it? We

S Speaker 115:29interesting, so it's, it's for the final retail distribution and strategy. Interesting. Do many of these are? Most of these are, or do you see a specific kind of industry, or focus on a specific kind of customer in your customer base, is it? Is it focused on a specific set of industries, anything like that? FMCG, manufacturing, things like that?

S Speaker 215:59Yeah. I'd say mapping and search are big. So think of like, you know, the Ubers of the world. Like, you know, anyone who cares about, you know, search and mapping and third party logistics, there's then CPGs, right? So CPGs care about it. For sales and marketing, market penetration, etc. Real estate is pretty big for us. So for site selection, being able to see how you know competitors are performing, etc. And then we just started to sell into hedge funds, because we can tell, six months before the 10k or 10 Q come out, how many Starbucks opened and closed globally
Yeah. I'd say mapping and search are big. So think of like, you know, the Ubers of the world.

S Speaker 116:37got it. And even for hedge funds, even for site selection, your sort of delivery ends with the raw data files, and then the entire analytics layer on top of it is for the end customer. Yep. Internally. Interesting, interesting. Got it you mentioned you have reached 10 million in error. How? What kind of growth are you looking for in 2025
got it. And even for hedge funds, even for site selection, your sort of delivery ends with the raw data files, and then the entire analytics layer on top of it is for the end customer. Yep.

S Speaker 117:06doubling the revenue. That's interesting. That's the goal. And what part of sort of, let's say the additional 10 million would come in from existing customers. What? How much of it would be new logos?
doubling the revenue. That's interesting. That's the goal. And what part of sort of, let's say the additional 10 million would come in from existing customers. What? How much of it would be new logos?
