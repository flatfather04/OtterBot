S Speaker 10:00Last year, and within a few months time, signed seven enterprise customers, including Salesforce. We have over $8 million in our enterprise pipeline, and eight additional deals in red lines. And the best part, all of this was made possible with less than $1 million in funding businesses. Businesses rely on expensive and outdated market research methods to understand their customers, spending billions of dollars, and they're still getting it wrong for the first time, AI makes it possible to collect richer feedback and generate important insights on demand using generates conversational AI agent businesses can conduct qualitative interviews at a quantitative scale, unlocking customer centricity and understanding at unprecedented speed and scale as a team, Geno is uniquely positioned to win this race. We are bringing together over 40 years of technological know how in the field of conversational AI from elite intelligence units at the Israeli intelligence Corp, combined with hands on experience in enterprise go to market. Genoa has an extremely hairy goal ahead of it. We want to disrupt a two decades old industry dominated by Qualtrics and Medallia. We're going to do that by building an AI first customer experience platform where Gen we come talk to us if you want to learn about the next deals to get signed. Thank you.

S Speaker 34:39Mara we're building Universal Basic air defense. Cheap drones are the number one cause of losses in modern combat. These drones kill ten million tanks. They fly in coordinated groups to attack, and they're immune to signal jam. This isn't just a Ukrainian. Problem right now, our enemies can build 20 drones for just 20 grand and causing massive national tragedy, no currently fielded system can stop this, introducing spike, fully autonomous air defense that costs less than a car. Spike is a two part system. Spotter tracks dozens of incoming targets and seekers launch autonomously to intercept up to 48 drums at once. Two Ukrainian brigades are ready to spend 10 million to protect their 10,000 troops from the number one threat to their lives as soon as possible. Here's what we've built so far. You

S Speaker 59:24Hi friends. My name is COVID CEO and founder of sunflower. We are building an AI enable toolkit to keep you sober for the 1.2 billion humans that struggle with addiction. Sunflower is on a mission to create 1 billion day sober, one day at a time. So previously, I was a growth exec at Rupa, where I started as the very first GTM hire, before growing us from 5 million to $75 million a year in annualized lab sales by increasing our user acquisition by over 4,000% I'm uniquely talented at building products and then taking them to massive scale.

S Speaker 510:03One of the biggest problems within addiction is the fact that there's not enough therapists to properly meet the demand of this market because of AI. For the first time, we're finally able to build an infinitely scalable solution that actually keeps you sober. We combine visual progression tracking and AI sponsor in CBT based therapy exercises. Patty is a 62 year grandmother who has been an alcoholic for over 30 years. Her kids don't like her very much because she's the alcoholic mom and she's been villainized by society, and she is unimaginably lonely and isolated, Sam is the first entity that has made her feel validated in over a decade because of sunflower patty is 32 days over. This is 23,000 monthly active patties. We have been consistently growing over 100% month over month over month over month for the last four months in a row. Our goal is to get 1 million monthly active users by the end of this year and become one of the fastest growing health and fitness apps of all time. We are building a product that touches people in the darkest moments of their lives. It's not just an app our users love. It is the most important app they have on their phone. We're going to build the world's greatest solution to addiction and then put it into the hands of billing people. If this is a

It's faster and more intuitive, and honestly, it's a better way to work. And our design partners agree. Some of them observe that it's like Canva and Pixar combined. Now we're currently in beta. We're planning a public launch in June. We have about 2 million in ARR already built up in our pipeline. 1000s of people are signed up, and we have some of the world's largest companies

We launched in July, and we're already achieving over 1.5 million in monthly net revenue, the 30% month over month kicker, with a three to one LCD CAC ratio and an eight to 10 week payback period. This is allowing us to grow faster. Our Da use and torment guarantees are growing every day, which is allowing us to capture network effects and further bolster our growth and retention. We have a proven team who have done this before, successfully, myself and Jeff Kaplan, we ran pen interactive, and brought it from zero to 700 million in revenue and turned it profitable in a highly regulated industry. Sean Hurley, he ran drafting sports book from the CEO of Flynn and Nick Sherry our CTO, he built and he sold absolute games, a successful social casino, our team knows how to win.

We've only been building for two months, but we've already closed 400k in contracts, and people can't wait to talk to us. Social media is the fastest growing sector in marketing, and 80% of Fortune 500 companies work with influencers, many of them with 1000s. But monetization is a nightmare to scale, and jobs like talent, coordinator and manager are burgeoning to support monetization streams like affiliates, commerce and influencer marketing. Influencer marketing is a great business where campaigns can be worth millions, but it's highly manual and dependent on people. Behind

S Speaker 1121:25Hi everyone. I'm Mustafa from circle games, and we are creating genre defining tribal games. Our story began 10 years ago in college, where four friends dreamed of creating world class mobile games. Knowing dreams need foundations. We split up to join industry giants like Zynga dream and Bucha games. We led teams in companies generating over $5 billion and content. Now we are back together, combining these expertise with our original passion in mobile gaming. We know the secret. We know how to build huge successes because we have spotted a clear pattern. As markets mature, players demand higher quality games. The teams that met these expectations unlock billion dollar opportunities like Tomb blast in blast category and match factory in the match now. Sort is the fastest growing genre and is ready for its next evolution, and that's where circle game steps in. We identified highway gaucik mechanics in rapidly growing but under sort markets elevate them through flawless execution and powerful innovations, then launch swiftly to dominate the market. That's how we created sort Express. Sort Express was developed in just two and a half months by our stellar team of five powered by AI tools integrated into our creative and development workflows. Early metrics validate this approach, more than 45% pay more attention with a flat score 70 minutes of playtime, and double the conversion rate against our competitors, those metrics demonstrate our strong entrance into $12 billion casual puzzle market. By applying this formula across categories, we are positioned to become the next billion dollar mobile gaming company VR circle games join

S Speaker 1432:26Hi. My name is Martin Lu. I'm the co founder and CEO of ECR. At ECR, we believe that sweepstakes is a solution to bring real money engagement into the world of free to play, and we're building the solution in two clear steps. First, we're building the next generation of social sweepstakes Casino. Current market leaders have grown to scale, relying mostly on aggressive UA while neglecting product innovation and cruising on the easy monetization offered by real money. And in this gap, we see a clear opportunity to deliver a fresh, personalized product experience that is uniquely designed for the slot enthusiasts in the US market. Our team is purpose built for this. Our funding team built Betty gaming, a regulated online casino founded by my co founder, Justin Park, scaling to 120 million ARR in under two years by focusing exclusively on slots. And we're now combining this deep, real money gaming expertise with season operators from free to play and even sweepstakes. And that isn't enough. We're accelerating our roadmap even further by leveraging the IP and technology of study gaming so that from day one, we're able to go to market with a robust, proven online casino product. And all of this brings us to our second step in which is the end vision for Edgar. Edgar is building a sweepstakes platform to introduce real money engagement to not only social casinos, but across every free to play gaming category, because we believe injecting the thrill of real money can introduce new forms of game engagement, but also expand strategies into acquisition, monetization and even distribution and a winning social speech casino is the perfect and necessary starting

S Speaker 1944:48I'm Riley, the founder of Kip ash, and we're on a mission to Unlock The Game Dev in everyone i. I spent the last decade building some of the most passionate communities in the industry. In 2012 I co founded roll 20, the largest platform for playing D and D online. In 2016 I created Orbis VR, the first NMO built for room scale. VR, both of these projects started with grassroots Kickstarter campaigns, and combined, they generated over 400 million in lifetime revenue across more than 18 million users. Now I'm on a mission to democratize Game Dev for everyone, so creators of all skill levels can bring their vision to life. The gaming audience is massive, but the barrier to creating games is still far too high. Kip bashes are new, easy to use platform for creating 2d games in any genre. It combines everything you need with an all in one tool kit for making games, along with an AI assistant to walk you through every step of the process. Most importantly, with kit bash, you can create games that look polished and are actually compelling and fun to play. AI is a big part of what makes this possible. We built kit bash from the ground up to be aI native, and we're already using it today to create games. Here's a quick walk through showing the process of me making a boss fight. As you can see, a short prompt is all it takes, and then I can just play test the result. If your social feeds been blowing up recently about five coding that's exactly what this is. By embracing this prompt play and tweak cycle, we can make it easy for anyone to create cool games to prove out the power of Kip bash. We're building wildland, a 2d bullet held MMO targeted at an audience we've identified that's more than 10 million strong. We launched our demo on Steam two weeks ago, and we're already seeing strong initial signals peaking in the top 10 of the new and trending list. Wild land not only gives us the opportunity to dog food our platform, it lets us introduce an audience of players to our Creator tools to turn them into kit bash, users of the future,

S Speaker 2653:31Hi. My name is TK, founder and CEO of specter games. Specter is a new type of game publisher, blending web two, web three features to supercharge gaming for the mainstream audience. I'm excited telling you the story behind Specter. I'm a senior entrepreneur with 20 years experience in the game industry. I raised over $100 million in capital from top GVCS. Founded and exited multiple startups with nine figure outcomes. My last setup anyway was acquired by invoca brands, where I stayed on for three years. During those three years, we went all in on web three. We anabolic brands invested and acquired over 250 web three projects, and I learned firsthand how web three can supercharge retention monetization. None of those web three games were able to reach mainstream gamers, first because of the onboarding friction, and second, due to the web three incentive designs taking the fun out of the games. I'll talk about both. But first, how can we use friction to scale to mainstream gamers? That's where telegram comes in. Telegram has almost a billion monthly active users, namely, quite reluctant features that allow us to model our game directly inside telegram. This reduces friction and distribution.

S Speaker 2754:59to solve the second issue, we're launching full feature web, two games on Telegram, starting with high quality roguelike games. Our first game spectrum agency features top tier gameplay that satisfy the traditional gamers while keeping the web three features passive and seamless. But what does it mean to have passive directory features? Well, this is our playbook. We allow our players to earn tokens in the background, when when they're not even playing, and when they level up in the game and do all of the game, they get even more. Their weight of earning goes up. You also get tokens when you invite friends, and if those friends that you invited do all of the game and they level up, then you get more tokens. This allows us to add the powerful but three incentive layer without breaking the game for the traditional gamers, we're a new type of Publisher, optimized with Saturday super apps. Our token spec will be the brand behind our publishing that will unite a powerful community behind all of our games. The gaming industry is massive, and the opportunity to blend web few and web three the right way can be absolutely explosive. We have the right team to do this. We are super excited to lead through revolution. Thank you. Applause.

After we take Coronado, we'll conquer the rest of San Diego. Then by the end of the year, it's five more military cities. Once valor becomes the nationwide standard for businesses to support those who serve, we'll bring all these transactions in network by issuing valor cars. This is just the first step towards building a full suite of financial products for our military community. At valor, our team knows what it means to scale and serve. I led growth at Poly market, and my teammates are veterans who led marketing at USAA, topped on Maverick and sold over 40 million in real estate for military families. Look, I don't give a shit about anyone's political beliefs, but the one thing I know every single person in this room can get behind is supporting those who sacrifice everything for us.

AI is amazing, but the problem today is that it's built for well, nerds, your average person doesn't care what models being used, what rules are, and they definitely don't have the patience to navigate discord, slash brands, complex UI or today's fragmented market.

S Speaker 301:07:09everyday creators tomorrow. And that's exactly what we're doing at blank we've made it as easy as going into blanks to create with AI. We've made it social, putting creations into a feed with likes, comments and follows, and we've aggregated the best of AI from images to animations to interactive voice. So that's all in one place, all just a few taps away. That's what AI for the masses looks like and people in our data are loving it. While in stealth, we've grown to over 4000 daily active users. Our D 30 retention is at 30% our super users are spending over 80 minutes per day across four sessions. And what's most inspiring to us is that nearly half of our users have never created with AI before, meaning we're expanding the market and unlocking a new generation of creators as multiple time founders with deep expertise in social AI and go to market. We're the perfect team to build this. I've built and scaled communities to millions of millions in revenues. Shelter has built mobile games that have scaled to millions of players, and Danielle has made content that has reached and inspired millions of people.

It's like plaid for behavioral data, where basically we provide an embedded component for your application, where you can embed and your users can link their consumer accounts to your application. And we've seen some really powerful use cases emerge from that. So for example, we can mimic this use case. This is Delta. Delta's diamond Medallion Program has a CAC in the upper five digits, and so they partner with companies like Uber in order to understand where you live, how often you travel, what kind of hotels you stay at, that sort of thing. And that's powerful use case. Other airlines and travel companies don't have the same luxury, but with our API, they can embed the same exact capabilities. Without that Uber partnership, this is only possible now thanks to data portability, basically on the last bullet point of all the data privacy acts you see is something called data portability. It's your right to access your data, import it from one service to another. Most people don't know about it, but I think it's one of the most powerful things in this generation. The last thing I would like to say is that startups also kind of sucked. This bit is hard, so I appreciate all of you for being in the business of supporting underdogs. I think it's quite a noble thing. Thank you very much.
