S Speaker 10:23Pretty good. Pretty good. Thanks. How are you doing? Well,
Pretty good. Pretty good. Thanks. How are you doing? Well,
Pretty good. Pretty good. Thanks. How are you doing? Well,
Pretty good. Pretty good. Thanks. How are you doing? Well,
S Speaker 20:26well, crazy these days, but I guess that's some
0:34some good, some bad. It's the roller coaster, right? Absolutely.
some good, some bad. It's the roller coaster, right? Absolutely.

0:37So are you based in San Francisco? Yeah, yeah, oh,
2:40don't know, pick your poison and tell them, hey, this
don't know, pick your poison and tell them, hey, this
don't know, pick your poison and tell them, hey, this
don't know, pick your poison and tell them, hey, this
S Speaker 22:43is what's trending. This is what's going on. This is you what's what's happening in the world of social video. But I'd say, like, the fundamental technology that we are building and working on is bigger than just social listening and social video. It's about just understanding video. And we actually are in the middle of right now, kind of trying to figure out, how do we take this technology to new markets outside of just the social listening space.

S Speaker 13:05Got it, that's so that's a great overview. Chelsea, thanks for that. Would you be able to tell me a little bit more? Little bit more about the tech stack itself? You mentioned you've developed some proprietary models. How are you thinking about that? And then we can deep dive on the video and analytics market as well. I'm sure that's that's we have seen some good companies getting funded in that space very recently. It's a big market, lots of value creation opportunity right now. So would love to understand what you're thinking about there as well later on.

S Speaker 23:34Yeah. I mean, like, if you think about our proprietary tech and the way it works, we have not developed an LLM, yeah, we're just a lot of algorithms that we can, like, host and store, and we're not creating video. It's all about understanding video. So you input a video into our system, and again, today, that's like a tick tock video that we're creating an API so other videos can go in, and we just break it down. So, hey, what's the audio in the audio transcript? What are the objects on screen? What's
Yeah. I mean, like, if you think about our proprietary tech and the way it works, we have not developed an LLM, yeah, we're just a lot of algorithms that we can, like, host and store, and we're not creating video.

So, hey, what's the audio in the audio transcript? What are the objects on screen? What's
S Speaker 24:01is this a cat or a dog or a bicycle, whatever? Yeah. So we annotate, understand that we capture, like, all of that metadata from within a video. That's kind of step one is just like, here's the metadata when we consider our technology in the way it works. So the big thing that we're doing is really starting to make associations and understand like, okay, so their tone of voice was angry at the same time the cat was on screen. So does that context mean that they're like, angry at the cat? So that's sort of the next layer of understanding that goes on top of that is like, okay, here we have all the metadata. Now let's start to put them together within our tool. Kind of smoke the end. We sell this as A, B to B, SAS product right now. And we sell like dashboards and interfaces. We have search abilities, we store videos. We have the ability to use generative AI to summarize what's happening in a video or multiple videos. So yeah, what you'd expect, it's just understanding videos. Fair
is this a cat or a dog or a bicycle, whatever? Yeah. So we annotate, understand that we capture, like, all of that metadata from within a video.

So yeah, what you'd expect, it's just understanding videos. Fair
S Speaker 14:58enough. Fair enough for for you to sort of capture those metadata. Are you currently using off the shelf models for text to speech, speech to text, audio transcription, object recognition, things like that.

S Speaker 25:13Yeah, almost everything is now in house. But for the really, really basic stuff, it is off the shelf. So if it's like text, just grabbing text like, we don't need our own model for that. So some of the things we've created in house, in our proprietary and some of the things we just use, like, basic, off the shelf, open source models and in terms
Yeah, almost everything is now in house. But for the really, really basic stuff, it is off the shelf. So if it's like text, just grabbing text like, we don't need our own model for that.

S Speaker 15:39right, right. That makes sense. Of course, you don't need to build something or just get the entire thing rolling all, all the way. I get that in terms of making associations between these different forms of metadata. What's, what's the approach? There's

S Speaker 26:00not rockets. It's like, kind of using some human understanding things like, like I said, if my tone of voice is angry when there's a cat walking onto the screen, can I assume that I migrate the cat. It's sort of a you look at a video, it has time, it has different elements. Different elements have meaning. And you have to assign meaning and values to each of those things to

S Speaker 16:24Understood, understood. And tell me if I'm it's if it's fair to assume that right now, you have been training your models on a lot of social media data. Do you think you would see emergent properties for the same models to be applicable on all forms of video content?
Understood, understood. And tell me if I'm it's if it's fair to assume that right now, you have been training your models on a lot of social media data. Do you think you would see emergent properties for the same models to be applicable on all forms of video content?

S Speaker 26:40Yeah, absolutely. I think social video does have unique elements, right? Maybe it's faster, it's funny, entertaining, but that being said, I would say social video really captures the broad spectrum of human things. And it's cool because it's over across the whole entire world. So we have a global company. It's working across, I think, right now we're over like 70 languages. We have, like, some data sets focused on the Middle East and things like that. And yeah, we capture, we have news data, we have silly data. Social is really cool, because it's such a rich way to understand so many types of like people and topics and things.
Yeah, absolutely. I think social video does have unique elements, right?

S Speaker 17:22Absolutely I agree. We have been coming across a lot of new foundation model companies, and the first layer of data that they want to train on is social, because it gives them an access to a variety of situations. So I totally agree with what you're saying. That's also you
Absolutely I agree. We have been coming across a lot of new foundation model companies, and the first layer of data that they want to train on is social, because it gives them an access to a variety of situations. So I totally agree with what you're saying. That's also you

S Speaker 27:34should connect us with them in the future, because that we are sitting on top of quite a bit of process and understood social data. So there's, there's something very rich there,
should connect us with them in the future, because that we are sitting on top of quite a bit of process and understood social data. So there's, there's something very rich there,
should connect us with them in the future, because that we are sitting on top of quite a bit of process and understood social data. So there's, there's something very rich there,
should connect us with them in the future, because that we are sitting on top of quite a bit of process and understood social data. So there's, there's something very rich there,
S Speaker 17:42for sure. Yeah, hopefully there will be a few connections that I can make over there. I do see some synergies, for sure. That's very interesting. Chelsea, how's the business doing right now? Why are you planning to shift to other or expand as such? And how's the social media front of things going on?
for sure. Yeah, hopefully there will be a few connections that I can make over there. I do see some synergies, for sure. That's very interesting. Chelsea, how's the business doing right now?

S Speaker 27:58Yeah, so social media and social listening is good. Business is great. And again, great is greatest. Relative, they're doing about $100,000 a month in revenue right now. We've done over a million dollars in revenue. The business is moving. That being said, it's just like the industry of social listening, I think is, like, only so big, right? It's so we're we're growing. It's fine, like, it's not bad. I've got a great business here. But that being said, video understanding just has so many more applications and things like that. So that's why, I think, for as a seed stage company, yeah, we've we've developed technology, we built a team, we've established presence. We're stable, you know, we spend money, but we make money. And I think it's just time now to say, Okay, we've built this foundational technology is powerful. It has so many more use cases. Let's look to this is a very, very big company and important technology, and it's time to take over the world with it. So
Yeah, so social media and social listening is good. Business is great. And again, great is greatest. Relative, they're doing about $100,000 a month in revenue right now. We've done over a million dollars in revenue. The business is moving. That being said, it's just like the industry of social listening, I think is, like, only so big, right?

Let's look to this is a very, very big company and important technology, and it's time to take over the world with it. So
S Speaker 18:57yeah, the times now what? What use cases are you thinking about expanding more recently than later?
yeah, the times now what? What use cases are you thinking about expanding more recently than later?
yeah, the times now what? What use cases are you thinking about expanding more recently than later?
yeah, the times now what? What use cases are you thinking about expanding more recently than later?
S Speaker 29:03Yeah, that's a good question, and it's, frankly, something I'm really in the middle of understanding right now. So my expectation is that we will look to raise our Series A probably in the spring or before summer of next year. I would hope Yes, and we have not expanded outside of our social listening market yet. So I'm in a phase right now where I'm just like having calls with tons of customers, customer discovery, learning, trying to sell, looking for Lois.
Yeah, that's a good question, and it's, frankly, something I'm really in the middle of understanding right now.

S Speaker 29:44haven't cracked it yet, but I am watching, like other big media processing companies, like 12 labs, for instance, if you're familiar with them, and going, we do the same thing. So we should, we should hurry up and accelerate our go to market in those areas. We have been approached by quite a few llms Just looking for data, yeah, and there's definitely, we haven't done that yet, and we have not engaged with any but I am very interested in setting up some of the LLM market with our technology so that they can ingest video data in a powerful way that, you know, fuels their algorithms. Interesting,
haven't cracked it yet, but I am watching, like other big media processing companies, like 12 labs, for instance, if you're familiar with them, and going, we do the same thing.

We have been approached by quite a few llms Just looking for data, yeah, and there's definitely, we haven't done that yet, and we have not engaged with any but I am very interested in setting up some of the LLM market with our technology so that they can ingest video data in a powerful way that, you know, fuels their algorithms. Interesting,

Interesting,
S Speaker 110:22would you be at the liberty of sharing a little bit more here? It's very curious. What? What's interesting for an LLM play, and what kind of data points could you supply to them? I mean, like, you
would you be at the liberty of sharing a little bit more here? It's very curious. What? What's interesting for an LLM play, and what kind of data points could you supply to them? I mean, like, you

S Speaker 210:38know, it's again, like looking at your portfolio. Now, you guys have a big LLM tonight. So think about, like, data acquisition for an LLM, right. Data is king. You need to like, Eat as much data as possible, to like fill your models and understanding. And you eat all the text data in the internet, and then what, right? And if you look out at the world, and if you want to understand people, how people think, what people are doing, video is such a rich source of just like how humans work, how we interact, what we're saying, meaning. So there is just this gold mine of data sitting stuck in video right now that llms haven't tapped into the full richness of so what viral moment can do is empower llms to unlock how rich video is, so that they can

S Speaker 111:31that makes sense. I'm sure you would have come across a lot of physical AI foundation models. More recently, you would see a lot of robotic companies developing their own foundation models. And we have come across some of them. They could be some of the perfect ICP for you in this specific aspect of things, they are building foundation model for the physical world. And hence, video is the first level of perceptive understanding they want to get. And hence, I don't feel that there's a lot of synergy there. Hopefully down the line, I see there might be a potential few companies that we can connect you to that's very interesting. Chelsea, so you mentioned you're planning to raise sometime quarter two next year. What's the milestone that you plan to hit till then? And what kind of Yeah, well, like I said, we've

S Speaker 212:22done over a million, not yet 2 million in revenue in our social listening space, which is fine, but I have high expectations that we can demonstrate traction in with our video model capabilities, outside of our social listening market. And that would be what I would look to raise my series A on. So I would say I don't necessarily need to like crack the market, but did be, you know, demonstrate that there, whether it's a few contracts, some loi, something that is significantly indicative that we're off to the races and growing as a video, understanding model,

S Speaker 113:01fair, fair. That's interesting. Any any expectations on revenue metrics that you want to hit till then.
fair, fair. That's interesting. Any any expectations on revenue metrics that you want to hit till then.
fair, fair. That's interesting. Any any expectations on revenue metrics that you want to hit till then.
fair, fair. That's interesting. Any any expectations on revenue metrics that you want to hit till then.
S Speaker 213:11Very frankly, I don't have that set yet. I don't think the value is in the revenue so much as just demonstrating that this has value as video understanding and how big that market really is. So some revenue like, again, I want traction, but I don't think I need like that, like month over month growth spike, yet it's just demonstrating we're here.
Very frankly, I don't have that set yet. I don't think the value is in the revenue so much as just demonstrating that this has value as video understanding and how big that market really is.

S Speaker 113:33Fair enough. Fair enough. That's that's exciting. Coming back to what you have today, what level of virality Are you able to sort of identify, I can imagine, you have metadata, and you're able to sort of make connections between different forms of metadata is, are the customers really getting value out of it? Do you really see them finding things that they could not have found otherwise? Yeah, certainly.
Fair enough. Fair enough. That's that's exciting.

S Speaker 214:00And it's not necessarily about virality, per se. I know viral moments are named. It's more just about, what are people saying about so, like, McDonald's has used our data, because people are boycotting McDonald's right now due to, like, some of their support in the Middle East, and they don't understand the conversation. They're like, how big is it? Who's talking about it? Who's talking about us? So it's just very valuable to them. It's not necessarily around like, Oh, this is a XYZ level virality or, yeah, it's any visibility and measurement to be able to say this is happening around their brand. This is valuable. It's happening in video. You wouldn't otherwise be able to know it, measure it, see it, and now it's crystal clear. So more than like, a virality metric, which is something you provide the real value and job to be done that we give to our customers is data intelligence and the ability to understand what's actually happening out there in video at all, which they otherwise wouldn't know,
And it's not necessarily about virality, per se. I know viral moments are named.

S Speaker 115:05Right? And so I'm assuming here that the current big players in this space, like brand watch proud social they have social listening, but they cannot tap into the video modality of things. And so in that space, do you see yourself selling in parallel to some of these companies? Do you see yourself as a technology provider to some of these companies? That's
Right? And so I'm assuming here that the current big players in this space, like brand watch proud social they have social listening, but they cannot tap into the video modality of things.

S Speaker 215:27a good question. That's actually what we're figuring out right now. So we've explored a world where we, right now, are kind of a competitive solution, or may not competitive, but like people will have Sprout Social and us right because we just fill a goal hole or a gap at the end of the day. That being said, as we pivot and move into being a video processing and understanding company, I would see a world where we could be a technology provider for these companies who were considering competitors right now,
a good question. That's actually what we're figuring out right now.
