S Speaker 21:02Ben, I have a background of working with startups. I've worked with several early stage ventures across different industries, FinTech, social media, edtech, e mobility, to name a few. And my roles were across product, branding, growth, fundraising. I recently, I guess two years back, pivoted into venture. I have worked with Morpheus ventures and Menlo Ventures in the past, and currently am working with Qualcomm ventures for over eight months or so as a senior associate here, I personally focus on AI infrastructure and agents and any or any sort of vertical AI applications, or for that matter. But to take you through the funds focus, I guess we have a quite a broad focus, sort of independent from Qualcomm, as in a sense, we invest in AI. We have had good investments in the infrastructure layer. We are more keenly looking towards the application layer. Now in infrastructure, we have anthropic weights and biases, kl, AI, to name a few. But now the focus is more on applications for the team here, we parallelly also invest in AR, VR, IoT, industrial automation, any sort of SaaS which interfaces with industries, manufacturing, automobile tech stack, like broadly speaking, if you can imagine there is a degree of compute and connectivity involved, Qualcomm ventures would be interested in that we Are check sizes are typically from 2 million to ten million we are a Series A investor, preferably, but at times, we do see it more often now, given the entire AI valuation rise and but our seed is more of an opportunistic strategy than, let's say, a threesist driven strategy for and the team. Team we have. Our team is based out of the bay area. We have some members in San Diego. It's a global fund. So we also have offices in LATAM, China, Israel, India, in the US investment scene. We aim to deploy somewhere between 150 $280 million a year. So right now, currently, actively deploying capital,

S Speaker 23:24that's correct, and it's basically because of our check sizes. We anything shorter than a 2 million check size wouldn't really move the needle for us, given it's a corporate venture fund, we do have to involve some of our legal and compliance practices, so that becomes a hindrance. But always happy to take a look at seed investments. Sometimes we do see we have done some seed investments this year, so it's not a strategy, but we if it's in good opportunity, we will do it. That's probably
that's correct, and it's basically because of our check sizes.

That's probably
3:53not a match made in heaven, but let's see, right?
S Speaker 13:57Because we're raising our seed round, three to three and a half million total size.
Because we're raising our seed round, three to three and a half million total size.

Because we're raising our seed round, three to three and a half million total size.
S Speaker 14:07I'm born in Belgium, currently live in NSF, moved here because of the YC batch, and we're basically application layer AI in the market research space, right? Which is one of those verticals where there is a already fairly cool match between what Gen AI is capable of and what is necessary today, like the future, if you assume what underlying financial model technology is going to look like in the next 1234, years, it's going to be like totally disrupted by it, especially qualitative research. So I'm very much looking forward to that. What do we do? But maybe better myself? Prior to this, I work at McKinsey for five years in their private equity and venture capital practice, predominantly working on software intent deals. So I've seen the space move. I've seen what AI is doing in the space, and I saw how, for many sectors and industries it's it's a scary beast that they don't know what it will do with them. One of the biggest ones, I was part, and this is all public info. I was part of a merger in the market research base, where you have Nielsen, which got delisted into niq and merged with a German market research company. And I've worked on that deal for over a year, and I saw a incredibly incumbency driven slowly innovating anticape industry. And then there's Gen AI, which has such a great match with that vertical. So what are we doing? Companies constantly have to make decisions across teams, marketing teams, brand teams, product teams. What do they do if they want to make decisions? Like in many companies, there's a certain user centricity, customer centricity, baked into the DNA of the company. So they want you to talk to your user, to talk to your customer, to drive to drive many decisions. Currently it's super tough to do that. You can go for like, quick, superficial, quantitative research. You can run a survey. You can get some responses, and Likert scale questions on multiple choice questions. It it does the job in certain use cases. It's sometimes force fitted into something where they actually want to dig a bit deeper. Yeah, but it's it doesn't give you depth at all. Then you have the other end of the spectrum of research, in the traditional quality and research, where you actually talk to people. You do user interviews, you do consumer interviews, you organized focus groups, you talk to them, you have a moderator, which based on a discussion guide, we'll talk to them, dig a bit deeper here and there, and we'll then synthesize everything that they learned. The second bit, so traditional qualitative research, if you will, is, pardon my language, a total shit show. It is very annoying to do. It's super manual, labor intensive as such, super expensive. Companies want to do it, but are oftentimes annoyed by it because it takes so much time, it takes so much effort, it takes so much money, and it's fantastic. How great a match it is with with AI technology, right? And so, what have we built? We build a platform that will automate your entire research flow. I can give me a second. I always find it nice to explain in the right tool while actually showing it on screen, sure? So

I always find it nice to explain in the right tool while actually showing it on screen, sure? So
S Speaker 17:40We basically automated the entire market, qualitative market research flow with with a platform leveraging AI. AI will will be supporting you across the different stages. How does the flow normally work? You create a study. You create a new research project. You can do it. You fill out a few things. Let's say a sing, a VC interview. It's a stupid topic, right? But

S Speaker 18:09you can fill out a few other things. What language do you want your respondents to respond in? Etc. You can like the tone of the interviewer. You can play around with it, yeah. Next step is your research, objective, general understanding of vendor capital interviews

S Speaker 28:32and just Just a quick question on the setup. Ben, do you do you have a rag pipeline? Do you sort of have a system wherein I can put in my own brand guidelines, my own language to edit the way interviews are conducted? That's the

S Speaker 211:39So I am imagining in the workflow setup, workflow, you mentioned that they I can set up a few questions based on which the AI can dig deeper or just be surface level. What if I want to run I want to get some additional insights based on how people spoke, which are, which weren't directly covered, on the questions, can I prompt the final study to find out some additional insights from all of those conversations? Yes,

S Speaker 112:06it will launch, and next week, talk to your data feature. So we'll, we will feed a certain central knowledge system, and you can then prompt that knowledge and ask questions that were probably answered but not literally asked for. Yeah, the top tier data is a lot of just next week. Interesting,

S Speaker 112:53It's not platformized. So quantitative research has been platformized. You have, like, the savvy stores, the Qualtrics, videos of the world that have, let's say, platformized, automated, a lot of quantitative flows. Qualitative research is agency based. Like it's there's no platforms that offer the entire flow. It often goes into a traditional consulting agency. You start from a research brief. You have a bit of a back and forth. They manually hire some moderators in the countries that you wanted to research. They create a Topic Guide. Then they have other analysts that will transcribe, analyze the data that come back. Since it's a currently, it's very consulting, consulting driven, while the actual value add of the consultants is isn't really there. It's the last step is translating all the insights that you have into a compelling story that you will will, let's say, present to your internal stakeholder. And that's what the actual internal the in house people love to do. Everything else is sort of manual labor that is not super intelligent, if you will, right?

It's not platformized. So quantitative research has been platformized. You have, like, the savvy stores, the Qualtrics, videos of the world that have, let's say, platformized, automated, a lot of quantitative flows. Qualitative research is agency based. Like it's there's no platforms that offer the entire flow. It often goes into a traditional consulting agency. You start from a research brief. You have a bit of a back and forth. They manually hire some moderators in the countries that you wanted to research. They create a Topic Guide. Then they have other analysts that will transcribe, analyze the data that come back. Since it's a currently, it's very consulting, consulting driven, while the actual value add of the consultants is isn't really there. It's the last step is translating all the insights that you have into a compelling story that you will will, let's say, present to your internal stakeholder. And that's what the actual internal the in house people love to do. Everything else is sort of manual labor that is not super intelligent, if you will, right?
S Speaker 214:03That's very exciting. That means there is a lot of value capture opportunity. Do you sell to brands or platforms who would run these qualitative studies for themselves? Or do you sell to these agencies? In a sense,

S Speaker 114:19we're selling to brands. So we want to go to the end customer directly and basically become their system to run qualitative research so that they don't have to go to agencies anymore because they are willing to insource. That's maybe one of the unique insights into the market is that brands want to in source their qualitative research without having to hire 20 people or 30 people teams to do it. So they want to have a sort of smooth way to in house, because they want to be closer to their customer. What they don't like is sending a brief to an agency and getting a report 12 weeks later and haven't had the opportunity to directly interact or be closer to the users or customers that that they're interviewing, that they're talking to, but like published us under under LinkedIn page, which generated quite a bit of inbound, and there's a lot of these agencies that are trying to talk to us because they see, oh No, AI is going to eat away our cake. Is there a way to partner? Because the technology is too complicated to build ourselves. Traditional consulting agencies, we will not be capable of doing it, especially giving underlying technology is going so fast, they might be able to hack something together today, and then in three months, it's already outdated. And so they're looking into partnering opportunities, and they come like, hey, we have the distribution. We have the relationships with all these companies already. So hey, can we find a way where you merge our distribution and we leverage our technology, thinking through what would be the best model there. I don't want to be into a buyer, supplier relationship with them. I'm looking at them more as a managed service provider, reseller, implementation partner, but we're discussing that with a few of those

I understand it's early, and you're launching features every week, which is exciting stage, for sure, but traction and the tech on tech front, when I understand there are APIs which would allow you to do something similar in terms of just create conducting an interview based on an AI avatar, or cloning, a cloning voice of your brand, and then using that to conduct interviews. I see you have platformized The entire process, which is a differentiator, for sure, but what? How are you thinking about tech?

S Speaker 116:53into a few of these APIs, and we're not blown away by any of them, to be fairly honest. They're also very early stage. However, they are more focused on one thing, for instance, doing an actual interview based on some some some input that you provided with. So we've built Actually, everything you have is build ourselves on top of the underlying foundation of models, right? And APIs that we call there, in a very flexible way, we're using, like, GP four Oh, GPD four, oh, mini GP 406, of August, there's a bit of Claude, there's, there's, like we're using different whisper, like, there's a lot we're using there, yeah, but building most of the tech on top ourselves. At a certain point, we were using baby in our stack, fairly cool noise AI. We kicked them out because we found that their production speed was like, too slow for what we what we required as there is quite a bit of the technology that we that we do ourselves in house, that's one thing, but then it's the entire workflow, right

S Speaker 118:07There's not a lot of companies that are going to quickly combine all these different APIs built like the killer, very market informed UX UI. On top, it's a very sticky workflow into, let's say, very old fashioned, not really tech enabled, departments. So it's, I don't fear a lot of a lot of that, if there's one thing that would eat me awake, not even, but like, if one of the larger market research agencies all of a sudden becomes very tech enabled, and they have, like, distribution across many customers, and all of a sudden they build a killer platform. But honestly, Nielsen, Nielsen has been trying to platformize quantitative research for decades, and they still have a very shitty tool. So these companies, DNA is just not tech, and this tech is even more complicated than the quant side. So there, I'm not super afraid. Then on traction, it's going well. We're not self served yet, so we're not blasting into the market, onboarding users on a daily basis, where it's a top two sales motion for inbound, and we've reached out to certain people in our networks. We hit 100k ARR like immediately after we launched the product. So that's that's fairly cool.

S Speaker 119:41we have 150k error. It's fairly close. And what's interesting is that we're going directly into enterprise. We've got commitments from Unilever proper and gamble maybe in that. So these companies are, like, very excited about what we're doing, and already, without wanting to sound too braggy, like, blown away by what our tool is capable of.

S Speaker 220:23That's great to hear, and great progress. Man, very exciting. How are you thinking about pricing it? How would the business model be. What sort of account sizes do you think you can land right now? How do you plan to expand that? Yeah,

I want to go for adoption, adoption now, so I'm not like, I'm not gonna be my own enemy by already pricing usage as we speak. So now I'm trying to land unlimited deals, and then at some point they renew with a usage based component in there. ACBS currently contract size between 25k and 25k that we, that we, that we see. But these are really like early stage small contracts to lure people in and to go for adoption rights and to get excitement. When you look at the larger enterprise brands, they spend an absurd amount of quantitative research. Mexico spends around 100 million annually. 90% of that flows into traditional qual methods, talking to people, conducting the interviews, analyzing what comes up. So there's even if I, even if I could get, get one to 10% of that budget. These are, these are wonderful ACPs to to look forward to in the enterprise segment, the long tail, let's say mid, mid market segment.

S Speaker 222:11ACP that's that's very exciting, and I certainly agree that the market is huge. There also seems to be a big aspect of some of these revenues to be recurring in nature. So there's the market certainly seems to be sticky, I guess, taking a step back, and this question is coming, because I don't understand how some of these brands conduct their qualitative interviews right now. Is the biggest problem? Is the biggest friction in conducting that entire process, or is the biggest friction in sort of identifying and getting these interviewees to sign up for a sense, and do you plan to be tackling the latter part of the problem,

We're integrated with a few we're testing them and sort of trying to always use the highest quality inflow of respondents. Currently it's respondent.io that we're most excited about. So that's not the main problem is just how cumbersome the entire process is.
