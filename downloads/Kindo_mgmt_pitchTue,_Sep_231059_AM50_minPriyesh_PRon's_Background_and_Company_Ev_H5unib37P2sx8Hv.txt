S Speaker 41:55Yeah, that's, yeah, it's been, it's been a fun summer, like we really feel the get all the tailwinds pushing and starting, you know, feeling that cool also. And it's been good. It's been a long time coming. You know, we're, we just crossed three years, and we were going to be early, but, you know, we were betting things would, would move faster than than other tech stacks and and they certainly have, and it's been, it's been, it's been super interesting to live through this big AI shift. So and exciting too, right? Yes, a lot of change.

S Speaker 65:31have pleasure, to connect to Ron and Brian and so you know, my background is in Product Engineering at Qualcomm and then we've been investing in a lot of AI infrastructure Qualcomm ventures over the last five or so years, and Deepak has been spending a lot of time in desktops, and so We're looking forward to learning more about kind of Yeah,

S Speaker 36:03awesome. So you know, just maybe some color on, some creative first, connected with with the team here and Brian, I met you at the black hat, and we've been in multiple discussions. And seems like there are, there's a series please save or pre CDs be safe that's on ongoing, and there are multiple M and A conversations, let's keep that part from maybe the latter half of the discussion. Maybe we can get started. I don't know if I'll just bring my other team members if anybody else is joining, but maybe we can get started

S Speaker 523:36just gonna also say like, I have a demo example of like, kind of like, sort of an investigation, if you, if you want to just actually, like, see it, see it live.

S Speaker 323:47I think that's the best way, because I it's still unclear whether, I mean, I, of course, I understand. It's still unclear whether it's a finished product or somebody can build and customize it, right? Let's, let's dig in.

S Speaker 424:01Yeah, just picking that up, I'll answer that question. So this is a turnkey system, right? So the customers we drop into don't have time to build their own AI stuff or be experts on it. So Kenda is a full end user platform for the IT person, along with the full back end platform for the controls and admin and other things that you need to drive things. Okay, so you guys can see my screen. You make it bigger.

S Speaker 524:27Brian, I'll close this ground. Okay, so this is, this is the kind of interface I'm just going to kind of show you real quick, is, I mean, we have a bunch of different agents. The agents are effectively, so we have two modalities in the product, you know, I kind of showed you. Let me actually just start with, like, a basic example, just to kind of show you, you know, you start from a place of, like, the something that looks kind of like chatgpt or something, but it's got all these connected services that we can use as well, you know. So I can turn these on and off. I can set individual policies such as, like, auto approve the actions that this, this thing is going to take. You know, I can make I can ask questions of this ephemerally, like

S Speaker 325:11Brian, all these connectors are these MCP connectors? Have you integrated through APIs?
Brian, all these connectors are these MCP connectors? Have you integrated through APIs?
Brian, all these connectors are these MCP connectors? Have you integrated through APIs?
Brian, all these connectors are these MCP connectors? Have you integrated through APIs?
S Speaker 525:18Yeah, these are all MCP servers that we manage right built and manage ourselves. We part of the reason for that is that, well, this, the spec for MCP has evolved quite substantially. When we started working on this, they really, they mostly, they were mostly focused on, like the standard, standard IO version of MCP and, like, the authorization strategy that they had didn't really conform to our security policies. So we we basically have our own form of, like, secrets, credentials injection into MCP servers. The standard has evolved now. So it's so we actually, our CSO, actually built out a MCP security scanner that we're now using, and so we're going to probably start introducing some third party MCP servers in the near future, if they pass our security muster. But that's kind of the reason why, initially we've kind of built out all them ourselves. But yeah, it is just to show you, like, a very basic example of, like, I just gave it a very simple command. It's got, it's got linear issues, connected linear as a connected service, just like a ticketing system. This can be Jira, anything, and it's just going to, like, go fetch that data and give me a summary, so that power is available across all these different services. And I can also put this on a trigger. So that's kind of like where agents come in. Agents can either be run manually, so like, maybe I've got, like, this whole workflow or saved prompts that I know works well and I want to run it manually, or you can put it on a trigger. So this one in particular is on a trigger, so I have it set up on JIRA. So when any JIRA ticket comes in, it's going to go run this whole runbook. We don't necessarily need to go through the whole details of the prompt, but generally speaking, if you want to do something pretty sophisticated at like a production level, it's going to be pretty sophisticated, something that looks pretty similar to, like a runbook that you might have for some sort of incident investigation. I just added one final step here, like, and then when you're done, can you send me a note of that notification on Slack. So what this this agent, is going to do is it's basically going to take, you know, this JIRA ticket and grab the alert that came from CrowdStrike and then do an investigation on it, and then go make some decisions about what policies that we might want to change. So jumping over here to JIRA, we can do is we can just clone this one. This is just kind of for the demo purposes to kind of kick, kick the kick. The agent off again. So since it's on a trigger, we jump back over here and open up our agent runs. We should see it running. And so here it goes. It's starting to go ahead and run, and so what this is going to do is go collect all that information live. So it first grabs the JIRA ticket. That's what kicked this thing off. From that it grabbed some information about the CrowdStrike alert, and now it's just going through and following that prompt, as you saw, was a pretty extensive prompt, and that's what's really driving the actions that it's taken here. It's grabbing all this different information about the devices. This particular scenario is around malware. So there was, like a detected malware on a device. CrowdStrike successfully quarantined that device, so it's alerting the agent about what do we want to do about this? So the policies of like what to actually do is all encoded into that natural language prompt. Now this is just going and gathering all the Recon that it needs in order to decide what policy should be changed. So that's going to go run for a little bit. While that's running I'm just going to show you eventually, once this is done, these are some of the policies that it's going to change. So you can just see that they're all disabled now, but these are all related to some of the Mac malware prevention policies that you could enable in CrowdStrike, just as a preventative measure. So we'll jump
Yeah, these are all MCP servers that we manage right built and manage ourselves. We part of the reason for that is that, well, this, the spec for MCP has evolved quite substantially.

S Speaker 529:28Oh, yeah, no, I probably did, because here you can see, like the tool update policies of a refresh list, yeah, now they're all enabled. So that's that's when it got to the end and it says, Yep, all these, all these policies should be enabled. So then it kind of gives me a comprehensive summary. So it talks about the timeline of the event, the device information attack chain. I mean, it's still, still going. I think it's gonna get into the, you know, some assessments might even go into, like the the miter attack framework. But, you know, it's a pretty extensive like right here.

30:11Yeah, so if we go
S Speaker 430:15was a JIRA ticket that CrowdStrike had created. Brian clone did a JIRA detecting a malware attack.

was a JIRA ticket that CrowdStrike had created. Brian clone did a JIRA detecting a malware attack.
S Speaker 530:23Yeah, very light. It basically just included, like the alert ID from CrowdStrike for like, demo purposes. I mean, this could include a lot of information, but for the purpose of this demo, what we wanted to show is that just from some simple information, JIRA that kicked it off, it saw the alert ID that is an ID for CrowdStrike, and then it's going to go rather all that information that it needs on its own from for CrowdStrike.
Yeah, very light. It basically just included, like the alert ID from CrowdStrike for like, demo purposes.

S Speaker 430:52Actually a really good example of one of the key problems that you know it and security deal with is tickets, when they get created, aren't normalized like a database, and so human could create that ticket, or some random tool like CrowdStrike could create it, and you get all kinds of non standard ticket structures. But because the LLM can work semantically, right, it can pick that ticket up and understand the intent of that ticket and immediately start enriching where human would have to do all that work manually themselves to figure out, wait, what is this ticket trying to tell me, what's it doing. So, you know, all that just massively compresses time to resolution for the these this type of work, right? Creating really high ROI for security team, where they're using AI to do the work instead

S Speaker 531:39of manually on this, like, this is so that final step, I said, Okay, now and then ping me on Slack. So that's so if, if I was like, the, you know, SecOps operator here, this might actually be the first time I saw it. So there's ever mode out modes we can have here, like, for example, right now we actually had it go set those policies because the the pulse, sorry, it changed those policies because of the policies we have at Kindle allowed it to go take those actions. In another scenario, we might say block for human approval if there's an action that you're about to take. So in that case, we would have had a different output here on Slack that says this thing came in. Here's the assessment, here's the recommendation, click here to go approve the action. So in this case, we just had it go, take the action. But in another scenario, you could set it up for human in the loop approval, so that the SecOps professional gets alerted. They say, Okay, let me go take a look. All the analysis is already been completed, and all they have to do is approve the action.

S Speaker 732:38Hey, Brian, is there a way to automatically validate the suggested action, what the action taken is indeed the best way to take the actions?
Hey, Brian, is there a way to automatically validate the suggested action, what the action taken is indeed the best way to take the actions?
Hey, Brian, is there a way to automatically validate the suggested action, what the action taken is indeed the best way to take the actions?
Hey, Brian, is there a way to automatically validate the suggested action, what the action taken is indeed the best way to take the actions?
S Speaker 532:49Yeah, there's a lot of different ways to tackle that some some teams may use, like a governance and control system that kind of defines like their set of policies, or it could be in a document. So another option would be within this, this whole threat analysis, I can always attach files that might correspond to policies that you'd want to have to enforce within that organization. There's a lot of different ways to apply that validation. It just depends on what how those policies are defined and how you want to, you could ask, add an extra step here. It just depends on whether those policies are defined in documents or in some other system, or if you need to run some like test of some kind like sometimes they might, you might want to, even after an action is taken, verify that the effects have been, you know, applied. This can apply. This might make sense in the case of like, somebody requesting access to a system. So some of the other use cases are, let's first say, what are this you this user trying to get access to do this action in this system? So first of all, some, some of these systems are pretty complicated. Like Esper Hana is like one of the integrations that we recently added, it's got a pretty complex set of policies and roles and affordances that you can grant users. So even just figuring out, like exactly what access they need, what entitlements they need, it can be tricky. But then you may also want to run that through a GRC system to validate whether this is going to break any sort of policy. And at the very end, if you're going to move forward, then you can add another step to say, okay, was this user actually able to then now take the action. So if there's like, an administrator, like, you know, act as this user, then you can kind of use that to, like, do a final test. There's a lot of different ways to you to
Yeah, there's a lot of different ways to tackle that some some teams may use, like a governance and control system that kind of defines like their set of policies, or it could be in a document.

S Speaker 734:46So earlier, I think you mentioned vulnerability management, right? So do you plug into Wiz? Do you plug in plug into tenable to get all these vulnerability signals? And then you go on to the automated mediation.

35:02Yeah, that's right. So,
Yeah, that's right. So,
Yeah, that's right. So,
Yeah, that's right. So,
S Speaker 535:05so any of those systems we can hook into, and you know that that, like, the real benefit to hooking that up into an agent system like ours is that it can take a lot of tedious human power to go investigate, especially like the medium vulnerabilities, low vulnerabilities. So we can go hook into those systems, pull all those reports, and then, you know, it depends on what the human would want to do in those scenarios, and what the type of vulnerability threat is like for one it it could be, well, let's try to exploit that vulnerability. So one thing I've I failed to mention here is that all these agents in our system have access to a Linux VM sandbox, so it's fully isolated and protected. You know, sandbox, but they can run arbitrary code. They can run arbitrary Linux commands. It's actually a Kali Linux installation that we're using. And so what, what you can actually set an agent to do is say, all right, given this vulnerability, can you write a Python script that would exploit that vulnerability and then try to run it against our system so you can kind of use it for red teaming if there's a particular vulnerability. In other scenarios, you might want to take that wiz report and maybe it's a configuration change that's needed, so you might want to just access your AWS environment and use the what's been identified in wiz or tenable wiz would probably more like the configuration management side of it, and then you could have that go read the policies or the configuration that you have set up in AWS, but, but, yes, those are absolutely the type of integrations that we'd want to have, that we have in order to do, like, vulnerability management,

S Speaker 736:43and how do you measure the efficacy of your remediation? Like, do you have any case studies or industry benchmarks you can run through to show you know, out of the 100 cases, 100 warnings and you're able to address, like, what percentage of it?

S Speaker 537:03We don't have any stats like that, like you're asking for right now, typically for things that would involve changes to systems, that's kind of where the human in the loop is pretty important. So the way we kind of think, think through it is, you're using, like, AI agents to really kind of sift through the noise, because a lot of these things are probably going to be, you know, false positives and maybe things that a human wouldn't have even, like, spent time looking at, because too much belong tail. So a lot of times, like, especially for like, a wiz report, what you really might want to do is, like, out of these 1000s of medium and low priority vulnerabilities that's identified. Which one should we actually spend some human time on? And you may not want the agent to actually go take action, but maybe it just surfaces. Actually, this one's one to look at. Here's what the the expected action is, but the human still in control of actually taking the final step.

S Speaker 737:57So in your in your actual deployments, that you have 11 enterprises deployed, right? And how many of these actually let your agent take action? Because when we talk to Qualcomm, IT security team, they're very cautious. Yeah, they don't want anything to touch their configuration,

S Speaker 438:17yes, so that it's totally enterprise dependent and with today's state of models, I would expect most customers not letting them make any kind of production level change. So this, we would advise that actually, but inside of kinda though, the way you can build more complicated agents that will actually pause and say, Hey, would you like me to make this change? Or would you like me to go deeper? The agent becomes interactive, right? So that while it's running, the human can step in and do and do different things. The ROI today, with where models are today, is in tackling kind of the pre work, the grind work, the research work, be making good suggestions for the humans to follow, and now freeing them up to only worry about those key things that you need humans involved in. However, Kindle where we differentiate a lot of automation tooling. We don't write a lot of extraneous code to make up for where the models are we today? Because we're taking the bet the models get better and better all the time, and they have so far. And for the foreseeable future, it certainly looks like we're going to see at least one or two more major generation of models like the money's been spent by OpenAI and cloud and Nvidia and everybody else, right? And so when you buy Kindle, you're just taking the bet that the models will improve to get you even further down the road than they can today. They can already get you very far. It's easily buildable use cases for clear ROI to customers today. But as the models improve, you just switch to that model, and now you have a whole new set of capabilities in Kinder which would include, now, okay, I can actually trust this thing to go make production changes. The models just aren't quite there yet. They're getting very close, but they're not quite there yet. We have customers that rewrite code with the models and push that off for pull requests so that they'll go to that point, but then the pull request process still has human review to make sure there's not problems. It also has AI review as well to double check again so so you can get pretty far. But you know, because, because of the limitations of the model themselves, they're just not perfect yet. And no one should be telling a customer they are today. They're just, they're just not there yet.

40:40Okay, thanks, yep,
S Speaker 540:41just, just real quick. I may just want to kind of show like this. This is actually an example of a previous, like, pen test run. So I gave it a pretty simple, you know, conduct a pen test against this leaky money. This is just kind of like an intentionally problematic website, but I'm giving a pretty light description of, like, what I want it to do, and it's just going to do it's going to use the sandbox, so it's doing all these exec commands I got. Each of these exec commands are basically something that's going to do in that sandbox to basically do a whole bunch of reconnaissance. And you can just see, like, little by little, it just keeps investigating various things. And eventually it figures out, like, Okay, I've figured out the admin password, able to, you know, query the database. There's all kinds of things that is able to find as a result of this. So, like, at least can be really, like, powerful for any kind of red teaming. But in this case, it's not actually taking action. This ends up being a compiled report that's useful for your team to say, like, all right, here's the assessment. And you know, as you probably know, like red teaming, like running a whole red team process, can be both really expensive and time consuming. So being able to just, like, a few clicks of a button get, like, a report that's pretty comprehensive about what its findings are is is pretty, pretty pretty useful.
just, just real quick. I may just want to kind of show like this. This is actually an example of a previous, like, pen test run.

S Speaker 442:17Happy. Do that. Maybe one, just another quick thing on the product, just so it's just really clear there's a lot of other security automation stuff. Now, where we differentiate is it's aI native, so there's no boxes to drag in lines of deterministic if, then if their code building that all the other agent builder guys have. Another really important one is it's fully self manageable, so you don't have to trust kendo this whole stack. You can run your own cloud environment or on premise, if you needed to. And so that's that's a very large differentiator. The customers we tend to win are ones that care about self managed and on prem, the to the rest of it. So yeah, like we when we left Black House the first time we were out in the public with a real booth and introducing things. It got a lot of attention. We had a pretty good sized booth, both some great leads for customers, but some in many, activity happened afterwards, like we started getting outreaches. The there was one very strong one in particular, we've been going through that process. The board was like, Look, we don't want to sell race to be but you know, if someone offers something crazy, we might kind of consider it or whatever. Plus, it will just be interesting to see how the markets kind of pricing things in general, so and so. So we've been running working with that. This is one of the very large consulting companies that sees kendo as an existential problem solver for them, because consulting in particular is at great risk of being automated out. They're already starting to feel it. And kendo has this enterprise ready drop in tool set to initially tackle their security consulting stuff, but they see it as maybe something broader down the road too. And so for them, it's like an enabler of, you know, AI transformation inside of an enterprise. The but for there's others that have kind of reached out. We just kind of been holding off a little bit, waiting to see where this kind of bigger consulting company lands. And we're do something from them this week. Actually, I've got a catch up call with them at two o'clock today, and then they've committed to getting us at least what they're thinking ballpark wise, before the end of the month, so maybe a few more days before we have real clarity. But we've been working very closely with them, doing deep POCs. They're introducing us to their biggest enterprise customers, you know, customers that they're building 50 million, 100 million a year on security services tube and, and presenting kendo as the solution to problems. So worst case, we're going to end up with a great partnership and and then kind of racing off to to our be round, I guess. And that's kind of where we really want to be. And then along the way, we need to raise right now, we did our we did this kind of a round thing with drive about 1617, months ago. We need, we need to put some more money on the balance sheet to get to be round. So as we were going to black hat, I started the process, and we met somewhere around there, I think, for the first time. And then the M and A activity just kind of slowed things down as we went. We're going to wrap that up, though. We just want to raise a safe. We were thinking of doing a price round. We just couldn't, with the M and A activity, put any kind of price on stuff. So we want to do a discounted safe. Put a liquidation preference in for that safe in case we do exit, so you're not wasting your time. You'll get a you'll get a nice, a nice bump for for a couple months of us sitting on your money. And then, and then we get to be around. We think our B round metrics, three and a half, 4 million in revenue. We think we're going to be there close at the end of the year. It might lead into January. Kind of timeframe. We have meta in our pipeline right now, we're heading to POC with vulture, which is one of the Neo clouds that's growing very fast. Both of those look at they're gonna be mid six figure landing deals,
Happy. Do that. Maybe one, just another quick thing on the product, just so it's just really clear there's a lot of other security automation stuff.
