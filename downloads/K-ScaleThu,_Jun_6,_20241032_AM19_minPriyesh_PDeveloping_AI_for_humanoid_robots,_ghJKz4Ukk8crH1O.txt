S Speaker 10:07And if you have enough of a partnership with the company that's building it, because they also want their robot to work well. Like they're, they're trying to sell humanoid robots do so. Like, you know we can do that it's essentially though it's like yeah, like we want to we want to be the we want to like be the company that gets into the mud with with these things and gets into the weeds of like how exactly are these things built? Like how do we make these partnerships actually work out like this is why we're doing what we're doing. Like yeah, you have to you have to do that if

S Speaker 20:44you want to get the you want to be on Android what we just mean do you want to be the OS of these robots or do you want to be the thinking layer, which is the primary the that might not be a model for the robots.

S Speaker 10:58Right now, we wouldn't be the glue between really good sort of robotics foundation models and really good Chinese hardware, like essentially like the company that's missing in that space, at least like for the immediate future is there's no glue. And this is because of things like you know, like if you want to run a model on real time, and this is this is basically what I did at Tesla was getting getting our perception models to run in real time on the hardware. Like if you want to do that, it actually is very non trivial. In fact, this is why I got a call from the Qualcomm deaf get this even like, if you ask like an average ml person how to like develop a model for a Qualcomm word. It's, you'd be surprised how few people will actually know So essentially, like right now we want to be the glue because that company is missing is like the the company that can glue foundation models onto humanoid robots. That company doesn't exist right now. And I think that that company is where the moat long term will be built, because that's more analogous to like a Microsoft, you know, the less level thing where once let's see the ML models are working well on the robot, then, you know, robot hardware manufacturers will sort of have an incentive to respect that robot for this kind of like general you know, open source spec. And that thing will be the thing that lets us kind of, like, it makes sure that we can close this data feedback loop. And ultimately, that data feedback loop is the most valuable thing and that's what's gonna lead us to have those models and, and sort of the, the physical intelligence or the skill of the worlds is essentially the willingness to kind of like, go and do all of this, like, not sexiest of basically, the foreseeable future. Yeah.

S Speaker 22:51Okay, that's good. And so, in order or would love so so you said did you try Did you already get the board?
Okay, that's good. And so, in order or would love so so you said did you try Did you already get the board?
Okay, that's good. And so, in order or would love so so you said did you try Did you already get the board?
Okay, that's good. And so, in order or would love so so you said did you try Did you already get the board?
S Speaker 13:04We had the clock on CUCM 8550. From those from time to time. Yeah. Yeah. I haven't actually tried it out yet because we're we're sort of in a different state. We're basically focusing now on on the the electronics, the lower level electronics and yeah, I think we're gonna we have we have a OS that we're flashing with the Jetson right now, but I don't, I don't conceptually like the idea of being tied to Nvidia hardware actually. I can show you our this is our hardware rate. So we've got a bunch of like, sins in here and we have we have a sort of operating system stuff building for that. Yeah. Yeah, I did say I got the wrong one because I, I want to so like, I feel like this is also like just conceptually, like, if you think about a world where there's going to be, you know, 100 million robots like, yeah, probably it'll run Qualcomm chips. At some point you need to have snapdragons powering robots, but like for now, it's not. It's probably not going to happen. So but I got the board just to like, make sure that we can actually know
We had the clock on CUCM 8550. From those from time to time. Yeah. Yeah. I haven't actually tried it out yet because we're we're sort of in a different state.

S Speaker 24:16where you're on point. Yes. In a world where you have in a world even in a world where you get to 5 million plus robots. It's gonna be hard. It's gonna have to run a Qualcomm ish hardware. But in a world where you have 10,000 robots, you might be on an NVIDIA Jetson hardware for now. And with you, I mean, I have my clock on but but at the same time, I think what we're trying to do is we're also trying to enable that, that 10,000 Now, which is a big effort around the company to develop our first first if the focus for the company and so, so you made some inroads it's just we have this something called AI model hub, Qualcomm AI model hub, running your model on different types of hardware. So it's like a few clicks and you can try it out all that right. So so we're enabling better than we had we're trying to hide distribution with it as well, which is we're trying to get them to common everybody to actually go release hardware kits that are like in play things.
where you're on point. Yes. In a world where you have in a world even in a world where you get to 5 million plus robots. It's gonna be hard. It's gonna have to run a Qualcomm ish hardware.

S Speaker 15:23They've seen it maybe you're responsible for a reach up to Thunder calm, and then they didn't hit that connected and then the undercard person finally got back to me and I say, Well, I was able to get the debit.
They've seen it maybe you're responsible for a reach up to Thunder calm, and then they didn't hit that connected and then the undercard person finally got back to me and I say, Well, I was able to get the debit.

S Speaker 25:39We who used to do it. Okay, so how much have you raised and then are you thinking of fundraising anytime soon?
We who used to do it. Okay, so how much have you raised and then are you thinking of fundraising anytime soon?
We who used to do it. Okay, so how much have you raised and then are you thinking of fundraising anytime soon?
We who used to do it. Okay, so how much have you raised and then are you thinking of fundraising anytime soon?
S Speaker 15:50Yeah, so we're so we're so that was safe. We were doing a bunch of safes. We haven't done like a price trends yet. We're we raised about 4 million so far. And then yeah, this is run away for about two years. And basically, we're now kind of just like heads down on getting the robot working. Yeah.
Yeah, so we're so we're so that was safe. We were doing a bunch of safes. We haven't done like a price trends yet. We're we raised about 4 million so far. And then yeah, this is run away for about two years. And basically, we're now kind of just like heads down on getting the robot working. Yeah.

6:15Okay, so you're not gonna raise anytime in the near future?
Okay, so you're not gonna raise anytime in the near future?
Okay, so you're not gonna raise anytime in the near future?
Okay, so you're not gonna raise anytime in the near future?
S Speaker 16:18Yeah, we're, I mean, we're taking on like, you know, 500k checks every now and then just to like, you know, people that want to put in a smaller check, but we're not like actively pitching. We don't You don't need money right now. I guess. No.
Yeah, we're, I mean, we're taking on like, you know, 500k checks every now and then just to like, you know, people that want to put in a smaller check, but we're not like actively pitching. We don't You don't need money right now. I guess. No.

S Speaker 27:48got an active community already. So that's pretty good. Yeah,
got an active community already. So that's pretty good. Yeah,
got an active community already. So that's pretty good. Yeah,
got an active community already. So that's pretty good. Yeah,
S Speaker 17:52it's been exciting. I mean, it's pretty cool to see. I think people broadly do want this in the world. So it's like, it's cool to see like, Yeah, this is sort of orthogonal, but I'm sort of a personal kind of what I'm excited about for the future. I feel like it's a much more exciting the future if there's hundreds or 1000s of different humanoid robots out in the world instead of just like some a couple of large companies. I think it's also like kind of an inevitability, I think. It's like it's a little hubris for someone like figure or whoever to think that they're going to be the only humanoid robot company in the future if if you expect it to go the way that like, PCs went. So I'm excited but it takes people to actually build that feature. So
it's been exciting. I mean, it's pretty cool to see. I think people broadly do want this in the world. So it's like, it's cool to see like, Yeah, this is sort of orthogonal, but I'm sort of a personal kind of what I'm excited about for the future.

S Speaker 28:42I'm curious to get your thoughts on, you know, Optimus versus bigger versus 1x versus app Tronic. You know, that like the US ones?
I'm curious to get your thoughts on, you know, Optimus versus bigger versus 1x versus app Tronic. You know, that like the US ones?
I'm curious to get your thoughts on, you know, Optimus versus bigger versus 1x versus app Tronic. You know, that like the US ones?
I'm curious to get your thoughts on, you know, Optimus versus bigger versus 1x versus app Tronic. You know, that like the US ones?
S Speaker 28:59Yeah. Do any of those have anything special out of these? That and of course, we don't know much about optimization unless you know more about computers, but where any of the these do you think do they have a shot? At even shipping something that is that is working on it in the next Keymaster performance?
Yeah. Do any of those have anything special out of these? That and of course, we don't know much about optimization unless you know more about computers, but where any of the these do you think do they have a shot?

S Speaker 19:23Yeah, I mean, I think I think when x is really good, I like I really like when x I've, I think a bunch of people reach out to me about actually go work at Tessa. I kind of have been funneling them to go work at 1x is a I'm friends with Eric dang over there. Yeah. I think they're gonna ship Neo. You know, they knew it looks like good personally, but I think they will ship it. I think that their problem is is just like it's kind of worse in every way than the entry G one, two, and I think that at this point, the market is just like not that large. Were like, Yeah,
Yeah, I mean, I think I think when x is really good, I like I really like when x I've, I think a bunch of people reach out to me about actually go work at Tessa. I kind of have been funneling them to go work at 1x is a I'm friends with Eric dang over there. Yeah. I think they're gonna ship Neo.

S Speaker 210:00but then the robot doesn't do much today for their first and then it's, it's like, what was it good mostly security robot?
but then the robot doesn't do much today for their first and then it's, it's like, what was it good mostly security robot?
but then the robot doesn't do much today for their first and then it's, it's like, what was it good mostly security robot?
but then the robot doesn't do much today for their first and then it's, it's like, what was it good mostly security robot?
S Speaker 110:15yeah, I mean, they're, they're sort of first. Like, at some point, I think there's going to be an inflection point where the utility of a robot passes the cost. So you need to drive the cost down quite a bit and then you need to drive the utility up quite a bit. Yes. I don't I don't think that that inflection point will happen as soon as a lot of people are expecting just because it's the same with self driving, like where people saw DARPA Grand Challenge get solved and they thought self driving robot taxis were around the corner and now 10 years later, like, so they don't have that ball. We have way mo but it's a it turned out to be a much harder problem than people thought. I think robotics to real world AI also falls into the same bucket where this is like sort of a meta point, but I don't think that you can operate effectively as a, you know, high Beck's company right now. Like, it's like the ionic companies in self driving were the ones that died. And I think that there's now several very high capex, humanoid robot companies, and I just expect them to also die. So we'll see. I mean, you know, but in terms of potential question, I do think that when x is probably the closest and I really do hope that they succeed, just because I think it'll be good for the ecosystem to have have them sort of do well, long term. Tesla will sort of always be around but you know, Elon is projections I think people are now catching on to the fact that his projections are wildly optimistic. I don't think they're going to have something for sale for another another five years.

S Speaker 211:49For Sale. No, if but maybe the floor is something I was curious that they they were able they will be able to deploy something for their own factories by next year. Yeah,
For Sale. No, if but maybe the floor is something I was curious that they they were able they will be able to deploy something for their own factories by next year. Yeah,
For Sale. No, if but maybe the floor is something I was curious that they they were able they will be able to deploy something for their own factories by next year. Yeah,
For Sale. No, if but maybe the floor is something I was curious that they they were able they will be able to deploy something for their own factories by next year. Yeah,
S Speaker 213:04collecting data. And that's a very good point. Yeah. I think. Yes. So through all of these, I think, I guess, fingers going after the same for now.
collecting data. And that's a very good point. Yeah. I think. Yes. So through all of these, I think, I guess, fingers going after the same for now.
collecting data. And that's a very good point. Yeah. I think. Yes. So through all of these, I think, I guess, fingers going after the same for now.
collecting data. And that's a very good point. Yeah. I think. Yes. So through all of these, I think, I guess, fingers going after the same for now.
S Speaker 113:16Yeah, that was like, I mean, this the thing is, like, I think someone had asked me in some interview that for whatever you like, a lot like I don't know, it's Robert Scoble did some interview of us when when we did our open house a few months ago. And he was like, because he said, that's like, I like read his figures. I think figures is a massive waste of money. I don't know. I don't know how people sort of fell for it. It reminds me so much of like Nikola, like the hydrogen hire, like, you know, it's like it's something that it sounds like a good business idea if you don't if you've never actually sort of spent time engineering on the engineering side of these things and know the how difficult different types of problems are so yeah, I was also just like, the other thing is like, a lot of the humanoid robot companies are started by people that have done hardware in some form or another. And they just fundamentally don't think that the hardware is the hard part. So it was more of like a sort of, in terms of where I want it to go where I just didn't want to work for someone that wasn't a, like an ML engineer that was actually familiar with the difficulty of building ml models for the real world. And then the companies that could have worked out like I had a second to the CEO of like fun robotics and they're more ml oriented but they were like, I we just need someone to go and like build the robot for us. You've got we've got liberal we've got like all these great ml people. So we'll hire you because you have done real world deployment if that's what you want me to go build the product for you i Why don't I just go start my own company. So that's kind of that's kind of how that happens. Sort of Yeah, wait, wait, see, I think was not like I find a way see, like very last minute. Kind of on the idea that this is what I wanted to do. So it's kind of okay, so far. So, but yes, okay. Really.
Yeah, that was like, I mean, this the thing is, like, I think someone had asked me in some interview that for whatever you like, a lot like I don't know, it's Robert Scoble did some interview of us when when we did our open house a few months ago.

S Speaker 215:11Good. Benjamin. I'm curious. Would you be interested in our check in the note, if that's something that we can maybe meet? You maybe not 500k but a million? Let's say I have.
Good. Benjamin. I'm curious. Would you be interested in our check in the note, if that's something that we can maybe meet? You maybe not 500k but a million? Let's say I have.

Good. Benjamin. I'm curious. Would you be interested in our check in the note, if that's something that we can maybe meet? You maybe not 500k but a million? Let's say I have.
S Speaker 115:28Yeah, actually. Yeah. So Alex did 2 million. We actually had like originally been looking around for maybe a larger institutional investor. Yeah, so like, I think I have space on the Save for like up to like 12 million. We'd be happy to do like, up to one to 2 million. Yeah. Okay.
Yeah, actually. Yeah. So Alex did 2 million. We actually had like originally been looking around for maybe a larger institutional investor. Yeah, so like, I think I have space on the Save for like up to like 12 million. We'd be happy to do like, up to one to 2 million. Yeah. Okay.

15:51So then maybe let's do this. Did you ever have a deck?
So then maybe let's do this. Did you ever have a deck?
So then maybe let's do this. Did you ever have a deck?
So then maybe let's do this. Did you ever have a deck?
S Speaker 115:59Yeah, I do. I can. I can port it over. If you can send
Yeah, I do. I can. I can port it over. If you can send
Yeah, I do. I can. I can port it over. If you can send
Yeah, I do. I can. I can port it over. If you can send
S Speaker 216:03me that that can be great. And then we can discuss next steps. Next. We can even meet in person next. So coordinate so it's not it's like a 10 minute drive?
me that that can be great. And then we can discuss next steps. Next. We can even meet in person next. So coordinate so it's not it's like a 10 minute drive?
me that that can be great. And then we can discuss next steps. Next. We can even meet in person next. So coordinate so it's not it's like a 10 minute drive?
me that that can be great. And then we can discuss next steps. Next. We can even meet in person next. So coordinate so it's not it's like a 10 minute drive?
S Speaker 216:17that'd be great. Let's do that. This was I really enjoyed our conversation. Yeah. Thank you, anything else from your creation and
that'd be great. Let's do that. This was I really enjoyed our conversation. Yeah. Thank you, anything else from your creation and
that'd be great. Let's do that. This was I really enjoyed our conversation. Yeah. Thank you, anything else from your creation and
that'd be great. Let's do that. This was I really enjoyed our conversation. Yeah. Thank you, anything else from your creation and
S Speaker 316:29not really, thanks a lot for this. We didn't get to chat about Ben's blog, but I'll post the link to you. It's amazing. Music.
not really, thanks a lot for this. We didn't get to chat about Ben's blog, but I'll post the link to you. It's amazing. Music.
not really, thanks a lot for this. We didn't get to chat about Ben's blog, but I'll post the link to you. It's amazing. Music.
not really, thanks a lot for this. We didn't get to chat about Ben's blog, but I'll post the link to you. It's amazing. Music.
