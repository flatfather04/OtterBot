S Speaker 11:05You know Priyesh. Thank you so much for making time. I lead talent for Z 47 we've been previously known as matrix partners India. I may sound a bit entitled here, but I come with a bit of an assumption that you know about us, but give you as a fund if not going to go a bit more granular, but intention today is not to get into an evaluatory mode. It's too early for us to do that, but I thought, let me put a face to the knee. And you know, I'm sure Radha and team would have given you more context, but I'll try to connect the dots better for you. So I lead Canada for the fund. I've been here for around six years. I came at the start of fund three. We're deploying on a fund for a we're prepping for fund five, right from a data backward perspective, we are around 3.5 billion in a fund for as is, without employee, you know, without the IRR in place, around 72 portfolio companies. To be precise. There are a couple of term sheets here and there, but broadly, 7072, portfolio and then we have the DVC, which is a decentralized precede Fund, which is a 20 million fund, which we started in. Fund three, which is around 100, 110, portfolio companies already, right? And then fifth fund, we are thinking to, you know, do a bit more growth, you know, because currently we do a media check size of four to 6 million USD to start with, but we've done a two. We've done a 15, last construct with a 15 million round with another fund, right? So, so that's the quickest of where the fund is. India. Focus always has been India focused. Unlike a lot of other fund there. You know, we were raising for India. So it was a different fundraise altogether for India. So So while I lead the talent for the fun, but a big chunk of my time is primarily the portfolio companies, right? So that's the quickest of what I do. The context of this call Priyesh is, is that it's a very tricky slope, in the sense you're hiring, but we're very selectively hiring. Why I said that is we're not hiring to replace anyone at this point in time. They're very proud of the talent density that they've built what the team is doing. But VCs grow horizontally, and it's in their nature to grow horizontally, which means that with fun backwards, we would want to do more stuff, right? And and hence, some of these conversations are keeping in mind to see if we can partner with people who we think can come and increase the surface area whatever we try to do, right? So that's the greatest of where we are from a hiring perspective, you know. And hence, wanted to pick up exploratory chats, just to get a sense of what stage of that light journey are you in, right? What are you seeking to do next? Whereas investing as an aspiration for something like what we are building fits into your long term road map, and yes, in the process, maybe evangelizing it in terms of what is Priyesh brings on the table that can be complimentary for us in terms of whatever we're trying to build, right? And maybe both of us can use this conversation as a baseline to see if there can be synergies and we keep building upon it, right? So that's what I had in mind. I'm not sure if this works for you, but if it does, I would love to get to know you bit more. Absolutely.

S Speaker 24:38Rupali, I'll hold on to some of my questions for later on, and happy to give you a background about background about where I am in my journey right now. So I'll start from the beginning where I feel I've actually made some significant progress. I did my engineering undergrad from IIT Madras, and while I was studying biotechnology there, particularly wasn't very interested in the academic side of things. So I got very interested in entrepreneurship. In my second year itself, tried starting a venture of my own in the healthcare space. Was able to form a team, launch a pre MVP product, I would say, get some funding from Nirman, which is IIT Madras pre incubator cell and but I could not really find a strong product market fit for it. I had some doctors on boarded, lot of churn. Realized there's still a lot of learning for me left to do before I can make that pivot. But that experience got me very involved in entrepreneurship. And during my entire five years at IIT, I spent probably working with 10 plus startups early stage, across different roles, from growth product go to market, to be very precise, did my spent my entire undergrad working with startups. I was very particular not to go in a very big corporate house or a big tech firm as such. Wanted to be in this space. And after IIT, got chance to work with clean Max, which is an B to B renewable energy fund firm, early stage at that time, I would say we were roughly around series A although the firm,

why did you pick up this firm over others? Maybe because you, by then, been exposed to a lot of internship and company. But yeah, was there a particular reason you decided to pick this over
S Speaker 26:15others? Absolutely yes. I had an offer from another startup that I had interned with, but I would say clean Max, because they had a very established product market fit was in a growth stage. They were roughly around series A at that time, and the conversations meant, when I had the conversations with the team, it, I realized that they were expanding quite a lot in terms of their product portfolio. So when I joined, they were just a rooftop solar player. They would set up rooftop solar for a lot of corporates and sell energy as a B to B subscription, kind of a SaaS platform, mimicking that same subscription model. But they were also expanding into wind solar farms, doing had plans to do carbon credits. There were a lot of opportunities that I, particularly in my three and a half years at lean has got to take a lot of advantages from so that was, that was a reason, I would say, industry wise. I was always industry agnostic. So my early stage startup experiences were everywhere, from healthcare, Ed Tech, social media, FinTech, but then I jumped into clean tech, and I feel that that's been a, I would say, defining moment for me. I've always been sector agnostic, for that matter. And CleanMax, speaking a little bit about my experience there, I started as a Business Development Associate there, did a few green energy projects for the team, then expanded into Portfolio Management for their wind and solar farms. So at that time we were about 10 to 12, I would say, business development leaders. The team was expanding very fast. That means we were setting up a lot of a lot of wind and solar farms. So I got to take portfolio management responsibilities for about 45% of the entire top line of the company, which was our solar and wind farms at Karnataka region, very exciting opportunity. Was able to bring bottom line benefits to the company, expanding to a lot of new clients. And then in my later years, when a lot of team members moved out of Karnataka, I was given responsibilities to lead the entire team, the very big focus area for us, in terms of geography, and also, at the same time, work with try to start a couple of new ventures, although I would say I wasn't particularly personally responsible for these initiatives. I was the business development phase of it. So I tried starting the carbon credits business model for us. Did a pilot project with Facebook, which was Facebook's first carbon credit deal in entire APAC region. Now the team has expanded that business model across Google, Amazon, Apple. So it's a big, big focus area for CleanMax right now. Also did a wind solar project with Mahindra, which was our first wind solar hybrid project. Now we are doing wind solar hybrid plus carbon credits. So that's also a very big proposition that CleanMax has grown into amazing experience, I would say, three and a half years. Who did closely work with there? I closely worked with Andrew Hines. Andrew was the co founder at CleanMax. He was also the Chief Commercial Officer, and he would sit out of the Bangalore office,
others? Absolutely yes. I had an offer from another startup that I had interned with, but I would say clean Max, because they had a very established product market fit was in a growth stage.

Now we are doing wind solar hybrid plus carbon credits. So that's also a very big proposition that CleanMax has grown into amazing experience, I would say, three and a half years. Who did closely work with there? I closely worked with Andrew Hines. Andrew was the co founder at CleanMax. He was also the Chief Commercial Officer, and he would sit out of the Bangalore office,
others? Absolutely yes. I had an offer from another startup that I had interned with, but I would say clean Max, because they had a very established product market fit was in a growth stage. They were roughly around series A at that time, and the conversations meant, when I had the conversations with the team, it, I realized that they were expanding quite a lot in terms of their product portfolio. So when I joined, they were just a rooftop solar player. They would set up rooftop solar for a lot of corporates and sell energy as a B to B subscription, kind of a SaaS platform, mimicking that same subscription model. But they were also expanding into wind solar farms, doing had plans to do carbon credits. There were a lot of opportunities that I, particularly in my three and a half years at lean has got to take a lot of advantages from so that was, that was a reason, I would say, industry wise. I was always industry agnostic. So my early stage startup experiences were everywhere, from healthcare, Ed Tech, social media, FinTech, but then I jumped into clean tech, and I feel that that's been a, I would say, defining moment for me. I've always been sector agnostic, for that matter. And CleanMax, speaking a little bit about my experience there, I started as a Business Development Associate there, did a few green energy projects for the team, then expanded into Portfolio Management for their wind and solar farms. So at that time we were about 10 to 12, I would say, business development leaders. The team was expanding very fast. That means we were setting up a lot of a lot of wind and solar farms. So I got to take portfolio management responsibilities for about 45% of the entire top line of the company, which was our solar and wind farms at Karnataka region, very exciting opportunity. Was able to bring bottom line benefits to the company, expanding to a lot of new clients. And then in my later years, when a lot of team members moved out of Karnataka, I was given responsibilities to lead the entire team, the very big focus area for us, in terms of geography, and also, at the same time, work with try to start a couple of new ventures, although I would say I wasn't particularly personally responsible for these initiatives. I was the business development phase of it. So I tried starting the carbon credits business model for us. Did a pilot project with Facebook, which was Facebook's first carbon credit deal in entire APAC region. Now the team has expanded that business model across Google, Amazon, Apple. So it's a big, big focus area for CleanMax right now. Also did a wind solar project with Mahindra, which was our first wind solar hybrid project.

S Speaker 29:35I would say I brought a lot of new ideas to the team. So we would always do revenue optimization from our wind or solar farms. What that meant was we had a lot of con we had a fixed amount of energy roughly, depending on whether, on how much energy we would generate every month. We had our contracts in place on how much we have to minimum supply to some of these clients. And then we had our own ways to optimize our revenue, I would always come up. I would be the person who would always come up with new ideas on this is what we can do. We can combine our x business model with y and create a new proposition where we can supply 100% renewable energy offering to a new client, something like that. I we can combine our rooftop solar with a wind solar proposition and cover this entire energy need for a new client. So I would say I am someone who always brings new ideas to the table. That's That's particularly what I believe Andrew would remind me, remember me with and I hope he that was the that was a couple of thoughts he mentioned when he wrote my lors for MBA.

So we would look at amorphous was typically a Series A investor. So we would look at every seed deal which happened, let's say about 12 to 18 months prior, assuming that they they would be right for investment right now, and also reach out to a lot of companies opportunistically.

And if in some specific areas where there is a market pull, and Menlo has an understanding that there could be a company here, but they do not find an investment worthy candidate, also create an when new venture proposition, and work with the studio arm to validate the market.

S Speaker 220:42and probably just closing the loop on your previous question across, I would say I particularly look at venture capital today broadly across three verticals, sourcing, due diligence and portfolio support, if I will.

I do see a lot of good VCs able to find the right due diligence or due diligence the right companies all across so feel the alpha I personally could build was both on sourcing and portfolio support, sort of leveraging from some of my past operation focused roles and trying to add value to portfolio companies.

Now coming back to your Qualcomm ventures role, I'm a Senior Associate here. I work with the managing director, and I focus on AI investments. I believe Qualcomm, just through the brand name, gets me exposed to some really amazing deals, the high valuation sought after deals in AI particularly, did three investments in the last year, two in computer vision. For all these

So we have offices in six locations, India, being one of them, and in us, we deploy about $150 million a year. We don't, like every investment partner does not entire, entire team is investment partners. I am the only senior associate at the team. So get to work almost with everyone, but particularly work in AI investments with where my particular focus is, with the managing director. And every partner has some sector expertise. Like we have someone for supply chain, we have someone for dev tools, we have someone and I would say three, three partners plus me, are looking at AI investments.

But the smaller check sizes are coming from a new, recent investment strategy that we have been exploring for last year, where we have started doing seed, especially in AI deals, where if you don't come in at seed, some of these tier one investors take all the cap all the cap table, and you do not get a Series A or Series B slot in the cap table, so that that's what we have been exploring.

S Speaker 225:47I think, I think I would like to continue investing in AI and enterprise SaaS and at the same time, I'm also very open to consumer companies.

S Speaker 232:45I would love to understand where I would say is that 47 fits in the ecosystem I work very closely with like, like I said, my plan is to come back to India. So at the same time, I work very closely with a lot of investment funds in India, and a broader sense that I have, at least in AI investing in India, is that there isn't a lot of high value companies. And at the same time, I also see some of these pioneering funds, like z 40 7z, 47 raising a lot of capital, expanding on their strategy, trying to be more aggressive. So how does both of these fit together? Okay,
I would love to understand where I would say is that 47 fits in the ecosystem I work very closely with like, like I said, my plan is to come back to India. So at the same time, I work very closely with a lot of investment funds in India, and a broader sense that I have, at least in AI investing in India, is that there isn't a lot of high value companies.

So how does both of these fit together? Okay,
S Speaker 133:26okay, I'm going to give you a bit of sense of what we've been doing. Okay, I gave you the background of how we see first one was, you know, we've been investing for 18 years now. First one was a bit of this and a bit of that more PE backwards, because tech wasn't there in India at that point in time. So if you see, most of all, we've done some bit of hospitals investment, a second Fund started giving some construct because we started doing financial services and the likes, right? And we've our first IPO came from second Fund, which is five star, which is one of the best IPO that India has seen in the last two years, right? So that's Financial Services is one of our most evolved fund so, Priyesh, you'll also understand that VCs will pick up topicality of trend depending on what's the trend that's playing out in that country, right? So financial services, by virtue of the gestation period, is more evolved in that stage, and they've done more Fs, yeah. Then comes consumer sector. But consumer is also very, very broad, right? Consumer initially was anything you're selling to consumer was consumer. But now we've divided this further into said brands. Within brands, you have category, lifestyle is different and all of it, right? Then you have E commerce, cu commerce, Ed Tech, health, tech, gaming influences. There is a lot of sector, sub sectors that will come under right, and these will also have a lot of sub topicality involved, right? You know, Ed was a big thing for three years, and health was right? Within health, you'll have very capex heavy investment to a health themed investment, right? So that's consumer. The third interest area for us has been B to B, A. From you know, growth perspective, we had, we started doing Sas three. You know, from third fund, we've done one in second fund. Also third fund was 2019 but we become more active in SAS investment when I say SAS application and horizontal SAS, right? So our strength within that, our strength has been more application, SAS, right? That's because India was building application layer for the world, right? It was more easy and naturally our focus was there, because one of the core criteria is to invest in founders based out of India building for the world, right? So, so SAS became more active, primarily after my colleague prana came onto the table. Right before that, it was SAS for different PG, let's say moengage or or, you know, we had, you know, we've closed that there was something called belong, which was more for a hiring tech and stuff like that, right? Then we have Italy, which is more SAS for travel, right? You had more horizontal SAS playing at that point in time. And then we start focusing on application layer. Pranaya is eight years fresh work, you know, and he very, very operationally involved and came on to build our SaaS playbook, right, right? And we have doubled down on SAS since then, third fund, on what? Fourth fund, almost 35% of our investment has been SaaS. Right. Then you have the B to B sector. And here a bit of SAS also comes into play. That when I say B to B, you have EV, manufacturing, supply chain, climate, space, tech, semicon, all of it, anything, but there is the deep tech element attached, where one part is semicon, but you have aI horizontal layer for some of these industrial right? I'm not talking about the middleware there here, because we're not a CapEx heavy investor. We do a medium check size of four, you know, on an average 65 to 6 million but, but we're also trying to look at those white spaces where our deals make sense. So some of our core criteria is, we like to delete deals Priyesh will like to come in early. So you will see us doing more concept deals than traction deals. So almost 70% of our dealer concept deals, which is risky because you're picking up a trend, which is untested because the category shouldn't have played out, which means that you're primarily playing out hypothesis of how it worked in us and how it worked in China, and how it potentially may work in India, right? And then you are basically taking a punt on the founders capability to build it, right? So we are a bit thesis backwards Priyesh, right? We're also opportunistic, but opportunistic guided by the thesis, right? So our starting point is we should have positive thesis around a sub sector, sector, and then that's when we will go out in the market, look for founders building in that space. Okay, coming to your specific question of where we see SAS has also evolved, you know, in the last few years, especially in India also. So we've been focusing on it, right? We don't have a we don't have a parked fund inside fund for SaaS or consumer, right? It totally, it totally, is a result of what sectors are doing a lot. We, by the way, we were the only VC who didn't do a single crypto deal, yeah, right, yes. We didn't do a lot of we didn't do ed tech at all. We did a day 12, which was a token investment, by the way, right? We did a one, 1.5 billion round, but because we couldn't just build enough conviction for that, right? So all these taken together, I think, you know, yes to answer question, is there big money coming out of it? But we've seen enough exist. Fresh work was already exists, right? But we also feel we're in the right space for smoker advantage to be spotting some of these. Almost 80% of our SaaS deals are concept deals, right? So some of these, they'll be building in still, for the one, for the first one, one and a half year, right? And then, you know, the GTM would kick in. So we're primarily in that stage where we are we I think we want to continue doing that. Application strength has been quite good. We build reference ability. We build a playbook. We have got use successful use cases, and we've got enough learning to know what to do, what not to do, where we are from a company. We would want to do more on the US India corridor, right? We would want to play more network from there versus here to there, right? Because we don't want to innovate to vacation investment. Yeah, we call it somewhere, right? But we want to have a leg into that door, right? So as I speak, Pranay Vikram, all of there in the Bay Area, we are posting a lot of people. We're meeting a lot of founders. We are in the process of also onboarding at least to one to start with it in the final level of conversation, venture partner will work very closely with founders, right, which can be GTM, to have more deflo, to also have support for founders who are seeking the support, right, but also our eyes and ears on the ground, right? So our focus would be to keep building on that right as we go. Because now that we have spinned off on our own, we don't have the dependencies and the legalities to curtail asset by that, the by the fact that there is a US arm. We don't have any US arm anymore. We are India fund globally focused, right? So that's the stage that we are in, right? We, I think, as a fund, we always said we were, you know, SAS is ahead. Is a bit late in India, right? So I think some of these sprouting will come in time. If you, if you follow, if you've been following, following semicon, it's such a big sector in the US, right? India, it isn't because the evolution stage is different. That doesn't mean it doesn't, it's not an area of interest for us, right? We will continue to be looking, but yes, I think value creation out of those investments, potentially, so will only take some time. It will not be, you know, right? So to I'll be looking at big ticket investment in the next two years, my answer is no, it will be strategic. It will be mid market m&a exits, right? But do we think some of these are big ticket exits in the long run? As answer is yes, because fund four, we have done a lot of SAS, right? And we raised one four in 2024 23 to be we started investing out in 23 and we we raised from our LP saying eight plus two. So we have a 10 year period to play some of these outs out right? But overall, I think Priyesh As a fund, professionally, personally, I think very excited by where India is there, where we can be right. It's surreal that there is a semi war happening and nobody's bothered, right? It's just so much of strength, confidence in the economy, in the leadership, in how the firm is. So I think overall, as a fund, we're very excited about the 18 years of learning. Then we feel we'll make lesser mistakes than we would have done. We feel very, very excited about where the country is inflecting, overall, everywhere, and just, you know, just a chance to have to be able to create so many opportunities in the long run, right? I don't know if this answers your question, but overall, that's the theme that we are playing out. It makes
okay, I'm going to give you a bit of sense of what we've been doing. Okay, I gave you the background of how we see first one was, you know, we've been investing for 18 years now. First one was a bit of this and a bit of that more PE backwards, because tech wasn't there in India at that point in time. So if you see, most of all, we've done some bit of hospitals investment, a second Fund started giving some construct because we started doing financial services and the likes, right? And we've our first IPO came from second Fund, which is five star, which is one of the best IPO that India has seen in the last two years, right? So that's Financial Services is one of our most evolved fund so, Priyesh, you'll also understand that VCs will pick up topicality of trend depending on what's the trend that's playing out in that country, right? So financial services, by virtue of the gestation period, is more evolved in that stage, and they've done more Fs, yeah. Then comes consumer sector. But consumer is also very, very broad, right? Consumer initially was anything you're selling to consumer was consumer. But now we've divided this further into said brands. Within brands, you have category, lifestyle is different and all of it, right? Then you have E commerce, cu commerce, Ed Tech, health, tech, gaming influences. There is a lot of sector, sub sectors that will come under right, and these will also have a lot of sub topicality involved, right? You know, Ed was a big thing for three years, and health was right? Within health, you'll have very capex heavy investment to a health themed investment, right? So that's consumer. The third interest area for us has been B to B, A. From you know, growth perspective, we had, we started doing Sas three. You know, from third fund, we've done one in second fund. Also third fund was 2019 but we become more active in SAS investment when I say SAS application and horizontal SAS, right? So our strength within that, our strength has been more application, SAS, right? That's because India was building application layer for the world, right? It was more easy and naturally our focus was there, because one of the core criteria is to invest in founders based out of India building for the world, right? So, so SAS became more active, primarily after my colleague prana came onto the table. Right before that, it was SAS for different PG, let's say moengage or or, you know, we had, you know, we've closed that there was something called belong, which was more for a hiring tech and stuff like that, right? Then we have Italy, which is more SAS for travel, right? You had more horizontal SAS playing at that point in time. And then we start focusing on application layer. Pranaya is eight years fresh work, you know, and he very, very operationally involved and came on to build our SaaS playbook, right, right? And we have doubled down on SAS since then, third fund, on what? Fourth fund, almost 35% of our investment has been SaaS. Right. Then you have the B to B sector. And here a bit of SAS also comes into play. That when I say B to B, you have EV, manufacturing, supply chain, climate, space, tech, semicon, all of it, anything, but there is the deep tech element attached, where one part is semicon, but you have aI horizontal layer for some of these industrial right? I'm not talking about the middleware there here, because we're not a CapEx heavy investor. We do a medium check size of four, you know, on an average 65 to 6 million but, but we're also trying to look at those white spaces where our deals make sense. So some of our core criteria is, we like to delete deals Priyesh will like to come in early. So you will see us doing more concept deals than traction deals. So almost 70% of our dealer concept deals, which is risky because you're picking up a trend, which is untested because the category shouldn't have played out, which means that you're primarily playing out hypothesis of how it worked in us and how it worked in China, and how it potentially may work in India, right? And then you are basically taking a punt on the founders capability to build it, right? So we are a bit thesis backwards Priyesh, right? We're also opportunistic, but opportunistic guided by the thesis, right? So our starting point is we should have positive thesis around a sub sector, sector, and then that's when we will go out in the market, look for founders building in that space. Okay, coming to your specific question of where we see SAS has also evolved, you know, in the last few years, especially in India also. So we've been focusing on it, right? We don't have a we don't have a parked fund inside fund for SaaS or consumer, right? It totally, it totally, is a result of what sectors are doing a lot. We, by the way, we were the only VC who didn't do a single crypto deal, yeah, right, yes. We didn't do a lot of we didn't do ed tech at all. We did a day 12, which was a token investment, by the way, right? We did a one, 1.5 billion round, but because we couldn't just build enough conviction for that, right? So all these taken together, I think, you know, yes to answer question, is there big money coming out of it? But we've seen enough exist. Fresh work was already exists, right? But we also feel we're in the right space for smoker advantage to be spotting some of these. Almost 80% of our SaaS deals are concept deals, right? So some of these, they'll be building in still, for the one, for the first one, one and a half year, right? And then, you know, the GTM would kick in. So we're primarily in that stage where we are we I think we want to continue doing that. Application strength has been quite good. We build reference ability. We build a playbook. We have got use successful use cases, and we've got enough learning to know what to do, what not to do, where we are from a company. We would want to do more on the US India corridor, right? We would want to play more network from there versus here to there, right? Because we don't want to innovate to vacation investment. Yeah, we call it somewhere, right? But we want to have a leg into that door, right? So as I speak, Pranay Vikram, all of there in the Bay Area, we are posting a lot of people. We're meeting a lot of founders. We are in the process of also onboarding at least to one to start with it in the final level of conversation, venture partner will work very closely with founders, right, which can be GTM, to have more deflo, to also have support for founders who are seeking the support, right, but also our eyes and ears on the ground, right? So our focus would be to keep building on that right as we go. Because now that we have spinned off on our own, we don't have the dependencies and the legalities to curtail asset by that, the by the fact that there is a US arm. We don't have any US arm anymore. We are India fund globally focused, right? So that's the stage that we are in, right? We, I think, as a fund, we always said we were, you know, SAS is ahead. Is a bit late in India, right?

We will continue to be looking, but yes, I think value creation out of those investments, potentially, so will only take some time. It will not be, you know, right? So to I'll be looking at big ticket investment in the next two years, my answer is no, it will be strategic. It will be mid market m&a exits, right? But do we think some of these are big ticket exits in the long run? As answer is yes, because fund four, we have done a lot of SAS, right? And we raised one four in 2024 23 to be we started investing out in 23 and we we raised from our LP saying eight plus two. So we have a 10 year period to play some of these outs out right? But overall, I think Priyesh As a fund, professionally, personally, I think very excited by where India is there, where we can be right. It's surreal that there is a semi war happening and nobody's bothered, right? It's just so much of strength, confidence in the economy, in the leadership, in how the firm is.

okay, I'm going to give you a bit of sense of what we've been doing. Okay, I gave you the background of how we see first one was, you know, we've been investing for 18 years now. First one was a bit of this and a bit of that more PE backwards, because tech wasn't there in India at that point in time. So if you see, most of all, we've done some bit of hospitals investment, a second Fund started giving some construct because we started doing financial services and the likes, right? And we've our first IPO came from second Fund, which is five star, which is one of the best IPO that India has seen in the last two years, right?

We have got use successful use cases, and we've got enough learning to know what to do, what not to do, where we are from a company. We would want to do more on the US India corridor, right? We would want to play more network from there versus here to there, right? Because we don't want to innovate to vacation investment. Yeah, we call it somewhere, right? But we want to have a leg into that door, right? So as I speak, Pranay Vikram, all of there in the Bay Area, we are posting a lot of people. We're meeting a lot of founders. We are in the process of also onboarding at least to one to start with it in the final level of conversation, venture partner will work very closely with founders, right, which can be GTM, to have more deflo, to also have support for founders who are seeking the support, right, but also our eyes and ears on the ground, right?

S Speaker 246:20very exciting Rupali, I think on the second one, I do see very similar thesis with a few more pioneering Indian funds. I work very closely with peak XV, SIG, powerhouse capital. And as a part of my preparation to move back to India, I'm trying to sort of flex more on this muscle, as in, can I add value to some of these funds today, now that my deal flow is here in India, so I would love to also, even if this discussion is not timely, or if there's not a fit, happy to continue this discussion if there is a fit, if you feel that, but if not, at the same time, would love to sort of contribute a lot of my deal flow Back to the company. Personally sitting here, I do feel I see a difference when I source deals with Indian based founders. There's definitely a natural connect. And I would say a 30% of my entire deal pipeline is with Indian one of the founders are an Indian based founder, probably a IIT background. Did a master's in us now is building in us. So happy to route some of those deals back to the fund. No, what

And as a part of my preparation to move back to India, I'm trying to sort of flex more on this muscle, as in, can I add value to some of these funds today, now that my deal flow is here in India, so I would love to also, even if this discussion is not timely, or if there's not a fit, happy to continue this discussion if there is a fit, if you feel that, but if not, at the same time, would love to sort of contribute a lot of my deal flow Back to the company. Personally sitting here, I do feel I see a difference when I source deals with Indian based founders. There's definitely a natural connect. And I would say a 30% of my entire deal pipeline is with Indian one of the founders are an Indian based founder, probably a IIT background. Did a master's in us now is building in us.

I'm happy to do that. What I'm also doing is I'm dropping my hand phone number here, right? Ball of friends understand. And I think good, bad, ugly, and more so ugly than the good ones to be very candid, right? And yeah, and if this is something that in some form fits into what you would want to do, right, I would definitely love to spend more time.
