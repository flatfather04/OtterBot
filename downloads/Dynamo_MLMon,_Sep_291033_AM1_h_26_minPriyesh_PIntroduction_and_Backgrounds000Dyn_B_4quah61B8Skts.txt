S Speaker 32:09Michael pleasure, meeting you. I'm Priyesh. I'm a Senior Associate here in the team. Been with the team for about year and a half. Prior to that, I've spent my early career working with a bunch of different startups, and then, more recently, about three years in venture, I've spent time with Menlo Ventures and Morpheus in the past, and currently working with deep work on our AI infra DevOps focus areas. Nice to

S Speaker 25:23next level, right? So I think, like, that was my mission, right? I was, like, when I was basically on my PhD, this was the last, but like, one chapter of my thesis, right? Like, how do you get the size of neural networks to reduce without compromising performance? And that ended up becoming, like, what we needed to get things running on device.

S Speaker 15:41So one data point I remember from dynamos, you know, Genesis was, it was built on federated learning, yes, right? And it was more about like, how do you separate learning? How do you do PII and privacy data, and how do you, you know, so, how has that morphed into what you're able to do today, because federated learning has also been around for quite some time. This was pre Gen AI, federated learning, yes. So can you take us through that journey from a product standpoint, and what resonated with the market for them to adopt this whole Hey, let me put guardrails on the device and on prem and then in the cloud, and maybe if you have a case study, or if you have some product slides, yeah,

S Speaker 26:26with you guys. When you guys are free, please take a look at that, right? I have like more that we're making public in the coming days, but I think the most important reason why these large companies like work with us is because of two things, right? So when we started federated learning, that was, like, also my thesis. So I was obviously your thesis was better. So I think there was two things which I always wanted to never change. Like, one was like, I didn't want to do, like, something that was out of the privacy security compliance space, because that was my background that makes sense. And federated training enables you to, like, train these models without actually having like, the data aggregated in like one place, right? But still, the challenge which we were doing from like, like, 2022 2023 when we're still doing this, was like, how can you steal information from neural networks? That was still a fundamental thing, which, like, the last eight times, right? So that we just saw became much more easier with llms, right? So, like, the whole point of iterated learning plus differential privacy, which we were trying to show, was, like, hey, from a neural network you cannot steal information, right? Or like your like, the data is private the model, and then you cannot relearn from the model. But with the advent of like, llms, when you were, like, breaking these models for fun, right? Like last week, we stole, like, no such production API keys, right? So we just saw that this was like a space which is like, very, very easy to extract information from, right? And what we saw was that, like, people were willing to pay for this, right? So that is where this guardians. We were like, Okay, why don't we do the defense? Defense is basically, like, whatever you don't want the model to do. How do you stop that, rather than controlling and forcing people to train a model in a certain way, why don't you put something in between and move from?

S Speaker 18:19So you move from, because I remember, the genesis was training llms to be able to do federated learning right now to now you're more focused on absorbing, controlling, securing and maybe protecting, protecting
So you move from, because I remember, the genesis was training llms to be able to do federated learning right now to now you're more focused on absorbing, controlling, securing and maybe protecting, protecting
So you move from, because I remember, the genesis was training llms to be able to do federated learning right now to now you're more focused on absorbing, controlling, securing and maybe protecting, protecting
So you move from, because I remember, the genesis was training llms to be able to do federated learning right now to now you're more focused on absorbing, controlling, securing and maybe protecting, protecting
S Speaker 28:33exactly because this is also a model which we all right. This was like a foundation model which we train that has the capability to accept any kind of policy information and self learn based on that policy information, generate synthetic data, like, continuously update, right? And that is what we were able to get into like, very well. Like, again, as I said, as much as we are focused on that, even when we're doing federated training, we did on device right, because we were able to reduce the size of these models to get it running on the device. But then now we just saw a much better fit, where we were making revenue. But it's still, like you say, right, from like, how do you realize the network to, like, make it good for specific tasks, right? That's kind of like the thesis. And then obviously we just like, yeah, started to break down on this.
exactly because this is also a model which we all right. This was like a foundation model which we train that has the capability to accept any kind of policy information and self learn based on that policy information, generate synthetic data, like, continuously update, right?

S Speaker 19:20Got it. Got it. That's super interesting, you know? And then thanks for bridging that gap from, you know what, yeah, before, to now. And when did you launch this whole post, post deployment monitoring, or post deployment eval, or guardrails product? And the second piece is, I mentioned emails. Do you do any bit of like, the quality of AI systems that you're building? Are there any benchmarks that you publish, or mostly
Got it. Got it. That's super interesting, you know? And then thanks for bridging that gap from, you know what, yeah, before, to now.

S Speaker 29:44we are focused around, like the security, privacy side of things. But then, of course, we do hallucinations as well, and that's kind of becoming the performance benchmarks which our customers are using. Yeah, but it's more around, like. Yeah, the robustness of your model, kind of, this is the place and the vulnerabilities and the robustness of your models that's
we are focused around, like the security, privacy side of things. But then, of course, we do hallucinations as well, and that's kind of becoming the performance benchmarks which our customers are using. Yeah, but it's more around, like.

S Speaker 110:05just like, protecting from jailbreaks or prompt injection breaks.
just like, protecting from jailbreaks or prompt injection breaks.
just like, protecting from jailbreaks or prompt injection breaks.
just like, protecting from jailbreaks or prompt injection breaks.
S Speaker 210:09Like, yeah, prompt injections where it's like, where is like algebra taking respect to like, request contacts, things like
Like, yeah, prompt injections where it's like, where is like algebra taking respect to like, request contacts, things like
Like, yeah, prompt injections where it's like, where is like algebra taking respect to like, request contacts, things like
Like, yeah, prompt injections where it's like, where is like algebra taking respect to like, request contacts, things like
S Speaker 110:16that, got it, got it. And this is driven by API integration to applications. Or you do network level, like, what, what is your idea
that, got it, got it. And this is driven by API integration to applications. Or you do network level, like, what, what is your idea
that, got it, got it. And this is driven by API integration to applications. Or you do network level, like, what, what is your idea
that, got it, got it. And this is driven by API integration to applications. Or you do network level, like, what, what is your idea
S Speaker 210:24we have like, so for example, like, there's like, obviously, like API access, which is what an expedient or like a PayPal for their internal systems, like, they have their own, like, chatbots, models, everything, right? So they don't need to buy that from another person. So for all those things, like APIs, we just deployed as like a Kubernetes solution within their environment, and then they can process with an environment API based access everything is under their control, right? So classic enterprise deployment of like Google tools based packages. And then we also have like integrations with someone like a Zscaler, right? And that is for like, there's like Zscaler pipeline already that is connecting to, like, all their network traffic, so that they can access public Internet, whatever. But then, like, dynamos, guardrails sit on top of them, right? So there's a proxy layer where visited. And then the final pieces are on device, right? So that means that they can run these guardrails on your device itself, right? Like, yeah, as an app, what is that?
we have like, so for example, like, there's like, obviously, like API access, which is what an expedient or like a PayPal for their internal systems, like, they have their own, like, chatbots, models, everything, right?

So that means that they can run these guardrails on your device itself, right? Like, yeah, as an app, what is that?
S Speaker 111:20What does that piece mean? When you say, on device, you can run cart rails. So this from an architecture point of view, if you were talking Kubernetes deployment, is it like a container and SDK or like, what? What is from an architecture point of view, enabling you to run guardrails on the device?
What does that piece mean? When you say, on device, you can run cart rails. So this from an architecture point of view, if you were talking Kubernetes deployment, is it like a container and SDK or like, what? What is from an architecture point of view, enabling you to run guardrails on the device?

S Speaker 211:38Yeah. So basically, we have like different ways, right? So one, for example, okay, simple browser extension, right? But the other suggest, be like an application installed in your laptop that can control any application in your laptop, right? So the guardrail is being like, installed as an application in your laptop, like, will install any software, and then it has the control to like, so if you're like so if you're like, a large company, right, financial institution, you're giving out, like, 10s of 1000s of laptops to your employees, and you're doing like, say, like, an upgrade, whatever. Then basically, you're now forcing your employees to make sure that they cannot use chat GPT to ask, like, oh, how do I become a millionaire by train this stock? Right? Technically, if your equipment tax, your team cannot ask these questions to extract answers, right? So can even now control that within your direct like employees laptop, right? So that means it's running on the device. Same thing with drones, right? So if I'm controlling the drones, I need to be able to, like, run these things on the device itself,
Yeah. So basically, we have like different ways, right? So one, for example, okay, simple browser extension, right? But the other suggest, be like an application installed in your laptop that can control any application in your laptop, right? So the guardrail is being like, installed as an application in your laptop, like, will install any software, and then it has the control to like, so if you're like so if you're like, a large company, right, financial institution, you're giving out, like, 10s of 1000s of laptops to your employees, and you're doing like, say, like, an upgrade, whatever.

But the other suggest, be like an application installed in your laptop that can control any application in your laptop, right? So the guardrail is being like, installed as an application in your laptop, like, will install any software, and then it has the control to like, so if you're like so if you're like, a large company, right, financial institution, you're giving out, like, 10s of 1000s of laptops to your employees, and you're doing like, say, like, an upgrade, whatever. Then basically, you're now forcing your employees to make sure that they cannot use chat GPT to ask, like, oh, how do I become a millionaire by train this stock? Right? Technically, if your equipment tax, your team cannot ask these questions to extract answers, right? So can even now control that within your direct like employees laptop, right? So that means it's running on the device. Same thing with drones, right? So if I'm controlling the drones, I need to be able to, like, run these things on the device itself,
Yeah. So basically, we have like different ways, right? So one, for example, okay, simple browser extension, right?

so that, like, I can, like, control like God.
so that, like, I can, like, control like God.
so that, like, I can, like, control like God.

So it might be like a browser extension or an agent or an application.
So it might be like a browser extension or an agent or an application.
So it might be like a browser extension or an agent or an application.
S Speaker 212:42The exigence is an example, right? But it could be anything. It could be a direct agent. It could be a direct application in your laptop. So we've done, like, yeah, everything in that space, and then yeah, you can, like, read more in our

S Speaker 113:44sure, and that's fine, and that's fine. We can, we can, of course, circle back and when you talk to like, let's say Experian and others, right there are a bunch of other observability tools, like data dog and Dynatrace. And then there are like, these tools, like arise and Gallio and yeah. So where do you fit in, in that, in that,
sure, and that's fine, and that's fine.

S Speaker 214:05yeah, we don't really compete with any of those guys, right? Like, we have plugins with, like, Splunk data, or you can do whatever, right? We are basically saying that, like, this is a one place where you can control all your like, policies, security compliance, like, like, like, whatever those things, and ensure that like, your AI applications could be like, again, right? Like an agent would be a neural network, like an LLM could be a chat bot, like, whatever you have. We'll ensure that these systems are secure and compliant with respect to like, any kind of like attacks or like, with respect to like, any kind of like, non compliant things you don't want to allow. That is where we are coming in. So we are like the final layer, which they I mean, we are like the core layer, where they need to make sure things are ready to go to production, right, and in like, real time when, like, people across the globe are, like, using their platforms, everything goes to us in the form of, like, anything, right? Like, it could be like a proxy. It could. Be like an API. It could be like on device, like, agent, application, whatever. So that is when we are like coming in, right? But that doesn't mean that trying to replace like data dots, like for observability features that no we have like integrations with them so that, like, say, for example, our like metrics can easily be transported.

S Speaker 115:19Yeah. And for this, let's say, if I'm Qualcomm and I'm deploying your solution, I'm building my own internal chat for HR. Let's say HR employees to query. I will use Dynamo for as a proxy or a gateway, right? To filter all the queries, both inbound and outbound. Yes, number one, right? Then there is a customer facing chatbot that people come on the website and they are interacting with, Qualcomm or, or, let's say I'm using cursor, or I'm using writer, right? Like, how would you identify all these different applications? So do that? Do, do I, as an owner, have to now allow Dynamo to be, you know, to be interfacing some of these applications. So there's a visibility aspect to it, and then there is control already
Yeah. And for this, let's say, if I'm Qualcomm and I'm deploying your solution, I'm building my own internal chat for HR. Let's say HR employees to query.

16:37This is like, spending
This is like, spending
This is like, spending
This is like, spending
S Speaker 216:40some time there and then, like, it's kind of like, now, like, Now, any application in an Intel powered laptop, whatever you want, to take one piece of control, which the company say, for example, if that is selling to JP market, hypothetically speaking, right? Like, then JP markets, like purchasing whatever these like on device, like stuff, right? They could be, like, upgraded as a software package. They could just, like, rebuild, push it to their like systems, of their like employees, but everything is happening on their Intel hardware, and then, like, basically making sure that the guardrails are, like, embedded within that system. So that means that now they can run these things. Dynamo is not even needed anymore right now, from like, say, for example, none of our support guys are going to be there, right? Everything is done within, like, JP Morgan's ecosystem. They have full control over what policies they want to be pushing to everyone's laptops. What are they people trying to do something that they're not supposed to do? This is a pre

S Speaker 218:49like large enterprises, right? We only work with, like, I mean, at this point, like, we only work with someone in their Vegas, like, six or seven figures, right? Like, only large companies can, like, afford to do that. So I think, yeah, that's the

S Speaker 120:20That's great to know. Listen, I think what you're addressing and solving for is a big pain point within enterprises, and we are seeing this internally ourselves. And the device angle is super interesting to me, because not a lot of companies do that what you're trying to do. And I like the federated learning tech that you've leveraged to actually solve for something that's pretty apparent in production today. So I think the timing, the tech, and you know, you, you're getting the right tailwinds behind you. What I would, I would propose as a potential next step. So we've, we've, the last investment I made was an in between round. It was potentially a safe that translates or converts into the next round, right? And given the kind of growth you are seeing, I would like to offer if, if there is any you can discuss this with your board as well, if there's any openness to, yeah, putting together something around maybe, like a small safe that converts in the next round, which will be end of this year or early next

And given the kind of growth you are seeing, I would like to offer if, if there is any you can discuss this with your board as well, if there's any openness to, yeah, putting together something around maybe, like a small safe that converts in the next round, which will be end of this year or early next
S Speaker 221:17year. I mean, so next, like two months have just been like, good, like, hyper focused, like, making sure we get the other deals done before. Usually, like, customers go out after a Thanksgiving break. It's hard.

I'll just say that we could chart a potential roadmap of how things could look like, right? And and bring in some of the BU folks as to how, how much emphasis or how much of a priority they would put on this particular

And, you know, the journey forward. And, like I said, the vehicle, right? I mean, this, if it all this resonates, and this takes off, I think, you know, having Qualcomm on the device side, this will be super interesting and great partnership, even if it doesn't materialize. And what I'm trying to say is, I'm not going to come in and propose that. We'll, you know, the partnership will pay off in the first year, right? It might take longer than that, but I think the potential is there. So let's, let's continue engaging. Yeah, I'll let Priyesh Any any departing thoughts, any questions on your end?

S Speaker 324:26Yeah, I just had a couple of quick questions. Vaikunt on the policy enforcement engine as well. Specifically, you mentioned this. This seems to be a very key part of the entire stack. But how do you enforce policy? Do you need a corpus of ground truth data. You also mentioned you have a synthetic data engine. How does that entirely work?
Yeah, I just had a couple of quick questions. Vaikunt on the policy enforcement engine as well. Specifically, you mentioned this. This seems to be a very key part of the entire stack. But how do you enforce policy? Do you need a corpus of ground truth data. You also mentioned you have a synthetic data engine. How does that entirely work?

But how do you enforce policy? Do you need a corpus of ground truth data. You also mentioned you have a synthetic data engine. How does that entirely work?
S Speaker 224:45Good question, right? So, long story short, you say, for example, you're like, typing in, like, Japanese or English, like whatever. I say that I do not give legal advice, right? Say that's your policy description. But the thing is that, like, how do you define legal advice? I'm. Is unique to like you. You need to you need to deeper, right? So imagine like, the way experience defines legal advice is different from the way PayPal defines legal advice. Or even like experience Europe, the way they define is different from the way the American team defines it, right? So that means that like, you need to have, like, some allowed behaviors disallowed behaviors, or like what's allowed and not allowed. So based on this, we have, like, our foundation guardrail model, which we which we built from scratch, that would like, take this as input and then generating the synthetic data for all the edge cases, right? And then there's the human in the loop, like, obviously feedback that would like, continuously, like hydrate on this model, and then that is what is going out as the final guardrail model, which they're putting in production. So that means that, like, whatever cause you're discovering in that language, if it takes, like, it's impossible for a human being to cover the entire spectrum, right? And even if they cover the entire spectrum, say it takes, like, 10,000 hours, what we're saying is, with like, Dynamo, there's a human in the loop as well, of course, but you can, like, do this in like, two hours, right? Because we just have like, a much wider, like coverage that allows you to, like, do this. But then also, it's not a rule based system, because the easiest thing is, is a rule based system, you can easily break it, and that's what we are doing like on a daily basis. So the whole thesis here is that, like, we have this guardrail model which is which learns the context. So that means that even if you're like, doing like 1520, queries it has, like the context or like multi tiered engine, and that is what is providing them the defense here,
Good question, right? So, long story short, you say, for example, you're like, typing in, like, Japanese or English, like whatever. I say that I do not give legal advice, right? Say that's your policy description. But the thing is that, like, how do you define legal advice? I'm. Is unique to like you. You need to you need to deeper, right?

So the whole thesis here is that, like, we have this guardrail model which is which learns the context.
