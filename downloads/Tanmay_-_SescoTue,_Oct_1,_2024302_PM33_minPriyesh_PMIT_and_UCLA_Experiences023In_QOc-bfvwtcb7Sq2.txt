S Speaker 20:39Okay, okay, yeah, I was going through your profile. I realized you graduated this year as well, right?

S Speaker 31:10say I had couple of options as to whether I should pursue a master of finance or an MBA couple years. But I realized that I wanted to stay in finance, coming from finance, and it didn't really make sense to offer MBA, especially if I wanted to be on the quantitative side of things. Yeah. So in that regard, I think the program was quite good, at least at MIT, you don't have to take all the business school courses. You can take anything at the School of Engineering as a pretty good at least for the forms that I was targeting and MIT in general,

S Speaker 21:58was good man, like I went to UCLA, because I wanted to be in a bigger city ecosystem. And I guess that bet paid off, to some extent, really got me connected to a lot of VC funds. I wanted to make a pivot into Vc, and that's why I decided to pursue an MBA. And I guess overall, it was a great experience, just the diversity of people I could meet the kind of the different industries of students that were in our class, it was quite amazing. And then especially in LA UCLA, kind of holds a very strong place in that entire ecosystem. So that allowed me to sort of network with a lot of funds, make my own network, reach out to the right guys make sure that I have a good chance of entering into Vc. So eventually it worked well, and I'm glad where I am right now.

S Speaker 32:51No, that's great. I think at least for the VC point of view, I think the best course is probably better than these course. Yeah,
No, that's great. I think at least for the VC point of view, I think the best course is probably better than these course. Yeah,

S Speaker 22:58yeah. Agreed, totally, man, so than the reason I wanted to talk to you today was, I'll give you the broader context about this company we are looking at. But so there's this company we are due diligence in on it. It's foreign potential seed investment, and these, this is a company which is creating weather forecasting models for now, and they plan to, down the line, do a lot more with it. But for now, they are using that weather forecasting model as an API to give it to energy trading desks and a lot of hedge funds and specialized energy trading houses, and letting these energy houses sort of use that to better trade, in a sense. Now, I do come from energy to some extent. I back in India, I was working in a clean tech firm, and we would set up wind and solar farms, and we'll supply power for 1525, years horizon. But I don't understand the energy trading market as much, so I want to get a sense of how important do you think, whether forecasting is for this industry, or maybe, like, maybe taking a step back from there, how big do you see this industry is, and what kind of players do you actually see playing you

S Speaker 34:19Okay, so start from, like on the very basic front on energy trading, when we talk about weather, that is only relevant in electricity trading. So energy trading in general will also involve, let's say, your crude, your gas and commodity trading. But typically that is very well structured. Does not really need better data per se, so it only comes into account when you are creating electricity. Yeah, I'm not sure if there is anything otherwise, probably in agriculture, but not as relevant, is what I would say. And then in electricity, at least in us, the way it works is that you have two kinds of markets. The first is what would traditionally be called a spot market, slightly different from a general commodity spot market, but I'll explain that. And the second is the futures market. Now, by the spot market, what I mean is that, let's say there's a ISO. I forget the full form, but you can look

S Speaker 35:36like that. So there are these different ISOs which are operating, let's say electrical or regulating the electrical trading in different regions. So for example, there's skyso, which is California, ISO, then similarly, there's bjm, there is niso and so on.
like that. So there are these different ISOs which are operating, let's say electrical or regulating the electrical trading in different regions. So for example, there's skyso, which is California, ISO, then similarly, there's bjm, there is niso and so on.

S Speaker 35:59essentially determine a what the demand is looking like for the next day or for today as well, and then connect electricity producers with electricity users. What us decided, I think, in 02 or 04 is that they want to open this market to more players. So what now happened is that they allowed virtual traders to bid on these markets to improve the pricing. Otherwise, what would happen is that if there is one big electricity producer, they can underprice so that they kick the competition out of the point out of you, and that becomes problematic, because, let's say you are a national gas bank, but you're not the biggest you. If you see that you cannot match the price which the competitor is offering, that means you'll have to produce analogs, because shutting down the plant is actually not an option. Shutting down the plant probably cost you both, and they realize that this is probably not as good. So their idea was that if financial intermediaries enter the market, then what they'll do is they'll see whatever inaccuracies are there. So let's say, if someone is undercutting the price, what they'll do is they'll buy the electricity somewhere else and then transport it here, because there is a grid network, and they'll close it out. So then at the end, the price would price should reach its optimal thing, right?

S Speaker 37:45futures are cash set. That is, it's essentially just a capital contract. So what it is saying is that, let's say you have older September future. You went long at certain price. The second price of this is calculated at the end of September, during September as well. So essentially it's the average of every five minute interval electricity price in that region. It can become more detailed, but essentially that is so at the end, whatever is this average price compared to what you wanted that and the difference of that, you'll get the cash. My belief is that the future is trading. You usually don't need the better data as much because you are operating at a frequency which is very infrequent. So let's say, if you're judging you for a month back, anything that you're going to extract out. To extract out of your better or accurate weather forecast is probably only going to be a day in frequency. There was a heat wave, it impacted one particular day, and that prices spike. But when you're looking at the month, it's going to average out, so it's not going to change too much. Yeah. So someone who's operating on these futures, they usually end up operating in all of the US regions and then all of the Europe regions. So they develop more basic strategies which don't really use weather data, or don't actually try to predict the electricity price, but more from a fundamental point of view, that okay, if the fuel price is rising, then maybe I should buy electricity or things like that. The spot market is more interesting. So for example, the form that I was interning at before, which is Cesco, yeah, they have their own in house meteorology. So they had about five or five or six people who purchased weather specialists, and their job was to identify all of these three models which exist in weather, if there is any inaccuracy of that. And do you have any prediction of how the actual weather is going to change? And all that becomes important for various reasons. For example, you need the cloud cover forecast or wind forecast for your renewables, which now is a big deal, at least for sale, especially for California, because they are making a big push on that. Maybe not so much for other regions yet. I think in other regions still, natural gas is the most dominant, and those are the couple. And then for temperature, for example, is important, because if the predicted temperature is it's one Celsius higher than previous, then your electricity demand is going to be other, and then it's just a supply demand.

S Speaker 311:32it is limited compared to the number of people who operate on the futures market, simply because futures, as I said, in a crude manner, is just a gambling contract. You could buy as much as you want, and you won't be impacting the actual US National Grid, because at the end, it just matters as to what the final price is, and you'll get the difference in cash. You don't have to supply electricity if you can't meet the demand, or if, let's say there is no one on the other side, you don't have to buy, you don't have to which, in let's say case of the crude or natural gas, if you are unable to settle it out, then you will have to take delivery of food, which can be cumbersome. That is not their futures, electricity, right on the spot market, things are a bit different. Let's say if you're trading on the day ahead market is essentially just trading tomorrow's electricity, guys, if a financial player is buying electricity the day ahead market, then he needs to offset that so he always needs to have a spread position, because technically, they cannot take delivery. You are not producing electricity, and you are not supplying electricity. So that means you will always have to be in offset. So that means you what you could do is you could buy tomorrow's electricity, and then tomorrow, in the real time market, you can sell. If it is more important that balances, and whatever is the price, you will have to do that. So you could lose money on that, but you could also make money. The problem here is that all of these ISOs regulate who can enter this market, so there is a barrier to entry. If tomorrow you want to trade on the spot market you can right because effectively, you are impacting the US, national grid, which can have difficulties on, let's say, the national interest and so on. If the grid goes offline because of something, you might go bankrupt, but also things shut down which is problematic for them, which they don't want. But over the last few years, a lot of hedge funds have started entering this split which were not there before. So I think still, the major player is probably DC energy, which is a firm which does on its own on any given day, they probably hold about 50% of liquidity for contracts for different markets. Cisco is also, I think, one of the major players in some markets, not all in spot, also, there is a segregation, but there are few forms which are doing this. There are a few other trading houses, which started after, for example, Cesco has been doing it since something so it has been there for a long time, and they have been profitable because of that. A lot of the other firms started following. And now, as the market has become a bit more mature, because there are more players, many of your hedge funds, like, let's say talyasney is doing this. Jake Street is doing this, and they have been hiring people for the power trading test. So a lot more players are now entering this, which suggests that maybe it's going to become much more mature. Might have more players in the future. I don't know what these new players are actually using to do it, because so far, what I've seen is they would hire some trader who already has experience in it, and he will work on that. But if they don't have proper weather data, all of your exchanges actually provides weather data as well. So if you are trading with ice, ice provides you weather data for free, if you are suggested for the power port, and if that is enough for them, then that's okay. If they need more detail, then us. Yeah. There's also the case that it could be that the weather portal that you are looking at is much better than what ice provides are much easier to access, which could have some value, but I'm not aware of what is actually being used and whether it's going to add value.
it is limited compared to the number of people who operate on the futures market, simply because futures, as I said, in a crude manner, is just a gambling contract. You could buy as much as you want, and you won't be impacting the actual US National Grid, because at the end, it just matters as to what the final price is, and you'll get the difference in cash. You don't have to supply electricity if you can't meet the demand, or if, let's say there is no one on the other side, you don't have to buy, you don't have to which, in let's say case of the crude or natural gas, if you are unable to settle it out, then you will have to take delivery of food, which can be cumbersome.

S Speaker 316:14quite a few, I would say. So Cesco had actually two revisions, one which was focused on the fundamental way of trade, which kind of evolved into saying, Okay, what the actual grid is. These two points are connected, and I should trade power on these two points, but I know some electricity exists. And then the second, which was a newer division, which I was part of, was more quantitatively oriented. They were trying to use physics laws to actually model electricity price and so on.

S Speaker 316:55trading across the US, on different markets. So for example, PGM was their biggest. So that had four or five traders, and then, not first, let's say New England was not very big, so they didn't have any trade for New England and so on. But there are these different traders. And then there would be traders who would be trading, let's say, some spot contracts on each of these markets. So there are some days when these contracts are more active, and then they work hard on those days. I don't know the totalship, but let's say 50 traders is a safe estimate. But Cesco is also like AUM cap, that is every year they work on a fixed AUM of 100 and 50 million 50 million, right? There are others who are much bigger, but, yeah, I think for them, money was not really the concern.

17:52They were making more than 100% on every year.
S Speaker 217:58Yeah, and that's one of the factors that is getting us excited about this company is that there seems to be a lot of willingness to pay in case this weather forecast does add value to these traders, and the value proposition that these guys are promising today is that they can get weather forecasts more accurate than the current state of the Art, which is something that comes out from the European Union, ECW, MF, and they can get it faster to the traders, which seems like a strong value proposition. That is something I'm planning trying to validate right now. So, so like, do you have an estimate? I mean, this might be a slightly vague question, but do you have an estimate on how much, or, let's say, and a weather forecast one hour ahead than what an IC would provide you? Would that move the needle for these energy traders?
Yeah, and that's one of the factors that is getting us excited about this company is that there seems to be a lot of willingness to pay in case this weather forecast does add value to these traders, and the value proposition that these guys are promising today is that they can get weather forecasts more accurate than the current state of the Art, which is something that comes out from the European Union, ECW, MF, and they can get it faster to the traders, which seems like a strong value proposition.

S Speaker 321:14also power providers, they also look to trade in The spot market because, for example, if you're a electricity generator, let's say your own national gas plant, then you have to sell your electricity on the spot market. So how it works is that you would bid, saying that I can produce x units at this cost, and then the next x units at this cost and so on, something like a marginal utility curve of how they can produce electricity, and they need to optimal, optimally, send that out so that they get their quota of electricity to be generated. If they send out too high prices, they might not get enough. If they send out two less then they might have to generate extra utility, and they might not have the fuel to generate that, so they need to place their hedges to order natural gas. Now, I don't think utility companies are that advanced where they are using weather data, but there could be a case for them to use it, because most of the people who are working at Cesco had some background coming from UK companies and trading for UT companies.

S Speaker 222:28Interesting, interesting. And then I guess I have two questions for you, and I won't take a lot of your time beyond that. Do you see the US market as the biggest one? Or do you see way more bigger companies in the European market? I've come across a couple of trading firms like danske commodities in Europe in commodities, and seems like they have strong AUMs. So is that a bigger market? I um,
Interesting, interesting. And then I guess I have two questions for you, and I won't take a lot of your time beyond that. Do you see the US market as the biggest one?

S Speaker 323:04I actually don't know if it's a bigger market to be sorted. It has been tradable in the Europe for a long, lot longer, which is slightly advantageous. But also, I think in Europe, you can trade for each country separately. So you can create Spanish power. You can create French power. And there are some inefficiencies there, like, for example, in us, if suddenly Kaiso or California has an energy shortage, they can still import electricity from, let's say, the mid continent or Texas or somewhere else. There it is produced for cheap. It's not as easy in France and Spain, you can't exactly do that very easy. So that creates some additional inefficiencies. So if a financial provider has a great connection, and then they know that they can buy it, or they can sell it here, or they might make money. So they have these patterns which are better set, and then us. I think another issue that people face is that some of the ISOs are not data limits, or they you cannot trade on them. So I think, for example, south east, that is Florida, Georgia, and all those states you cannot create. So now you don't know how much they are generating. You also don't know how much is being imported from, right which creates kind of a black hole. But I would still say that US is much bigger than these forms, and with renewables being added on, it creates an interesting problem, because now you need weather data more to predict renewable generation, because solar and wind, solar and wind are directly related to your weather data. If cloud cover is high, that means solar generation will

So they have these patterns which are better set, and then us. I think another issue that people face is that some of the ISOs are not data limits, or they you cannot trade on them. So I think, for example, south east, that is Florida, Georgia, and all those states you cannot create. So now you don't know how much they are generating. You also don't know how much is being imported from, right which creates kind of a black hole. But I would still say that US is much bigger than these forms, and with renewables being added on, it creates an interesting problem, because now you need weather data more to predict renewable generation, because solar and wind, solar and wind are directly related to your weather data. If cloud cover is high, that means solar generation will
S Speaker 325:10not there, that means wind generation. And there are times like I can even show it through. Place you
not there, that means wind generation. And there are times like I can even show it through. Place you

S Speaker 225:51Not yet? No, yes, I can see it now.

S Speaker 326:06So if you notice, this is just saying that how much is going to be the electricity demand today, their outlook, and then the dash lines are day ahead of yesterday, so at T minus one. So what today is electricity. This is what the predicted price was, but actually came in lower than that. But what I wanted to show was this. So green is the demand which you saw earlier, yeah. And then purple is the demand which is yet to be covered. That means green minus open is what is being generated using variable resources. Okay, so you can see that from seven o'clock till six o'clock, there is decent generation. This is essentially coming first, yeah, and the one which is before that is essentially coming from it. But what this creates an interesting problem is that, let's say nuclear energy, you cannot really shut off your nuclear generator. Nuclear Generation is going to be produced, so let's say most of, or the lower part of this. Let's say that's the nuclear generation, so 11,000 and that's a constant. So what you need to do is, you know, your gas, natural gas, electricity generation, needs to be high here, and then it needs to switch off, and then it needs to be higher, right, which is a very weird setup, and then at on some days, then it's high cloud curve. They'll need to be active here as well, right?

S Speaker 327:51the weather data, because they assume that the cost of solar energy is zero and wind is negative, negative because, because of the subsidies provided by the government. It actually is a cost benefit to produce it. And natural gas, obviously is costly, so the price would change massively based on what your prediction of this is, right? And this is there for each market, and then each hub and so on. So does it require? Yes, how much is it evaluate? Is a bit debatable. Yeah, you probably have to speak to a trader too.

S Speaker 228:33That makes sense. That makes sense. Do you happen to know someone who's probably on an energy trading desk right now that I can speak to

S Speaker 328:59But like for example, we trade electricity right now as well in my new firm, but that's only on the future. So for us, we would probably not use weather data till like another, next three, four years, because we are trading so many things. Yeah, and whether it's also power is just a very small fraction of what we are doing right Cisco or DC energy is probably a better bet.
But like for example, we trade electricity right now as well in my new firm, but that's only on the future.

S Speaker 330:24even if you're able to provide, let's say, accurate weather forecast to all of these forms, if everyone has that, then there's no value Yeah. So it's a value add only if, let's say one person has it, and he's extract something out of it, which others don't have it yet, but the moment it is available to everyone, essentially, there's no value right there, yeah, which is why all out of these firms prefer raw data sets, because if you have raw data sets, then you can create your own prediction models, and no one else has access to your IP, right? But the business that you're looking at is trying to supply their IP to other forms, which, to an extent, is attractive for a year or two, I don't know how much later on, a lot of the times we just keep data sets active, just because we used to have it. It used to be relevant, and then we want to keep monitoring it. Yeah, and we decide to switch off, which might happen with this as well. But then there might be some other use case of other data. So hard to judge that, but that's usually the belief in at least from a financial side of things, most of the data suppliers try to be on a subscription based model because of that, so they can keep getting money instead of a one time fee, and take this data set right? Then that also means that if there's no

S Speaker 332:13with like, let's say ice or some other players who provide with the data. Yeah, basic testing. A lot of the way the weather data is actually also free. So whatever is provided by the government is free. So

S Speaker 232:30that's to consider. But then ISO and some other people also charge for specific weather data, and these are more accurate, or are these more recent? I Yeah,

S Speaker 332:46They should be decent as well. But I think most of our most of the firms who are trading end up buying from ISO because they are already subscribed to the prices from ISO. So why not just get everything? It's also the point that everyone has such easy access to, then maybe you should also get and monitor it. If it's something like some clipper curves, then you will have much better. Yeah,
