S Speaker 10:03What is it is it my turn our is how you can go
S Speaker 22:16Yeah, thanks for the background. And maybe you can talk about the prior few questions that looked at the product. You know, one of our portfolio companies from way back was clarify and it's still a portfolio company. If you're familiar, they're also based in New York. And and then clarify initially how this product of searching through it was an AI based product before the age of transformers as well. Are you familiar with clarify?

S Speaker 23:00we know about the sponsor. So we'd love to learn more about you know, how you're thinking about how many people on the team Brandon?

S Speaker 13:09Survey right now. We raised our seed round back in October. So we're not actively fundraising at the moment. Likely fundraising probably in March 2025. Again, if anything, but in terms of team size, we like to keep the team relatively small most of our engineering team is fairly flat structure with all of our machinery usage in house welcome product in house like myself. So the more nimble the better our opinion so

S Speaker 13:50Most people are based in New York City survey apparently all in person. You have a few people that are remote right now. immigration issues. So, yeah.

S Speaker 14:04In terms of I guess, like you talked about like clarifying in some of the stuff around I guess in this case, they do AI work. orchestration, that kind of stuff. Well,

S Speaker 14:44Got it. That makes sense. I think. My opinions on on sort of schools that seems to be a little bit more targeted towards, like the supply chain that sets up like API based integrations are trying to integrate and other products is that you run into the issue of because you don't own the platform. You really need the AI layer and it's very easy to replicate them in our case, for example, like we would ever need to use a clarifier because we built the same technology in house. We focus on building a full platform that we sell to the actual application users. So most of our customers are in the production companies, those production facilities and creative agencies, the people that actually have the data, we're not targeting other companies that are trying to you know, use AI with other products. And so the the focus for us, if anything is actually less on the AI front and more on the how can we build a better experience for people to work with their files anywhere? And so the main pieces that we actually solve is a you have 100 terabytes in New York City. If you have two terabytes in LA, you have 300 terabytes in London. How do I make sure that your whole team across all these different locations can have access to all this one petabyte of data as it goes one unified file system from anywhere and then build the intelligence layer on top to be like, Hey, this is the super Spark as it applies. So it's a very different problem and certainly search the more of it interest. And
Got it. That makes sense. I think.

S Speaker 26:04that's what's special like the is what you're working on is that such that you're able to provide exploration of these large bios in a low latency fashion and what like, what's the special sauce that you build? Yeah,
that's what's special like the is what you're working on is that such that you're able to provide exploration of these large bios in a low latency fashion and what like, what's the special sauce that you build? Yeah,

S Speaker 18:15Okay, cool. So this is running in my in my web browser right now believe it does not have just the big Fs component but we have essentially a built in our case. I don't want to Google Drive a look alike, right. But like I said, What are the big things that we offer more than Google Drive? One retargeted Media Two, we built out the AI stack that can search everything from images to video, the multimodal AI stack, and then three and most importantly, how do people interact? With your data and other data in our case is not only in the cloud, our data is going to be in a variety of different locations, whether that's Network Attached Storage, locally, long term storage that they might have, or cloud storage, and we want to make all of that data feel like it is just like a Google Drive is one single pane of glass for all your files. And so that's the vision and that's what we're building towards and how we do that is through workspaces and drives. And then AI search on top where you can actually go through and sorry, I think maybe our servers are down, but be able to search and sift through large amounts of media and data as you can see there. And search through things like Stefan curry, shooting a shot, for example. And finally, the search results as a result. So you have these great they're presented
Okay, cool. So this is running in my in my web browser right now believe it does not have just the big Fs component but we have essentially a built in our case.

S Speaker 29:33so so this video search, no, this is me. This is me.
so so this video search, no, this is me. This is me.
so so this video search, no, this is me. This is me.
so so this video search, no, this is me. This is me.
S Speaker 29:40So how you been? Doing video search is an expensive effort. And Google just launched Google Photos I think they only announced I don't know, I don't think that now launched yet. They announced that I will Google Photo searching through videos for the first time and then primarily because the cost in searches for videos. Yeah.

S Speaker 110:14So the way that we get about that as we generate, we just grab a set of preview images from the videos of the sample specific frames from the videos themselves, and then from there, generate the embeddings from those so it's a little bit more effective. It's obviously going to be skipping certain frames, you might miss a little bit of data, but you know what you sacrifice for? I guess, accuracy, you gain speed and efficiency. And overall, we haven't seen any issues that are like Top 10 Top 20 Recall. Interesting,

S Speaker 210:41okay. This is actually really cool for anybody who's trying to and then this is so how does this work? So this is are you running the models locally or in the cloud?
okay. This is actually really cool for anybody who's trying to and then this is so how does this work? So this is are you running the models locally or in the cloud?
okay. This is actually really cool for anybody who's trying to and then this is so how does this work? So this is are you running the models locally or in the cloud?

S Speaker 213:12So so that was all in and the reception is better, much better than even what we accept expected and which is great. And then so we think that also a lot of these models will run on on the edge and then worked at Microsoft can make a lot of things like they have this recall feature. Which in some ways that tech could be similar but then, you know, solving for different problems, which of course, what did I see on my screen? Let me search. And it's so so so all of that is running on that view. Right. So So yeah, it's exciting to think about the tech a little bit which is one of the pieces of tech that we've built that you've had to build that really enables the product.

S Speaker 114:08Yeah, so we in this case, we don't we don't dive really down into like, you know, the kernel because we don't really interact directly with arm or anything. So we still use pipe cores and torque under the hood of us onyx and that kind of stuff. So that speeds up our process, of course. So our BIPA we're Python back end, we've wrapped react front end electron makes it easy to run. I'm just talking about that. So most of our machine learning we've written mostly a combination of Jackson torch. So nothing super, super crazy there. But again, all of the training that we've done, we've actually done it using Azure and during the distillation there, move those into production. We have a set of systems that can do online learning what's really cool some tech that we built is with our foundation model, you can actually fine tune our search engine to very specific use cases. For example, we're talking to like Sky do and say yo has drone specific data, which is very different from my dad shooting equal photography. So there's an element of like, Hey, how can shade because it enables a filesystem element of being able to work with your files from anywhere. How can we apply this to a variety of different media use cases? That's not just you know, photos, it's not just you know, what you mentioned, you're still seeing Google Photos, but manufacturing industrial, all these other use cases healthcare is really a future that we're excited for. But that's attack. Like in most of our models, like you said 100 megabytes once you quantize it and get it running on the edge. Mostly run I'm not using Onyx at the moment. So we're personally very excited about having better centralized you know r&b stuff and makes development easier and make support. Right, so back to zero. So there's a lot of improvements there from the developer stuff, right. And,
Yeah, so we in this case, we don't we don't dive really down into like, you know, the kernel because we don't really interact directly with arm or anything.

S Speaker 215:41and so you said I mean, you distilled your model and a model from a technology defensibility standpoint, which is, is that a defensible no for you, which is the distillation process of making and then and then the reference model for something what you have is it like ResNet, based, like is that or is it something?
and so you said I mean, you distilled your model and a model from a technology defensibility standpoint, which is, is that a defensible no for you, which is the distillation process of making and then and then the reference model for something what you have is it like ResNet, based, like is that or is it something?

S Speaker 116:17You do? It's more business I started basically familiar with like, some of those. Yeah, I don't want to disclose too much and it doesn't matter. I think from my art from our standpoint, the AI is not a AI is I have a firm belief that AI is marginal utility is really what you want to do with AI and the workflows you have around it. And so the distillation what we have done and this is something that is really big values. I think that large number of companies at the moment still need to catch up when it comes to building smaller faster AI is that save them costs Chachi VT is not a solution. Unfortunately, it's going to cost people way too much, especially in our business to try to index petabytes of data. It literally makes no sense. Right? And so we've had to based on the constraints of our problem, build something that smaller now do we have the best model like probably not, you can go to club labs, you can go to other companies. If you really want to invest in the best model, right? Microsoft, Google, they're always going to publish their research. But what we have done is we've built a platform in which users can interact with AI in a way that is seamless, integrated with their workflow, customer and fine tune the AI to their specific use case, just like how you know GBT events where if you have a vision of like, hey, again, I'm working in the manufacturing use case. So I need to find to my search model for that use case. And we only need like 100 to 500 samples to really fine tune. So those are the types of value adds up to you're excited about where we've built this end to end. application where you can actually own the application mode, and then the ecosystem vote and levers are created talking about that we have which AI being a component of it, but the FS is real time file system being a very significant component of it, enabling us to really capture a very significant portion of how people work. With their files.
You do? It's more business I started basically familiar with like, some of those. Yeah, I don't want to disclose too much and it doesn't matter. I think from my art from our standpoint, the AI is not a AI is I have a firm belief that AI is marginal utility is really what you want to do with AI and the workflows you have around it.

S Speaker 218:00And, and your target market is mostly creators that are creating petabytes of data, right.
And, and your target market is mostly creators that are creating petabytes of data, right.

And, and your target market is mostly creators that are creating petabytes of data, right.
S Speaker 118:10Today. As of now, as of now that's crap. I think it's very important for us to be focused on creatives at the moment but where I see this application going is honestly just go back to machine learning. Right? In the computer vision, right? We talked about media. Well, as we were training this thing, you realize this problem where you have a one terabyte data set that you want to train model with, and I want to hit a pre ash to make sure that you can train a one terabyte yes or even with other institutions. And it's very frustrating. It's super annoying, because it just takes forever. It takes a great deal of time. With our system. We have the SDK, right we unlock the file system. You can mount our shape file system to any of these sequences to any computer and into Kubernetes or a local computer. And the data that you have access to is literally they're in real time it's as if it's a os dauntless directory and what's really excited about that is like I'm super excited to not only see our applications were created and media and all these other more you know, and and people that are developers, but also opening this up to like, can we partner with a hockey base and offer something that's the data set repository where people can actually store the data with Che, and then enable people to that immediately access the data from wherever they are, like these types of applications actually can really kind of open up really, it's just a marketing and distribution kind of opportunity. And so those are some of the things that I have thinking about, it's like okay, we have to start recruiting you have to start somewhere. But from there, start identifying the different use cases as we create the partnerships and build up the use cases. It's
Today. As of now, as of now that's crap.

S Speaker 219:36about this right? Yeah, I mean, I think distribution distribution is going to be very, very critical. I mean, there's got to be so depending on who your target audience is, like, for example, if you want more developers to also start building their honey based partnership. Yes, what that gets you is, I mean, I think, in this market, and so it's going to be a market of lands and AI or a lot of like, AI enabled products are going to be about who can land fast Yeah. For the next three years. And and then this is where distribution is gonna get like you got to have that virality moment. So. So this developers in the virality moment will come with a partnership.
about this right? Yeah, I mean, I think distribution distribution is going to be very, very critical. I mean, there's got to be so depending on who your target audience is, like, for example, if you want more developers to also start building their honey based partnership.

S Speaker 220:35And an events, you know, creative. I'm curious. Okay, so since you're selling creatives, right so I am, yeah, but I think like, you know, hugging faces also in one of my investments are better investment than another company called Val sedans, for example. You might not have heard of them. Or I don't know if you've heard of them, but I'm sure you've heard of 11 Max. Wetlands. Yes, yes. Yes. So, but turns out that Nelson Labs has much better AI voices than 11 Labs is just they they created that virality moment. Really fast. And really cool their videos. I mean, every time you want to watch that two minute video that you create every single time, same goes with runway who also sells to creatives. Level labs figured out they sell creatives, so I feel like that and then video. I mean, more specifically, what I mean by virality is then being able to create those videos that people really that become viral, you know, how you're thinking about, are you and then so your land? Is there is your hands larger enterprises. In terms of parents, are you thinking lands with you know, anybody who's creating a video and like who's got a sizable, you know, material for let's say who's MKBHD who was creating content for YouTube?
And an events, you know, creative. I'm curious.

Okay, that's a I agree. So I think that's what you at NAB.
S Speaker 124:26I was Yeah, I think it was great. We met with a lot of your customers made a lot of good partnerships as well. So I'm assuming that's priceless.
I was Yeah, I think it was great. We met with a lot of your customers made a lot of good partnerships as well. So I'm assuming that's priceless.

S Speaker 224:38was running a business? Okay. Well, that's awesome. Thanks. So that's, that's good. I know. We're probably Hey, I really enjoyed the conversation. I wonder so so in terms of the you said, you're not raising, currently you raised How much did you raise and who did you raise from? Yeah,
was running a business? Okay. Well, that's awesome. Thanks. So that's, that's good. I know. We're probably Hey, I really enjoyed the conversation. I wonder so so in terms of the you said, you're not raising, currently you raised How much did you raise and who did you raise from? Yeah,

S Speaker 125:05so we raised 4.4 18. It was opposed. From general catalyst, signifier of blank GC about the round signal fireplace, but the rest and then we had a few angels. So that was the problem, especially in this I think, apparently in this in this market of things, but things are good. And then your associations. Yes, our expectations for a potential in the race. We're expecting 2 million ARR by December is their expectation. And then if that goes to plan, like we would like to raise sometime in March 2025, which I think he boasted about.

S Speaker 225:46That'd be great. And then if and when I met Are you planning to come to the Bay Area?
That'd be great. And then if and when I met Are you planning to come to the Bay Area?
That'd be great. And then if and when I met Are you planning to come to the Bay Area?
That'd be great. And then if and when I met Are you planning to come to the Bay Area?
S Speaker 125:55Likely I'll probably make a trip out to LA again, because a lot of our international clients are there to get some interest there but definitely you can. I think I have to go to SF anyways or at least in the area to also visit Apple Microsoft so happy to connect with
Likely I'll probably make a trip out to LA again, because a lot of our international clients are there to get some interest there but definitely you can. I think I have to go to SF anyways or at least in the area to also visit Apple Microsoft so happy to connect with

you if you would love to host you or we can back me interview or whatever. And and then I'm here then bluebird in New
S Speaker 127:49Yeah, no, that would be great. I can see a few things. One, obviously, we can just if you want to send the I think I have access to like the neural processing SDK and the Android SDK that I'm looking at right now on the website. We'll take a look at those.
Yeah, no, that would be great. I can see a few things. One, obviously, we can just if you want to send the I think I have access to like the neural processing SDK and the Android SDK that I'm looking at right now on the website. We'll take a look at those.

S Speaker 228:04But we have to you really I think want to have to So there's an AI Moto, Qualcomm AI model hub, and then over here, it's super easy to check and then have it listed. I
But we have to you really I think want to have to So there's an AI Moto, Qualcomm AI model hub, and then over here, it's super easy to check and then have it listed. I
But we have to you really I think want to have to So there's an AI Moto, Qualcomm AI model hub, and then over here, it's super easy to check and then have it listed. I
But we have to you really I think want to have to So there's an AI Moto, Qualcomm AI model hub, and then over here, it's super easy to check and then have it listed. I
28:18think we've enabled here we've enabled the platform as well. So in order for you to try out a device, it's super easy. It's like a few clicks of a button.
think we've enabled here we've enabled the platform as well. So in order for you to try out a device, it's super easy. It's like a few clicks of a button.
think we've enabled here we've enabled the platform as well. So in order for you to try out a device, it's super easy. It's like a few clicks of a button.
think we've enabled here we've enabled the platform as well. So in order for you to try out a device, it's super easy. It's like a few clicks of a button.
S Speaker 228:38Just send it where you find it. Yeah. Cool. So it's super easy to find it. And so to say that would be the easiest way to see if you know this platform could work for you to run your models. Got it makes sense. Yeah. Oh,
Just send it where you find it. Yeah. Cool. So it's super easy to find it. And so to say that would be the easiest way to see if you know this platform could work for you to run your models. Got it makes sense. Yeah. Oh,
Just send it where you find it. Yeah. Cool. So it's super easy to find it. And so to say that would be the easiest way to see if you know this platform could work for you to run your models. Got it makes sense. Yeah. Oh,

S Speaker 129:06awesome. Yeah, no, I think we're always interested in adding at least more AI models into our pipelines as well. So it seems like it'd be something that we could make while we got Qualcomm specific pipeline, which would be really interesting and then you know, make a go to market motion or something that says like, Hey, if you put this could be run, we recommend people not to necessarily running just directly on an asset on a computer itself. So it could be a Qualcomm based computer or we might have interests aspirations of actually building our own hardware. And so in that way, whoever's the Qualcomm II as part of that or something, so yeah,
awesome. Yeah, no, I think we're always interested in adding at least more AI models into our pipelines as well.
