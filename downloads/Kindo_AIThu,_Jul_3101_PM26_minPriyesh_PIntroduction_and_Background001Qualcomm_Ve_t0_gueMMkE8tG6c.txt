S Speaker 10:43currently in the Bay Area. Ron, so most of our team members, half of us are in the bay and half of us are in San Diego with Qualcomm and cortices, yeah, and Ron, so pleasure meeting. Would love to know a little bit more about Kindle from your words. It's a new space for us. And then maybe before we start, I would love to give you an overview about myself, a little bit about the fund, how we operate, and then we can take it over them there. Yeah, sounds good. So Ron with, I'm a Senior Associate here in the team. I've been with the Fund for about a year and a half now, particularly focusing on AI, applied AI, I would say. But at the same times, a lot of times at infrastructure, foundation model companies as well. And then prior to that, I've spent some time at Menlo Ventures and with Morpheus ventures in LA while I was doing my MBA there at UCLA. So started my career as across different early stage ventures. Saw fund of company going from series A to unicorn. So that was a great experience. And being with being in venture for about three years now, broadly that the fund itself has been around for 25 years. So we are the corporate venture arm of Qualcomm, and we invest out of the balance sheet. Typically aim to deploy about $150 million a year in the US geography. But then we have offices across the globe, six different regional offices in Brazil, Israel, China and Europe, to name a few places. And then check sizes would be anywhere from two to $15 million typically a Series A plus investor. But we have also done some scene recently in AI and then big focus area for the fund in the recent days has been AI, both infrastructure, tooling, foundation model and applied vertical AI as well. And apart from that, IoT, industrial automation, a lot of mobile technologies, communications areas where we have invested in the past.

S Speaker 12:43seems like a very, very interesting space for us. We have a partner dedicated specifically on dev set ops. So as a next follow up, Paul, I would like to loop him for our conversations as well, and then anything, anything in particular that I can answer,

S Speaker 22:58yeah, maybe just so what's the goal of Qualcomm ventures? Is it strategic investments into things for Qualcomm, or is it like an open fund? Or how do you guys work? So

S Speaker 13:10it's a it's a hybrid of hybrid of those two approaches. As I would like to put it, what we try to do, particularly with our investments, is make sure that we have any try to evaluate if we have any business unit partnerships that we can get into for a lot of our portfolio companies brought in Qualcomm as a customer. So that's that's also something that we can expand. And then we are as a company, as a corporate run, we are expanding our chip sets, which initially was very expansively into mobiles to different platforms, across wearables. Now we have started a PC business wherein home PCs have and Qualcomm chipset inbuilt has an NPU which can run AI workloads on device itself. We also now have a data center play, which is nascent in its terms, but down the line, would expand quite into a big business unit for us as well. So we feel a lot of companies we invest in, we can either through GTM partnerships, Cloud Credits, things like that, from some of these platforms as well. Yeah, totally

S Speaker 216:41And then, you know, I think Andy and I doing most of the selling. We were probably going to end the year at three and a half or four, but on June 1, Matthew vargasy jumped in from silver Ford. And Matthew is this amazing security sales leader. He was early at duo, early at Tania, took them into, you know, their high growth phase. He was early at Bromium took them into their acquisition. He was early at ArcSight took them into their acquisition back in the day. And so knows how to take an a round startup into 10s of millions of dollars in revenue. Silver for I think he jumped us about 2 million in annual revenue last year. They closed the year. This year they're gonna close at 100 plus. And so, like, he's, you know, just amazing. Took me six months to recruit him at but we've got him in now, and he's just kind of, kind of poured gasoline on everything we're doing. And so back in May, we're having a board meeting, and I went to the board I'm like, hey, look, we're getting ready to hire this great sales guy. Why don't we put some more money on the cap table, on the balance sheet? Because I need, he's going to need to go hire five or six people, probably to take momentum away from anything else we're doing. I don't want to trim back whiteroad Neo training, or take some engineers or whatever. Or whatever. And then, so let's let him scale that up. And then let's go do a B round in the winter. And then I want enough money on the balance sheet so that, you know, we look healthy at B round time too. And it's and so, you know, we talked through and it's like, yeah, let's do that. So we got an inside round we're putting together, but I want to get the one, one or two more outside players in me before we go into the B round. Right now, drive is around the table. You know, they're multi stage fund. Got a billion dollars or whatever. They own 26% of the company. And they're great. They've been really, really good. But I don't want to own 35% of like an outfit and so, and I'm sure, you know, they'd be comfortable if we got somebody yet. But the so I started out like, Hey, let's go talk to a few people and see if we can get, you know, a really good strategic around the table, or, you know, another mid size, or larger fund that that wants to charge with us before we get to the B round. And we're raising 10,000,075 posts. So trying to keep it easy to get into almost like an a round for us, a smaller one, you know, because our our preempted a round was very much more like a big seed round. And then we'll go get the b done in the winter, as you just get a little more revenue. And then we'll go do

S Speaker 119:19that. Thanks. Thanks, Ron. This was, this was an amazing overview. And thanks a lot for taking me through the journey. Stella and mercy. You have put together a very amazing team in there. So you're, you're using a 10 million round, and how much of that is taken by the insiders right now? How much is, yeah,
that. Thanks. Thanks, Ron. This was, this was an amazing overview. And thanks a lot for taking me through the journey. Stella and mercy. You have put together a very amazing team in there.

S Speaker 219:40I think we're, we're bouncing around. The C funds are pretty much tapped out, like they'll put in, you know, got like, maybe 500k each or something to put in, and then it's kind of up to drive in. Our Re is an a round fund, but we lost our partner. He left the firm back in January, and I'm talking to the, you know, just, kind of just stepping in, but he's getting up to speed. I'm not sure what they're going to do and drive. On the other hand, you know, their pro rata would probably be four or 5 million or something, and then the rest is kind of there. And if I needed to, I could probably get drive to take a little less to make sure a new fund, like, if you guys needed a position, a minimum position at 10% could probably like that out the, you know, got a few other unnatural things I could, I could do to make that happen. But, but anyway, so check size anywhere from 1,000,002 million, or, you know, if someone wanted to put up to seven, I might be able

I'm not sure what they're going to do and drive. On the other hand, you know, their pro rata would probably be four or 5 million or something, and then the rest is kind of there. And if I needed to, I could probably get drive to take a little less to make sure a new fund, like, if you guys needed a position, a minimum position at 10% could probably like that out the, you know, got a few other unnatural things I could, I could do to make that happen. But, but anyway, so check size anywhere from 1,000,002 million, or, you know, if someone wanted to put up to seven, I might be able

S Speaker 120:44to make that happen right. Understand from so that that fits, I think certainly we can get to that discussion when the time comes. But broadly, that fits in the space that we would like to play in. The valuation is also good, good for an editor, for sure, would love to understand a little bit more about the use cases. Ron i the initial deck memo that I have, I see some pretty interesting enterprise customers that you have, would love to understand what are the use cases that some of these guys are using, and how has some of these expansions shaped up?

S Speaker 224:10you know, any kind of issue that pops up that you need to apply a fix. And that's why the devsecops thing starts to get important, because in a modern infrastructure, the response side, I might need to go in and actually start changing infrastructure quickly. And before that would be a multi step slow process across our organization. And now organizations can really start that and respond much faster. And so so we think those core thing

I would love to do a little bit more digging myself, and then come back to you with some questions and another call, including one more member of my team, parallely. Ron, would appreciate if you could send me the deck. I have a memo. If this is the thing, then that's fine as well. But let me know if you have more read up materials for me.
