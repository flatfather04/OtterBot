S Speaker 20:41it's all also we'd like to back the founders of of our prior portfolios. So,

0:52well, this is very different. There's
well, this is very different. There's
well, this is very different. There's
well, this is very different. There's
S Speaker 20:54no hardware returns back, yeah, and
no hardware returns back, yeah, and
no hardware returns back, yeah, and
no hardware returns back, yeah, and
S Speaker 10:58there's no hardware this time. So at the very least, you know, if you know, if you were willing to invest in hardware makes it, you know, easier. I was just selling Priyesh. We were, our goal at Demo Day, which was literally last Tuesday, was to raise another couple million. I raised four from Andreessen and crosslink. I've known both firms for 15 years. Yeah, so there's no drama. And we went through a full partners meeting on Monday, crossing came back and said, like, Listen, you guys have made a huge amount of progress. We'd like the positioning, everything about the story, like, you know, the correction, like, all of us, stuff is fitted. What we'd like to do is lead a $5 million round, and that gives you into 2027, to grow into $100 million valuation. So then you can do a 20 on 100 posts. And if the market collapses, you know, we still want there to be enough room on a $50 million and you get to, you know, three to 5 million of PRR, you can still do a $50 million round. This will give you that option as well, but the valuation would be somewhere in the 35 to $40 million range. So that's likely what we're going to end up doing. And then I'm just trying to figure out ground construction, not so much allocations for each group, but just ground construction. If someone's going to take three and a half of the five, then that only leaves a million, and I have three or $4 million of demand on the original $2 million in saves. Yeah, so I'm that. That's my goal this week. But that's where the round itself sits. Without putting pressure on anyone to react, that's on Thursday. This is where we're
there's no hardware this time. So at the very least, you know, if you know, if you were willing to invest in hardware makes it, you know, easier. I was just selling Priyesh.

4:10and then since then,
S Speaker 24:13the you know, our investment mandate, as you can imagine, it's just as things move to AI. And as we started going into more things beyond automotive, IoT, cloud and all infrastructure and all of that, we started investing more and more. Initially, it was a lot of it. It was an AI infrastructure. We invested in companies like hugging face and tweets and biases and knocked ml. Scale, yeah, scale and Oh, Gareth. Okay, good. Got it. So, yeah, Gareth is also. Gareth actually left around then as well.

S Speaker 25:30per year in AI, so and then so for this year done, we've done one we're going to do one more soon, and and then we're looking to do and then, so our typical check size for a seed, it is a minimum of 1.5 we don't want to be the 500k check, because the problem is, it won't make sense for us, but then until we want to be a minimum. So that's where
per year in AI, so and then so for this year done, we've done one we're going to do one more soon, and and then we're looking to do and then, so our typical check size for a seed, it is a minimum of 1.5 we don't want to be the 500k check, because the problem is, it won't make sense for us, but then until we want to be a minimum.

6:04our current seed strategy is,
our current seed strategy is,
our current seed strategy is,
our current seed strategy is,
S Speaker 26:09and and so we're looking to invest in, and then most of this would be investing in applications, the application layer for AI, so this is perfect. Yeah, that you had. It was very interesting. You know, the funny thing is, there's this friend of mine at factorial fund. He Ping me this morning. He's like, Hey, can you introduce me to someone? And he sent me a message saying someone who's connected, who's connected to you, and I didn't know. And I was like, okay, dude, I have, I don't know that connection and and then I didn't, I realized what was, then they're also on the roster. Have you meeting with you
and and so we're looking to invest in, and then most of this would be investing in applications, the application layer for AI, so this is perfect. Yeah, that you had. It was very interesting.

S Speaker 17:15yeah, I think that's Andrew's angle within the fund complexes. He wants to compete with what he wants to own seed and become that vehicle within the Andreessen Horowitz family of funds. Yeah. And I didn't realize how siloed they were, because I talked to Justine and the consumer fund and Anish over there, and they were like, well, we want to invest too. And I'm just like, but you're already investors. And they're like, no, no, you know, this is the first we're seeing it. I'm like, What do you mean? You guys did the whole event. It really is this.

You know, now the marketing manager that has, you know, an idea in her head, she can pitch her boss on that quickly before she would have to sketch it out, or she would send it to the corporate creative team, and then they, you guys are Qualcomm, so you have into creative teams. But it cuts down on the back and forth, because everyone's looking at the same thing, which is the same benefit of a Google slide, which is the same benefit of the figma, same benefit for Canva.

S Speaker 216:56Yes, that's right. And then, and the the difference from so see, we've looked at 3d Canva for 3d with other companies in the past as well, yeah, and there were Canva for three companies that we're also building for a lot of the XR platforms, and then, yes, to, you know, A web interface as well. So what's the difference between some of those and what you're building now?

Yes, that's right. And then, and the the difference from so see, we've looked at 3d Canva for 3d with other companies in the past as well, yeah, and there were Canva for three companies that we're also building for a lot of the XR platforms, and then, yes, to, you know, A web interface as well. So what's the difference between some of those and what you're building now?
S Speaker 222:04And is that so you don't have, like, a diffusion model, which we did not.
And is that so you don't have, like, a diffusion model, which we did not.
And is that so you don't have, like, a diffusion model, which we did not.
And is that so you don't have, like, a diffusion model, which we did not.
S Speaker 122:09So that's two things we did not build. We did not build a foundational model and try and replicate things that we do, we have many vendors for, and we did not replicate anything that is an image generation or asset generation model, because we believe those would get commoditized. A year ago, there were not many of them, because Luma hadn't come out, Edward hadn't come like none of these things. Now there's 50 providers. And the reason we didn't do that because as industry people, we know large companies have their own relationships. So if I'm selling to EA and they've got to deal with open AI, they need to be able to plug open AI into this architecture. Yeah, we can't be charging them twice because we have incorporated, you know, we've built our own stack, and now that's all or nothing for them. So we be focused again. This is part of this phase we focus on, and it doesn't compete with their workflows, right? Like we're not asking them to replace their existing workflows, of their existing tools.

S Speaker 124:11You know, one of the bad news about browser based tools is it's very, very hard to move windows. But let me show you what that same thing renders into so I can take key frames, all of those shots that you just saw, and that will turn into this, all right? And this, you know, would normally take probably two and a half three days in a Gen AI engine, maybe a couple of days. They would take about a week in a normal workflow, and this takes about three hours or four hours in our system, three hours, probably right. And it's not perfect, because you can see she changes a little bit from C to C, but that's the worst the images are ever going to get it. But that part you saw the running thing in this is the same city that we're looking at, and so you can do all of this stuff today, with today's technology, just feeding in game frames, one of those companies open up APIs, remember that everything repeating them is a full three scene graph with an F map and everything else, you're going to be able to get camera angles, blurs, resolutions, because everything is both in 3d It's not taking 2d pixels in a neural net and trying to simulate that this pixel ought to be blurred, but that pixel ought to not be. It is literally replicating the physics of what you would do in the real world inside of a browser. And then when you want to hide fidelity, once you've got the white idea, you're then able to print it with just a push profile and get your storyboards and your visuals. And that makes the pitching faster. Pitching process a lot faster, easier achievement.

S Speaker 225:42So the physics, so I see the physics of this, which is the physics is deterministic, and so it works better than the diffusion models. That's correct. The generation of you know, like it's still unrealistic. It's not photo real. That's

S Speaker 125:57correct. And that's that for us, it works really well because a but we feel like the production tools, like all these guys over here, they're going to get there, there's too much compute, too much money, too much time being spent by too many people that, you know, it'll just become a commodity service with, like, a price point attached to it. It'll definitely be cheaper than doing physical things, and it will definitely have many, many providers at this point in time, not just one. So we'll be able to pick from providers. But here's the more important point, like, you don't need extreme fidelity when you're doing the early part of the process, if you're an agency responding to an RFP, you're trying to get something out quickly, and you're trying to get it to 70, 80% fidelity, because you're just, you don't even know if you're in the white ballpark. You're just trying to get someone to engage with you, to get to that bank. That's the core of the tool. The core of the tool is not getting to final production. And so you've got to pick the business that you're in and the use case you're in. You know, otherwise it doesn't make sense. And we really focus on high stakes professional, someone sending it to our boss, someone sending an agency pitching a clients, you know, a screenwriter pitching Netflix like these are all high stakes things where at the end of it, there's a big role, a big prize, either reputational or dollars. And getting to that yes is a really important thing for that person. Okay,
correct.

yeah. And then typically, are these agencies open to
27:21adopting new tools
S Speaker 127:23they hate. I will say no. I mean, so we tested this, but the like about some of the top you know, agencies, agencies, games and VFX studios in the world, they love the product. So far,
they hate. I will say no. I mean, so we tested this, but the like about some of the top you know, agencies, agencies, games and VFX studios in the world, they love the product. So far,

S Speaker 228:47interesting, so and then. So right now, mostly these guys are, I mean, I saw maybe you go through it, which is you charging like 15 bucks per month per user, is that? And then they can swipe a credit card.
interesting, so and then. So right now, mostly these guys are, I mean, I saw maybe you go through it, which is you charging like 15 bucks per month per user, is that? And then they can swipe a credit card.

S Speaker 132:35in June. So going back to this, I think, you know, we would be in general availability. We would have paid at this point in time. But we have to build the sub sort features, otherwise nine people are not going to survive. The sign ups and the requests like, it will take us forever, and we'll get left in the market. So we need to build, we need to have software take on a lot of that stuff.
in June. So going back to this, I think, you know, we would be in general availability. We would have paid at this point in time.

S Speaker 232:54Got it okay, and and then, so you should like 2 million work. Arr, which is

Got it okay, and and then, so you should like 2 million work. Arr, which is
S Speaker 133:06great. So that's, that's roughly the pipeline. We have 2000 sign ups. What we see is roughly a one is to poor tax ratio. So even if only half of those convert, and, you know, 40 bucks a month, we should be around 2 million at the ARR, again, I think all these things are iffy. I think the two things we realized is, everyone's experimenting with everything in the AI space, so until you really are in the market and using it for a long time again, we have the Unity data. So it's not like we were imagining that there's a market, but if people are looking for longitudinal data, that's something that's going to have to develop over time. Good news is, because we're focused on pitching, there's a lot more at bats. Yeah, okay,
great. So that's, that's roughly the pipeline. We have 2000 sign ups. What we see is roughly a one is to poor tax ratio. So even if only half of those convert, and, you know, 40 bucks a month, we should be around 2 million at the ARR, again, I think all these things are iffy.

S Speaker 233:48are you going to continue? How do you see, I have seen, like, what can you go to that slide, how you're charging the users?
are you going to continue? How do you see, I have seen, like, what can you go to that slide, how you're charging the users?
are you going to continue? How do you see, I have seen, like, what can you go to that slide, how you're charging the users?
are you going to continue? How do you see, I have seen, like, what can you go to that slide, how you're charging the users?
S Speaker 133:56Yeah, yeah. I don't believe in startups innovating on pricing, honestly, because the market sets the price. Yeah, the way I think about it is just doesn't make business sense. So if you're a small agency, this four or five, if you're going to spend $200 a month on this tool, the average SMB contract is about 20 grand. If you're doing a small, very small kind of video project, maybe they make six grand in margin on that 20 grand. So you're spending 200 grand, and sorry, $200 and if all you do is close one more deal a month using this tool, it's more than paid for itself. So again, we come from industry, so our lenses like would be buy this, and I would be explaining for ourselves as owners of an agency, because there's so many tools around. But can't I just do this in chat. GPT, is always going to come up. Yeah, right. And so if we're in the production business, you should absolutely just do it in chat. GPT, oh, the show drops. I think you just hated my answer. This
Yeah, yeah. I don't believe in startups innovating on pricing, honestly, because the market sets the price. Yeah, the way I think about it is just doesn't make business sense. So if you're a small agency, this four or five, if you're going to spend $200 a month on this tool, the average SMB contract is about 20 grand. If you're doing a small, very small kind of video project, maybe they make six grand in margin on that 20 grand. So you're spending 200 grand, and sorry, $200 and if all you do is close one more deal a month using this tool, it's more than paid for itself. So again, we come from industry, so our lenses like would be buy this, and I would be explaining for ourselves as owners of an agency, because there's so many tools around. But can't I just do this in chat. GPT, is always going to come up. Yeah, right. And so if we're in the production business, you should absolutely just do it in chat. GPT, oh, the show drops. I think you just hated my answer. This
Yeah, yeah. I don't believe in startups innovating on pricing, honestly, because the market sets the price. Yeah, the way I think about it is just doesn't make business sense.

S Speaker 239:32and that's so. So this future agent stuff that you're talking about like, that's also, if they have to do that today? Do they do that type of stuff today?
and that's so. So this future agent stuff that you're talking about like, that's also, if they have to do that today? Do they do that type of stuff today?

S Speaker 139:43No, no, the closest is what you've seen with the model control protocols, you know, using a prompt, and then it will make unity do that. Yeah, right. So I think that's a real thing. I think that will become easier and easier and easier, but there are logical limits to it. At some point you're still asking people to download two different things. First, an IDE, a development environment and a game engine. You don't have any assets, so now you got to hook in like an asset generation thing. So because in our system, you start with 6000 assets, and then you can make your own or import your own, but you never have the cold start problem, right? And that's what I'm saying. Can someone technically replicate this? Absolutely? Is it going to be easy? Can you imagine PowerPoint getting to Google slides easily from where it is right now? No, because you'd have to cut 90% of the features, and that's just not that user base. So this is specifically a bet on like that top 10% of the feature, so the multimodal input, pitching and ideation, high stakes professional over low stakes casual. But as long as the main thing I think you need to believe with this particular bet is if businesses have to have a conversation about what the creative has to be, this is this? This business should exist in social. Yeah, if individuals are creating content that you don't need to talk to anyone else, and you can use other tools, there's no collaborative, no communication aspect, and there's no business stakes to be. Qual, so our view is, as long as few human beings are around around content, they're going to want to have conversations. Because conversation because Coca Cola cares about its brand and WPP cares make money out of Coca Cola. So production might get more efficient over here, and these guys might get a few more tools to do stuff, but there's, you know, they're still going to have that conversation for every and it's going to get repeated over businesses hundreds of 1000s of times a day. Thanks.

41:584 million last year, okay?

4 million last year, okay?
S Speaker 142:02And then our goal was to raise one to two that form booster is sitting before, okay, so we have runway into q1 of next year, even if we raised no money. Yeah, our thinking was, Let's raise a million to $2 million because, you know, tariffs, crazy shit happens. And then, you know, yeah, optimizing for dilution is never the path to success in venture and founding companies, a couple of million dollars will get us into September of next year. We increase the team size, and then cross link has just been eager to own more of the company. They've seen the company grow. They have longitudinal data on the team. They're like, Look, you have enough of the proof points, and as long as there's enough bedroom to do a great a, or if you have down market, still get to an A that feels like the right answer for the business. But if you have runway until April at 27 which is what 5 million would give this company, you have a long time, even if the market collapses, to at least build into the valuation. Because you can't always predict these things, like we might hit it out of the park, and then everyone might hate AI, but businesses are slow to adopt stuff. It's like, but I think that's the actual rate limiter. It's not technology. It's just, what part of the market do you serve? And do you have to how many people be able to retrain? And we like opening in open spaces. This isn't a bet on there's going to be a new class of agencies using AI to produce production pocket. This is a bet on existing people doing existing jobs using existing tools that are low resolution. And this would just be 100x better for them, but it would not be 100x better for the unity programmer. It would not be a better, 100x better for someone who knows how to use Maya. Yeah, I

And then we might come back to see if cross link has done some analysis, some further analysis in this space. Then we'd love to actually talk to them as well, if you don't mind. Yeah,
