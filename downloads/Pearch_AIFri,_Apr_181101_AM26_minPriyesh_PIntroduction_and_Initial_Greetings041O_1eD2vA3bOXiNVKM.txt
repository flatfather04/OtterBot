S Speaker 23:01that's right, but it's hard to because there's this AI hype, everyone with AI nowadays, right? You know, it's kind of pretty much, I guess it's hard for you guys to differentiate the real companies that build something in COVID scrappers,

S Speaker 13:14agreed, agreed. The market is so crowded and the tech stack, it's not very difficult to differentiate for most of the applications which is generating revenue today. So it's slightly different in terms of AI. We have made good investments in, I would say, foundation model and infrastructure LED. So our investments are in anthropic, hugging, face, scale, AI, weights and biases. And now we started looking more actively in terms of applications. So made a couple of investments earlier this year in applications, and one before that suit more over the year. Got

S Speaker 14:58What parameters, sorry to break your flow. But what parameters do you use to judge your solution versus the other ones? So basically, we built, do play chess, yes, sometimes, but I'm not great at it chess, yeah, in

S Speaker 25:13chess, there is this yellow rating, right? Yeah, right. So the way that rating works is side by side comparisons, right? You compare it to fighters every time, and we build something like ELA rating for search engines. And the way it works is that we hire independent recruiters who will see the description of what kind of person they needed to find, and then just two LinkedIn profiles, right? They only took the profile. They don't know which search engine found each of the LinkedIn profile, and they just vote this profile is better for this one. And they vote like that many times. And we measure the yellow ratings of search engines based on the way recruiters vote. And that way we see that, well, that's one of the way we've done it and we win. We've done is comparing search results using large language models. And again, we see that we're winning. So we see that we win both when people compare results without knowing that which results are good, and using large language models too, right? That's very interesting. And, you know, the great thing about this is that we've built this very with a very small team of four, four researchers. There are companies that have raised and spent, like, 40 times more money than we on this. There are companies that spend 20 plus million dollars to build the technology, and they are not anywhere near what we built. So this is a very Yeah, and for me personally, I would say that this is the total search we have, is four out of 10. It's four out of 10. There's a lot of a lot to do. You know, the vision that we have for this is crazy big. It's, it's, we're just but like the most people use LinkedIn, which is one out of 10 on that scale, you know, and we're four out of 10. So that's, that's what happens right now. So the market is going to be disrupted. There are many companies that are starting to build something like this. But technologically, they all use this, you know, Rachel, like rag and vector embeddings and all that stuff, yeah, and we tried that as well, you know, we tried all of those technologies as well. They just don't work well for this kind of this is a very complex thing. You know, when you search for information, it's a lot easier than finding the person that will be like, Oh, this is the kind of person I need dinner. The people are complex beings, yeah, a lot harder than just some regular information, like, you know, height of Eiffel Tower or whatever. And the regular technologies that exist on market just don't work. So we had to invent a new type of that you'll get some results recently,

S Speaker 18:08very interesting, very interesting. Rajak, I tried the product myself. I was trying to source a few founders in the areas that I'm excited about, and the search engine did give me some really good results. So I was impressed for sure, by just going through the product and just playing with it for some time. How are you thinking about creating a product out of it? And what will be the use cases yourself initially? Yeah,
very interesting, very interesting. Rajak, I tried the product myself.

And what will be the use cases yourself initially? Yeah,
S Speaker 28:34so we're going to focus on two use cases. One is one is like recruiters from fast growing companies will use this as to source candidates, right? That's one use case, and we have a couple of customers that use it that way already. But then there is another use case, which is where we are focus is going to be in the next few months is API and AI agents. We just signed the contract with us that's going to pay us $500,000 a year for the API. And we've just built, and yesterday they started using it. So it's all happening just right now, you know. So we've built, just built API. So API is is crazy, because if you have sourcing tool in the market, then you can provide to all of the companies that are not focused on sourcing only, but that are building all in one HR solutions. You know, there are ATS systems. You know, different companies like different kinds of a, you know, HR, and they all need sourcing. And sourcing is the hardest part, because building like an applicant tracking system, yeah, it's a bunch of features, right? It's still hard to build good products and so on. But technologically, it's pretty clear what exactly to do sourcing is, like, no one knows how to make it work, right? And so the way we're going to sell this to all those all in one HR solutions that need sourcing, like, Hey guys, just, you know, it's very easy to connect this thing and you like, next day, you have a lot better sourcing than all of the market has right now. Yeah, it's that simple and large customer for the API will give us, you know, millions of dollars a year, which makes it, you know, makes it pretty easy to get to break in and profitability. That's the plan for the coming months.

S Speaker 211:00it like it's that pipeline, right? So first you need to like, you have person, and we have access to hundreds of millions of people. First you need across

more sources. Like, is it just LinkedIn, or do you track other sources?
S Speaker 214:30Right now, it's always sourcing people and data on people. So using our API, not only you'll get some data on people, but also you'll get analytics on the person. Like it gives you very, very sharp details about why this person might be relevant or not to exactly what you need. It makes the the you know, the analysis of the candidate, like, like, times easier than ever before. And then we provide, one of the things we see there is interest for is providing additional data like emails or phone numbers for people, and that's doable as well. We're just starting that path, but it's easy to do. It's something that has been done on the market before, many times. So we see, how can we make it easier? So But basically, the final result is ranked candidates for your search query. Very

S Speaker 115:30so where is the company at today? Racha, you mentioned the 500k customer you've just signed. In terms of traction, where are you and have you raised around already?
so where is the company at today? Racha, you mentioned the 500k customer you've just signed. In terms of traction, where are you and have you raised around already?

so where is the company at today? Racha, you mentioned the 500k customer you've just signed. In terms of traction, where are you and have you raised around already?
S Speaker 215:40Well, this is not my first company, and my idea was that I'm not going to be raised money before we see that we've built something meaningful. Basically, this is the moment when I feel like, yeah, we have something. And so I wanted to bootstrap the whole thing. But during the road, you know, I built a few successful companies before I went through Y Combinator with my previous company and so on. So it's a bit easier when you're not a first time founder. People would just reach out and say, Hey, do you want to raise some money? We're like, no. Then at some moment, I said, Okay, you know, screw it. Like, if everyone's bringing money, you gotta take something. Yeah. So we raised $800,000 that way with, like, some incoming interest, and that's, that's very much it. The thing we want to do right is we want to raise a $3 million seat, and we haven't started the process, but that's where we are. We need to start the 3 million around seeds, but we're still focused on, you know, launching the product, because now we're switching from this R and D mindset, yeah, to going public, right? We need a nice website, or the onboarding flows from our customers, some social media stuff and that kind of thing. We're gonna spend some time with that and then probably focus on fundraising. But you know, if we say, you and I have good conversations, and you come and say, Guys, we're like, we're ready to do this, we'll be very much open to discuss,
Well, this is not my first company, and my idea was that I'm not going to be raised money before we see that we've built something meaningful.

Like, if everyone's bringing money, you gotta take something. Yeah. So we raised $800,000 that way with, like, some incoming interest, and that's, that's very much it. The thing we want to do right is we want to raise a $3 million seat, and we haven't started the process, but that's where we are. We need to start the 3 million around seeds, but we're still focused on, you know, launching the product, because now we're switching from this R and D mindset, yeah, to going public, right? We need a nice website, or the onboarding flows from our customers, some social media stuff and that kind of thing. We're gonna spend some time with that and then probably focus on fundraising. But you know, if we say, you and I have good conversations, and you come and say, Guys, we're like, we're ready to do this, we'll be very much open to discuss,
Well, this is not my first company, and my idea was that I'm not going to be raised money before we see that we've built something meaningful. Basically, this is the moment when I feel like, yeah, we have something. And so I wanted to bootstrap the whole thing.

S Speaker 117:12sounds great. Sounds great. Tell me a little bit more about the vision you had. You mentioned initially you were thinking about breaking this into something really big. You're currently at four or 10. Let's, let's go by your nomenclature. What takes you to closer to eight or nine out of 10? And what's the final end game that you're thinking?
sounds great. Sounds great. Tell me a little bit more about the vision you had. You mentioned initially you were thinking about breaking this into something really big. You're currently at four or 10. Let's, let's go by your nomenclature. What takes you to closer to eight or nine out of 10? And what's the final end game that you're thinking?

S Speaker 217:32Yeah, yeah. Great question. So look, it's interesting. We're thinking about search engines at the market of search, like 40 years back, when you needed some some information, there were no searches, and you had the engines, and you had to go to library and ask friends, and that's how you kind of found information, right? And then the search engine error started, and turned out that this is changing everything right, like we use Google and now perplexity and chat GPT, and this is changing like the way we lead, like no, but people search, which is a huge thing, if you think of people search, we're right now. We're only focused on recruitment, but the next industry we're starting is lead generation. Companies need to sell, and they need their they know their ideal customer profiles, but they don't know how to find exactly the people in this in the right companies to sell to. And there is a lot of money on that market, but there is no good tools, right and and then you think of broader use cases of people search like you need mentors and advisors. And then you go to beta c market, dating, all that stuff, yeah, all of this was not developing during the last 30 years, just because people search is so much harder than finding information, that there was no technology that could do that right. And now is the moment when we finally got to the point where this kind of technologies is possible to build, right? And 10 out of 10 is a perfect search engine that can be used by by for B to B and B to C. All of the cases, you'll say, hey, Alexa, find me someone who can jog in the morning with me in my neighborhood, right? And Alexa will reach out to our API and find exactly the people need. Giving us some context, right? So we're talking a general purpose people search engine that can provide all of the, you know, huge ranges of people search. And we see this as an enormous market. And one more thing that happens in the world right now is that we're building AI technology for all of the industries, and we replace so many human beings with technology, right? It's becoming easier to replace this and that and that, yeah, but then there's so many cases where you cannot use technology to replace the people, and every time when you need a human being, because there is no technology, it means that your requirements for that are extremely complex. Yes, right. There is no simple AI technology that can replace your needs for the human and that means that the human search in that cases should be really, really smart, because it's not a delivery guy, yeah, any search engine can find the delivery guy, right? Like simple expectations from delivery guy, and we feel that people search is going to become, you know, harder and harder, and you need more sophisticated AI technologies to solve every case, when someone needs a human, it means that it's really hard to find that human. And we're going to have access to all of the people, all the publicly available like Google has access to all of the publicly available information on any kind of data. We're going to gather all publicly available data on people, all the legally publicly available data on all of the people out there. So we'll provide this, you know, engine that can solve all those cases, using Alexa or for ATS systems or directly on our website. All of those cases need something, something meaningful,
Yeah, yeah. Great question. So look, it's interesting. We're thinking about search engines at the market of search, like 40 years back, when you needed some some information, there were no searches, and you had the engines, and you had to go to library and ask friends, and that's how you kind of found information, right?

S Speaker 221:56Absolutely, that's already. The reason it works right now. The second part, that's, that's what we actually have built, the the evaluation is ranked people, right? Because we find for the people series, if you do the old school way, you just put some keywords, or, you know, some, some vector, use vector database and embeddings and find the closest vectors to each other. Well, you find millions of people. How do you decide that this should be first on the list and then the second one? Right? That's what Google was successful with back in the day, right? With page rank and all that stuff. That's exactly what we do. The idea of search we're building is that AI will evaluate people, rank them the way that the first person you see on the list will be pretty much the best person in the world for whatever you described. Yeah, then the second, 1/3, and so on.
Absolutely, that's already. The reason it works right now. The second part, that's, that's what we actually have built, the the evaluation is ranked people, right?

S Speaker 122:52And the more, let's say, you go towards your vision down the line, the more you're expanding from just recruiting use cases to use cases like dating, sourcing for venture capitalists and multiple other uses. Your evaluation engine and the pointers it should look at will change a little bit or will be more context aware. Are you? Do you think you will be able to do that at scale for very different applications. Will you have to custom build some of these solutions?

S Speaker 223:24Yeah, you know, we see that happening. The AI models we have in access are becoming smarter every day, and there you just can learn to and we have our internal models, right, that are evaluating things, yeah? And AI is becoming smarter and cheaper and faster. So yeah, basically we see that that's, that's, that's like our last six months were crazy successful for us because we spent almost year and a half trying to build that last evaluation part. But now many people use our tool for other things we were not focused on, not not recruitment, but lead generation, and they are happy. Well, even though we were not optimizing for that use case, it already starts to work for those use cases. And making a bit, putting more, you know, like Google has, like searching for images, right? Sometimes you start or they collect more data on movies, and when you search for a movie, or it's doable, like you can put more effort, but the general AI technology we're building, every time we upgrade it that all of the use cases are becoming better. You know, every update makes it better, but then you can specifically focus on verticals. Right now, our vertical is recruitment, but once we become bigger in more verticals to make it better,

S Speaker 225:30Recently, we've published this paper on how we evaluated our search and basically the paper is a scientific paper anyone can do and can repeat what we've done using all of the available technology on the market to see how it works. So I'll send back. Yes, if that's not enough, let me know. Of course, we can provide something
