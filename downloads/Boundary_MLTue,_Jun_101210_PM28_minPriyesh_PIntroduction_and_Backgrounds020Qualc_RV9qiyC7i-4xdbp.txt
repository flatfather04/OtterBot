S Speaker 10:40I wasn't. I wasn't an AI engineer. I was supposed to, but I could make it separate. Okay, okay. I hope things are fine. Yeah, things are good, analytical. Well, perfect. Great. To meet you again. I've done a little bit of research myself. So, so much better position to our conversation. Now, would love to start with, maybe I can give you a background about myself and the fund, and then would love to know a little bit more about you your background. How did you get to start something like this? So I'm pretty sure I've seen associated Qualcomm ventures being with the Fund for about a little bit more than a year now, prior to that, I was with mentor ventures for a short period of time, and then with Marcus ventures back in LA qualitarily from India, did my undergrad there, worked with a lot of policy starters before moving to the US. And now I'm in the venture scene for about three years or so. Qualcomm ventures, the fund itself, we've been around for 25 years now. This year would be our 25th anniversary. We have deployed more than two and a half billion dollars in capital, and it's a corporate venture arm of Qualcomm. So we invest in a lot of technologies. AI is primary, a big focus area for us. But apart from that, IoT, computer vision, industrial automation, robotics, to name a few sectors, AI is particularly more interesting for us, because over the last year, couple of years, I would say, Qualcomm has expanded quite a lot across different platforms, so not just a mobile silicon player. Now we have our chipsets and PCs, wearables, glasses, IoT devices. We even have a cloud inferencing platform, which is coming out very soon. So expanded across a lot of spaces, we feel, given that we have a place in the entire instance stack, we'd be able to support a lot of companies in the infrastructure, foundation, model and application layer downstream. So that's broadly at play. Any some multiple investments are hugging face, weights and biases, scale. Ai, anthropic, more recently, context. Ai, uh, in the application layer guide, some native investments that we're also starting to make. And then check sizes are typically between two to $15 million we prefer to come in somewhere around series A where we have some traction and some proof points around product market fit. But that's like a lot of speaking on my end, anything specific, like random

S Speaker 23:14I don't know if we have a sales tech, because, again, we just mostly talk to developers. Yeah, sales work very poorly with each day, but usually what we have is like, a good little thing that we send

stuff like, for example, like if you're using,
S Speaker 23:30like, a little smaller, like, if you're generating, if you're having a model generating code, for example, typically small models are gonna be really, really bad at generating code. But what we find is like, instead of like, weird way, we just let them all generate code in this way, yeah, whereas literally requiring the model just like, oh, it's saying, like, what are we saying ahead of time, it's an output, and it's actually operating the code in, like Python and like backing Python, right? And we still get all the correctness out of it without having to spend too much time thinking. But as a developer, so as an engineer, it still appears to me as pure, structured outputs, but the model will get to do what it needs to, to output really, really high quality context, like my swap is like local

S Speaker 24:16basically will just swap, and then it'll basically just make its plan, do its thing, and now the model is a model that we don't care what model is. Yeah, that's the whole point. The model is doing whatever it wants. And then we just, we just turn into my data model that you want, regardless of how those things are developing, exactly and and that's that's

S Speaker 14:56perfect. So now I was trying to sort of figure out, figure this out myself, how, how are you thinking about building a broader company over here? How are you thinking about go to market, pricing, it. What's the business model around? Is it? Does it sort of fall in the entire pitfall of it becoming a feature, not and not a company altogether,
perfect. So now I was trying to sort of figure out, figure this out myself, how, how are you thinking about building a broader company over here? How are you thinking about go to market, pricing, it.

S Speaker 25:18maybe? But I don't think so. I mean, fundamentally, people will write code like I think at some point, bits have to move on a machine, regardless of a model moves those bits or some of those bits are going to move. That means there will be some code that defines those bits. That code may be English, it may be Python, it may be text, it may be go, it doesn't matter. It's going to be some code we want to be the bits that move business logic of the machine 10 years from now, from all machines. And if you're those, if you are that, if you are those bits, then you probably will make a lot of money. Because today, the system that does that the most is AWS, yeah, and they move a lot of money because they own a layer of stack that no one wants to own. And it turns out it turns out it requires a lot of labor to build out that stack to that level of quality, and no one can really compete with fundamentally in machine learning, it's very similar. There's a lot of a stack that you have to go build out that is very hard to go do correctly. You need a lot of core engineering work. We all that work like part of that is the Bama language. No one is ever going to own the Bama language, except for language, except for us. It's open source. It's free. If people use it, that's great. It's just like, opted in, lock into the system that they are choosing to make you can't ever force someone to use it. But it turns out our attention is really high. We're like, 90% positive attention, because there's nothing better out there,
maybe? But I don't think so.

So you launched earlier in 2025 right?
So you launched earlier in 2025 right?
So you launched earlier in 2025 right?
S Speaker 27:09Yeah. We launched, like, I think we did a soft launch, like, last year sometime, and then we did a more, like, more of a launch
Yeah. We launched, like, I think we did a soft launch, like, last year sometime, and then we did a more, like, more of a launch
Yeah. We launched, like, I think we did a soft launch, like, last year sometime, and then we did a more, like, more of a launch
Yeah. We launched, like, I think we did a soft launch, like, last year sometime, and then we did a more, like, more of a launch
S Speaker 17:15earlier this year, yeah. And how has the traction been so far? Like, are you actually targeting individual developers across enterprises, medium businesses, are you sort of trying to go into partnership with a lot of agent developer frameworks and a lot of other mlops companies? How are you thinking about this? How do you think this will obviously,
earlier this year, yeah. And how has the traction been so far? Like, are you actually targeting individual developers across enterprises, medium businesses, are you sort of trying to go into partnership with a lot of agent developer frameworks and a lot of other mlops companies?

S Speaker 27:33we don't spend too much time thinking about this. I don't I disagree with the whole idea of GTM for developer tools. I think the best way to do GTM or developer tools, is word of mouth. We build tools that people love, and they tell their friends about it. That's how we've gotten every single user that we've got today. I barely do any marketing. The team is good. I post on my LinkedIn, which isn't that big. It's not really like what I would call like a good channel. Like, that's not and I think that shows the where people come from, baml. They come from baml by hearing about it from their friends. And it seems to work, because that's how I think the best developer tools have succeeded in the past. If you think about TypeScript, it's because your friends told you, stop being a dumb ass. Stop using JavaScript. Use TypeScript. Yeah. Why do you VS code? Your friends are like, stop being a dumb ass. Just use VS code, right? That's the goal. So, like, we could spend all the time that we want theorizing on the best GTM strategies. But honestly, like, when it comes to building hardcore tech, the best thing you can do is build tech, build a community that loves you and have them go advocate for you. So like, I see multiple times, like, people are, like, giving talks about their product, and they'll promote, shout out for like, bam. And I'm a ton of like, bigger companies are doing this. So there's like, some conferences happening this year where they're like, they're showing that they built it with ammo, and that is cool to me. Yeah, there's teams in IBM research that are just like, yep, we just use baml now for doing everything right? And it's not really, it's almost like a hand wave to people that use it, because it's so obvious stuff that they won't use it. So like, when I think about GT, I'm like, when we've talked to all of our investors, we talk about the same way, look, the goal is not to, like, get some hype wave and go do this. The goal is to build a wave that doesn't stop growing. Like the wave should just build and build and build and build and never stop. Yeah, the way you do that is by building the best fucking product you can
we don't spend too much time thinking about this. I don't I disagree with the whole idea of GTM for developer tools. I think the best way to do GTM or developer tools, is word of mouth.

The goal is to build a wave that doesn't stop growing. Like the wave should just build and build and build and build and never stop. Yeah, the way you do that is by building the best fucking product you can
we don't spend too much time thinking about this. I don't I disagree with the whole idea of GTM for developer tools. I think the best way to do GTM or developer tools, is word of mouth. We build tools that people love, and they tell their friends about it. That's how we've gotten every single user that we've got today. I barely do any marketing. The team is good. I post on my LinkedIn, which isn't that big. It's not really like what I would call like a good channel. Like, that's not and I think that shows the where people come from, baml. They come from baml by hearing about it from their friends. And it seems to work, because that's how I think the best developer tools have succeeded in the past. If you think about TypeScript, it's because your friends told you, stop being a dumb ass. Stop using JavaScript. Use TypeScript. Yeah. Why do you VS code? Your friends are like, stop being a dumb ass. Just use VS code, right? That's the goal. So, like, we could spend all the time that we want theorizing on the best GTM strategies. But honestly, like, when it comes to building hardcore tech, the best thing you can do is build tech, build a community that loves you and have them go advocate for you. So like, I see multiple times, like, people are, like, giving talks about their product, and they'll promote, shout out for like, bam. And I'm a ton of like, bigger companies are doing this. So there's like, some conferences happening this year where they're like, they're showing that they built it with ammo, and that is cool to me. Yeah, there's teams in IBM research that are just like, yep, we just use baml now for doing everything right? And it's not really, it's almost like a hand wave to people that use it, because it's so obvious stuff that they won't use it. So like, when I think about GT, I'm like, when we've talked to all of our investors, we talk about the same way, look, the goal is not to, like, get some hype wave and go do this.

S Speaker 19:20make sense. Makes sense. And I think I agree with what you're saying totally the OS extraction. Like, would you say discord communities? Os extraction is something that would drive most of the members down the line? Is that? How you envision word of mouth spreading? I don't really
make sense. Makes sense. And I think I agree with what you're saying totally the OS extraction. Like, would you say discord communities? Os extraction is something that would drive most of the members down the line? Is that? How you envision word of mouth spreading? I don't really

S Speaker 29:39know. To be completely honest, I have no idea how people found out about bamboo. Out about bamboo, yeah, last this time, we had eight people using Bammel, right? We're like 800 companies now, right? I have no idea how that happened. To be completely honest, at the beginning of last year, we are at 200 people, not companies. 200 people, yeah, at the beginning of at the end of this year, now, we're like 800 companies. I have no idea how that growth has happened. I don't really care. I just want to build the best product and, like, have people keep loving it and, like, the way that we measure metrics, like, we have all these kind Yeah, but the thing that I'm really measuring is like, Hey, what is the level of engagement we're getting from users? How often are users coming back to baml? Because I don't want a funnel where we just bring people in and we lose them. I want, like, a retentive I want a non leaky system, because in the AI frameworks, everyone, like, gets 10,000 users, and three months later they have zero. I agree. I don't care about building that kind of business because, like, that's just not worth it. It's such a waste of time. And

S Speaker 110:38well, in your mind, how does the product roadmap evolve from here? What all do you plan to be building down the line? Any milestones that you have in your mind? Yeah, we have

S Speaker 210:48some exciting ones. We're gonna announce them later. But like, we have some really, really cool things that are gonna be announced. We have some new algorithms that we've just, like, the parsing thing I showed you. We have some new algorithms that we're gonna be announcing pretty soon too, and that's gonna be really fun.

S Speaker 111:04the year. Okay, okay, very exciting. Broadly, in what space, though, if you can sort of take me through how you are thinking about the product evolving, I understand, maybe not the exact features, but

S Speaker 211:14it's more like a holistic suite of what it means to be an ML developer in, like, 2020 I wouldn't even say 2025 I'll say, like, what do you need as an ML? What does an ML developer need in like, 2020s, 2030, and that's kind of how we think about it. I think there's some businesses where people are building for needs of today, and those are fine businesses. But I think the businesses that win the most are the ones where the the team has has a perspective on the future, yeah, and you build for where the world will be at two years from now, three years from now, because that's how you build something that people can't catch up to. Well,
it's more like a holistic suite of what it means to be an ML developer in, like, 2020 I wouldn't even say 2025 I'll say, like, what do you need as an ML?

Well,
S Speaker 111:51I agree. I agree. The internal thesis we have in our team is probably invest in tech, which just barely works today, and probably with the thing of would be the thing in a couple of years. So I agree with what you're saying. That makes sense. And how big is the team today? We're seven people today, all based in SF, Seattle, Seattle, okay,
I agree. I agree. The internal thesis we have in our team is probably invest in tech, which just barely works today, and probably with the thing of would be the thing in a couple of years.

So I agree with what you're saying. That makes sense. And how big is the team today? We're seven people today, all based in SF, Seattle, Seattle, okay,
S Speaker 212:13yeah, we need to hire like core systems engineers, people that understand, like compilers, languages, like things that are not common in SF, yeah, a lot more common in Seattle, where you like, at a lot of core AWS team call a lot of the TypeScript team VS code team, they all sit around here, right? So we leverage that out
yeah, we need to hire like core systems engineers, people that understand, like compilers, languages, like things that are not common in SF, yeah, a lot more common in Seattle, where you like, at a lot of core AWS team call a lot of the TypeScript team VS code team, they all sit around here, right?

S Speaker 112:29here. Interesting, makes sense, and and all engineers you mentioned, right? Yeah,
here. Interesting, makes sense, and and all engineers you mentioned, right? Yeah,
here. Interesting, makes sense, and and all engineers you mentioned, right? Yeah,
here. Interesting, makes sense, and and all engineers you mentioned, right? Yeah,
S Speaker 113:11that's an interesting thesis, the first time I'm hearing about it, but wow, that's

that's an interesting thesis, the first time I'm hearing about it, but wow, that's
S Speaker 213:17fun. We ever really like to be completely honest, like to be completely honest, like, building a programming language is the dumbest idea ever. Like, there's not that many that have succeeded. It's literally single handed. Yeah, right. But the ones that won have won so fucking big because they capture the hearts of developers. Like you have fanatics that will look at you and be like, you have to read and go, No, you have to write. Ross, people will just argue about it for fun and for free. They basically, like, evangelize your product for you. And if you can build that sort of love and community, then you can do what Databricks did with Spark, where they basically use Spark to leverage an entire data platform that is massive and will probably 10x again. And like, if you didn't invest in Spark on day one, you just don't have a chance, right? It's just not it's just not the way it works if you don't invest in these systems on that point, because that's it's such a long form bet. Because in hindsight, it's like, yeah, it's obvious, Spark makes sense, yeah? But in that moment, it's like, no, that's way too big of a bet. You can't do that. Same with TerraForm, way too big a bet. You can't do that. And like, when TypeScript, when JavaScript first happened, and people were like, Oh, our back end developers will always learn JavaScript, that's true. And the conclusion to that was, Oh, why don't we just make JavaScript a back end language, then our developers can learn JavaScript, nothing else. And our goal with baml is, oh, look, make our back end developers learn baml. And two years from now, you can ask, Oh, why don't we just write the whole app in baml? Why do we even need I thought that should go why don't why do we need any of

S Speaker 215:05two or three years, right now? Oh, okay, we just don't spend money. We hire people like 100k like people turn down like eight, 700k job offers to work for Hunter K with us. Oh,
two or three years, right now? Oh, okay, we just don't spend money. We hire people like 100k like people turn down like eight, 700k job offers to work for Hunter K with us. Oh,

S Speaker 215:41the most useful ones are, like, if you have a port code that's kind of struggling with LM accuracy of some time for some of their use cases, I think most of them even internally. What do you think has the most clickable one? Then, like, super happy to just chat with them and show them how to go. Like, if they're down, you can send them that blog post. Yeah, the thing that I just linked in the chat, and if they want to have, like, a 15 minute conversation, I'd be happy to show them how much better than faster teams are going to iterate, and how much better the accuracy will be in about 15 to 20 minutes for their AI pipeline. That's roughly what it takes if they have the time. But of course, like, I know people are always like, being shown, like, tons of things, so, like, don't understand, but it's really like, what we found, for example, is we worked with a finance company, and they used to process PDFs using, like, a vendor. Yeah, they reduced, and they paid the vendor seven figures theater to go process like, bank statement PDFs. We showed them how to do with llms, no fine tuning, no nothing. Just use base LLM as they are, and these are the worst models, about like seven months ago. Yeah, so not even models. Yeah, they're able to process 100 page bank statements with zero sense of error.

But of course, like, I know people are always like, being shown, like, tons of things, so, like, don't understand, but it's really like, what we found, for example, is we worked with a finance company, and they used to process PDFs using, like, a vendor. Yeah, they reduced, and they paid the vendor seven figures theater to go process like, bank statement PDFs. We showed them how to do with llms, no fine tuning, no nothing. Just use base LLM as they are, and these are the worst models, about like seven months ago. Yeah, so not even models. Yeah, they're able to process 100 page bank statements with zero sense of error.
the most useful ones are, like, if you have a port code that's kind of struggling with LM accuracy of some time for some of their use cases, I think most of them even internally. What do you think has the most clickable one? Then, like, super happy to just chat with them and show them how to go. Like, if they're down, you can send them that blog post. Yeah, the thing that I just linked in the chat, and if they want to have, like, a 15 minute conversation, I'd be happy to show them how much better than faster teams are going to iterate, and how much better the accuracy will be in about 15 to 20 minutes for their AI pipeline.

Like, we want to make money on the product, on baml, and if people love baml, they will pay us. Like, there's multiple customers that are, like, paying, trying to pay us more for the SaaS product that we have right now. And it's not that we don't want to take the money, it's just that we can't rush building certain things, yeah, because the Tech has to be built correctly. If we build it wrong, it's a liability, not an asset. And that is really important for my fundamental tech. And that's just a perspective that we

Can you also take a look at Qualcomm AI hub when you get a chance, and let me know if that is worth interest from a partnership point of view, I can possibly connect you to few members on the team which lead those initiatives.

S Speaker 221:20in to die. And like, if I'm an AI, if I'm an existing company, as a kind of software, I'm not going to spin off Python arm, just use AI. I spent all my time making my back end and go so really fast I want to go to use go for AI too. Like, it's absurd that I can't do that, right? That's like, the stance that we have taken is like, That is absurd, and that will not be true. So we're going to solve that problem for everything. So regardless of whether you're Python shop, TypeScript, shop, Java, shop, use demo, you get the benefits of it, just like, regardless of what, whether you're back in the Python TypeScript, Java, Go, use TypeScript for writing your website. Use them for writing. And as more and more people use it. When will the package manager? When Qualcomm ships out a package for using some of their models with better native support, people import it, and now they get the benefit. We build an ecosystem that's bigger and bigger and bigger, but people shipping their own Neo forge will ship a package. We know those guys really well. They do they do content for us all time, so they love the idea of them and like that's like, the premise that we have. It's like, we don't, we don't ever pay for marketing opportunities. It's not worth it. I hate them. I think they're fake. And for developer tools, like, people get the sense of that they're fake, and you could tell when someone's authentically vouching for something which is being paid for. So like, all the content that's ever been out for Bama has been zero paid content, including all the speaker opportunities that we've had because, like, it's not

S Speaker 223:03probably more important than usage. And then I really target the complexity of questions being asked in the community. It's like, how complex are we getting? Like, we started a YouTube channel about like a month ago. We no views, no subscribers, no posting anywhere. We have like, 10,000 views, average eight minutes of you, right? And all I do is I post once a week. I post one hour long session once a week. And I was like, Why the fuck are people listening to this? But they do, and that's cool, right? And like, in the chat, people are like, Yeah, I love this. I switched over a whole company to this. And like, we're just moving faster. And like, that is, that's the kind of thing I look for, is like, when we introduce a new and then, like, there's this, like, Discord that happened just yesterday where this user was having a really, really fun it was actually really interesting. This person was just, like, we had a really, really, like, multi 100 message about this. Like, I'm trying to wrap my head around them. I don't get it. And like, in the end, what I was on a flight. So I didn't respond for a while. So I described it. The person was like, here's my code. Can you just go do this? I literally just posted a YouTube video and be porting the code over. Like, I literally just posted YouTube videos to code. He's like, I get it. And like, and like, I started playing. Like, he played with it. And he was like, this is really cool. I like, that was a conclusion. But, like, just because we don't have the messaging right today, just it just a matter of, like, we just figured out the right way to message it, yeah, I do know when someone sees their code converted to them, all they get right? And normally that would be hard, but because of AI, that's not even that hard, we just have to build a tool that does that for you. Yes, right? So, like, that's kind of the direction that we want to go in. It's like, just make it really easy for people to use whatever they want, however they want, in with the best tooling possible.
probably more important than usage. And then I really target the complexity of questions being asked in the community. It's like, how complex are we getting?

S Speaker 124:47Very, very interesting. Bravo, very interesting set of things. Love, love how you're thinking about it. Would would love to have a chat sometime when you when you are next in SF, let me know. And let me also get back to some of the things that I mentioned on my end.

S Speaker 225:03Yeah, if you I'd love to see if you have, like, one or two podcasts that might be relevant for our conversation. And possibly May, I have to see how relevant that is. Like, I think the best thing to do is, literally just, if you really want to get a sense for how good BAM was, or what it's useful for, just go on the discord and ask, right, yeah, or, like, go read messages on the discord. You'll get a sense for what baml is, right, or find and then, if you have an engineer you trust, have them go use baml, right, and have them play around with for about two hours. If you've never seen go, and you make a judgment on go in less than two hours, you can't really, you don't know, you got to write the go COVID, really. And that's kind of our theory, too. It's like, with investors that we worked in, like, the ones that we've we've been really lucky is, like, we have a lot of engineers that love baml, that have put checks in, which is really fun, yeah. But generally, like, we love people that are, like, technically aligned, because I've worked with certain investors and, like, I have certain friends who couldn't fucking been pressured to, like, go make money earlier, but for certain products that doesn't work. Like, if Amazon started squeezing the dime out, like, way earlier than they did, they would be way smaller than they are today.
Yeah, if you I'd love to see if you have, like, one or two podcasts that might be relevant for our conversation. And possibly May, I have to see how relevant that is.

You'll get a sense for what baml is, right, or find and then, if you have an engineer you trust, have them go use baml, right, and have them play around with for about two hours. If you've never seen go, and you make a judgment on go in less than two hours, you can't really, you don't know, you got to write the go COVID, really. And that's kind of our theory, too. It's like, with investors that we worked in, like, the ones that we've we've been really lucky is, like, we have a lot of engineers that love baml, that have put checks in, which is really fun, yeah. But generally, like, we love people that are, like, technically aligned, because I've worked with certain investors and, like, I have certain friends who couldn't fucking been pressured to, like, go make money earlier, but for certain products that doesn't work. Like, if Amazon started squeezing the dime out, like, way earlier than they did, they would be way smaller than they are today.

S Speaker 126:30opinion, interesting, though. I think maybe if things go the way you're suggesting they will, you probably would end up raising sometimes sooner than the two and three years timeline. But, but but when that happens, keep me posted. Would love to sort of have a chat again around that as well. Yeah,

S Speaker 226:44we'll do Yeah, right now. I just don't want to think about it. Yeah, totally, totally makes sense the best time to say that. And we got preempted, like, earlier this year for like, 10 million bucks. Yeah, we ended up turning that down. And just because, like, it's just a process, I don't, it's not the way I do business. I don't really want to, like, take an offer and, like, re negative. Like, it's not the goal. Who cares about micro optimizing on this scale, right? Like, the thing that matters to, like, get the right people on board, spend time growing the user base and customer base, and that's our goal. Yeah, it's like, right people, right? Like, like, write ethos around the company and go build for that. And, like, that's it's a very long term bet. Like, as far as I can tell, the team is going to stick with us. I'm going to stick on this. My COVID is going to stick on this. Looks like we have the dice to roll, and let's roll the long dice. Not many people can do that, and
