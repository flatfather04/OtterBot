It is a conflict. But, you know, sometimes you guys want to hit your bets in more than one company, right? Yeah, use technologies, right?

from you exactly. So I think, to be honest, I think whatever they have better, AI computer vision, I think they have done amazing combination of IoT tracking, the whole landing, right? But we're really good at we have an amazing engine. Don't have a chassis, we don't like, we just have an amazing product liquidation engine. That's our heart. So I think it will be a good compliment to them as well. I've done due diligence. I know all the other spaces, there's a couple companies in the Bay Area that are also been like, I Bay Area that are also everything inside we have is a million times more. And I know we also have some blocking, deep blocking patents. And I want to say that because I want to make sure our value is there. We're not there to become the icons. We're there to get older AI inside every computer vision retail model. That's where we're going from, as well as welcome. You want the Qualcomm chipset in everything. Every camera was our ODM, so we packaged the large security cameras to put some

in modules ring. But at the end, I chose, I told my my CEO, my student, let's I want to be acquired by a different company. And we went in retail. So I became the chief AI service, Nova robotics, I don't know if you know them. We were in 15 Walmart stores that they were doing robots. They couldn't meet the timing. SLA, they couldn't scale. I scaled immediately. Team scale them to 550 robots in 550 Walmart stores, right? So that's why I'm here. Walmart came back to me. So after a year and a half, of them working with us and then preparing their own two $50 million from the team and everyone else out in the field, including, I mean, they benchmarked mastery. They've standard. They benchmark everyone they chose up. So that's where the that's where the story starts. So ladies, start because I want to make sure, you know, I get through everything. I know you have a lot of questions. You'd want to make sure I so this is more, more business front loaded, but then I'll go to the cool stuff afterwards for sure. You know, the, you know the value? I mean, you know, I don't need to tell you that just straight, although it's 112 billion to NRF and check out staffing, right? And that's a whole I find thing. So you know why it's important. This is the pilot that we did with Walmart. This is the system they built. This is, this is public. This is their LinkedIn page. This is the first version. They built everything themselves. We did the computer vision part. This was, this was in the in the Bentonville store, 3164 where John Furner himself shops. So this is their own Walmart class app. They're chef and music their cell phone. And then basically they go in, they put the code and it will visually check what's on the card. Again, 12 items or less. It's not meant to be full cards, but it was full cards. They were just happy to match whatever the top right. If the deal goes for the fast shoppers and it does RFID tricks, RFID and computer vision together. We didn't do the RFID. We didn't do the computer vision here. They also did symbology, so they were also reading barcodes through image again, that's commodity. We didn't do that image matching, but you can see the matching was very fast, right? I mean, they can see part. Ai

So check out cell checkout shrink, shelf monitoring, analytics, cart tracking, trucker tracking, Planet over vacation, love prevention, car in cart, out of cart. We can be anywhere. We can be on a mobile device. I have everything running the Raspberry Pi and pregnant pi, right? We started working with Halo HP, because in December, in one month, we put our algorithm to Halo, and we're working now, and I'll show you Raspberry Pi demo so I don't need to Walmart, Jujitsu HP, data logic is another partner we're working with right now. Very, very, very hard. CBOs came to us. We have three point with agent for Ace. Some of my students created a company in Saudi Arabia that will go in the Middle East. And there's even Amazon. Fresh came to me a week ago. Literally, they want to figure out what we're doing. We're talking to two divisions in Amazon. In every demo I will show you, I have ingested 250,000 products by simply downloading the web image from the walmart.com and the only time it doesn't work is when the CPG image is does not look at the product. Sometimes it just is not. It's just an outdated image. Like, seriously out there, like night and day. If it isn't, I can match it. So onboarding for me is like this, if I work in one store, I don't need to do anything for you to work another store. I don't care if your cameras are different. I don't care if your camera angles are different. I don't care about lighting. Our models are invariant to

as long as we're trying to recognize anything that's a front right or near from like any angle, yeah, up to like five degrees, right? Yeah. Otherwise, I need to have, if I'm trying to match it from the top or back, I need those images, but I need one image per spot, precise, basically, interesting.

We were, we again. We just started doing December. They integrated us into their system. So now for this, and HP are selling our are going out and selling our technology, which is great. And they were, we were in urises, in Dusseldorf, and NRF both were there. There was nga and just IC West. Last week, Halo was promoting our technology with hp, and we built the body cap for them too. So you know the importance why we're the best. I gave the group for 12 or 20 years. Carnegie Mellon, post 25 three letter agencies. You we won the Outstanding award, or AI from the Secretary of the Army in 2020 for the best facial recognition and face detection work. And they benchmark Amazon recognition everything in the field. We have a letter from the Under Secretary here on the right, and actually got an award for interview yourself. Go to our website, you'll see other awards. We have, event of the year award. I have over 50 patents. I have close to 80 patents on computer vision and retail.

Speaker 2
well. Yeah. So I was also the chief AI scientist. Of us, though we're a small and I was, I was lucky that I left before it went right, too much down.
well. Yeah. So I was also the chief AI scientist. Of us, though we're a small and I was, I was lucky that I left before it went right, too much down.
well. Yeah. So I was also the chief AI scientist. Of us, though we're a small and I was, I was lucky that I left before it went right, too much down.
well. Yeah. So I was also the chief AI scientist. Of us, though we're a small and I was, I was lucky that I left before it went right, too much down.
So actually, that's how I know you guys.
So actually, that's how I know you guys.
So actually, that's how I know you guys.
So actually, that's how I know you guys.
Speaker 1
You know, yeah, a lot of, lot of touch points. Then I guess that's great.
You know, yeah, a lot of, lot of touch points. Then I guess that's great.
You know, yeah, a lot of, lot of touch points. Then I guess that's great.
You know, yeah, a lot of, lot of touch points. Then I guess that's great.
Speaker 2
Yeah, and bossa nova, number one thing is the retail we scaled. I scaled my team. We're we actually dispatched the whole team after six months. They just wanted me and the Carnegie Mellon team. That's it. With all their AI, I really ground up and I scaled them to 550 stores without one change of code in the AI,
Yeah, and bossa nova, number one thing is the retail we scaled. I scaled my team. We're we actually dispatched the whole team after six months. They just wanted me and the Carnegie Mellon team.

nothing. The road was running three times a day.

Speaker 2
We have every three letter agency we've worked for. I mean, that's, that's the word IP. Was all $55 million of CMU that I've taken that IP and I've translated into retail space, right? And if you go to web page, you'll see our work. You know, Boston Marathon case we did. We were 60 minutes multiple times of CNN. We developed the world's first long range Iris system in 2013 I can do Iris 13 meters away, 40 feet I literally, I'm thinking, I knew, go to Google records and put that in there, and I'm going to do that. So you'll see our work. We're out there giving multiple talks at World Economic Forum for our computer vision work. Most of work was funded by General James Richardson the last couple years, and you know, he retired about a year ago. He's on my board, so don't take my word for it. Ask a four star general. Again, we're accurate. We started working with Walmart on the Jetson or in AGX, Fuji su pushed us to get into a nano. And we did. We're running real time on a 250,000 product skill list. HP pushes to go to 8808. Halo, 8l. I can run on an 8l A sub $70 MSRP comes to considerator. So if I can trick you, do that, I can, for sure, do this on a Beretta. And welcome. Yeah. I need money. I need support. We don't have, like, that's, you know, we've only raised 2.2 million, and we got 2.2 million. So we're doing seeds. We're doing a seat right now, yeah, service. I want to switch now to a different screen to show you demos. And
We have every three letter agency we've worked for. I mean, that's, that's the word IP. Was all $55 million of CMU that I've taken that IP and I've translated into retail space, right? And if you go to web page, you'll see our work. You know, Boston Marathon case we did. We were 60 minutes multiple times of CNN. We developed the world's first long range Iris system in 2013 I can do Iris 13 meters away, 40 feet I literally, I'm thinking, I knew, go to Google records and put that in there, and I'm going to do that. So you'll see our work. We're out there giving multiple talks at World Economic Forum for our computer vision work. Most of work was funded by General James Richardson the last couple years, and you know, he retired about a year ago. He's on my board, so don't take my word for it. Ask a four star general.

here we build a very simple web app. We're actually doing checkout by taking a picture of the product is recognizing it in our initial virtual cache. The UI scrap is just functional, that's all, yeah. The goal is to actually verify the card. So think of Costco scenario, or even Walmart scenario, right? So then you get a barcode, and then you're logging Do you walk towards the end the exit, there's a camera you present yourself with anywhere you get the QR code pulls up the receipt, identifies those are currently there. What happens if I put other products that I didn't pay for you?

This is giant eagle. You know, we have Walmart catalogs. That's 90% of all products from any other Okay, these are the hard ones, right? When you go to condiments, look at the angles, look at the variations, and I'll even go to like some more here. Some of these. You'll see that there. Well, there. I didn't even, I didn't even sign this. The enrollment images, they're just downloaded. Yeah, look this. This house Italian looks different. The sauce color is different. We're still matching it, even though I didn't clear out this, and I'm not doing OCR at all. Your great thing is, I found this, you know, made jar of mayo, right? We found this. Make a jar here. So now we can tell associate, hey, you know, go, take this misplaced items. Go to so that's, that's that I want to show you the cool stuff, no augmented reality. I can put them. I have a simple camera on a radio glasses, and I can go and look around and actually do this is real time,

this is very interesting. Marja, so what's your go to market plan going ahead? Do you, if I'm understanding this correctly, you're working with Walmarts and HPs of the world today, and they're co designing the hardware with your software stack. How do you plan to scale this down the line in terms of customers, in terms of customers, also, what would be the business model? Would you just be a model provider? Would you be a platform? Would you tie up with a lot of different hardware form factors? How are you thinking about it. We

For you guys, I'll be wherever, whatever platform. You know, data logic is using you guys. I do their logic. Their logic is using you guys on their on cart. Right? Welcome Jeff. I want to port that there. I just had this schedule a long time with the CP. I told you the venture arm tomorrow, right?

Speaker 1
That's my problem. Understood. That's a good problem to have, though. But I'd say my earlier in the slides, you had a slide on how you're pricing this. Can you explain that to me a little bit more? I could not get it from the table right away.

Speaker 2
So like the like, this one, yes, this was Walmart. MSA, yeah. Walmart is a Walmart's a one off. I'm not gonna charge the same thing. Like, when I go to volume, I made a big discount to Walmart just because they're my they're my springboard. The guys, Walmart shows us they did that. I'm giving them extra low price so it will scale for convenience stores. I'm not. I'm charging $1,000 per per camera per month. And when I do that, what you'll see is that convenience stores, the these OEMs, start overtaking Walmart,

Like, when I go to volume, I made a big discount to Walmart just because they're my they're my springboard. The guys, Walmart shows us they did that. I'm giving them extra low price so it will scale for convenience stores. I'm not. I'm charging $1,000 per per camera per month. And when I do that, what you'll see is that convenience stores, the these OEMs, start overtaking Walmart,

that. That's our secret sauce. Yeah, makes sense. We have some very again, I have over 50 patents, close to 80. We probably find about 85 somewhere there. We have a good chunk of them already accepted, including some key blocking one. Yeah,
that. That's our secret sauce. Yeah, makes sense. We have some very again, I have over 50 patents, close to 80. We probably find about 85 somewhere there. We have a good chunk of them already accepted, including some key blocking one. Yeah,

Speaker 1
yeah. The connection I'm trying to build Mario's here is the demo wise, it seems working really well against all the other demos I've seen for from similar players. I would possibly like to build a benchmarking table on how electron versus X, Y and Z across different parameters, and that's where I'm trying to get at so I was trying to see if there are variables or different spaces I can pull information from to build a table like that myself.

Speaker 1
you. Got it, and between the current customers you have today, what's the expansion size for them and the pipe and the revenue that you're projecting for this year? How much of that would be from expansion? How much of that would be new customers?

Speaker 2
So this is what I'm expecting. You know, I we will be entering some pilots almost immediately, given that summer is going to be slow, right? Other retailers, I'm not expecting too much in 2025 there's only like two quarters left, yeah, but we're starting now in the summer, we'll maybe get so not much, but really ramping up in 2026 remember, we've not been that long. We've not been we've not been long that much. We've only had $2.2 million in actual raise, and we made 2.5 in actual revenue. Yeah. I mean, don't look at the absolute number. Look at our gradient. Look at how fast we're going give us gas money and will space excited here,
So this is what I'm expecting. You know, I we will be entering some pilots almost immediately, given that summer is going to be slow, right?

that's interesting. How big around are you planning to raise
that's interesting. How big around are you planning to raise
that's interesting. How big around are you planning to raise
that's interesting. How big around are you planning to raise
7 million? I want 7
Speaker 1
million. If I can get more, I'll take more. Yeah. And in what stage are you in raising right now? Do you have a plan? Okay, so you still, because our process typically takes four to five weeks. Just wanted to know that we have a amount of time to dispose. Yeah, some some funds. More. Financial funds move faster. But just wanted to mention that that's that's interesting. Let me do a little bit more work on my end. Come back with a few follow up questions. And then I would like to involve one more member of my team who has, who has been in the camera business for Qualcomm for couple of decades. He's the best person to evaluate that. And then we can have a follow up conversation, including Tushar.

Speaker 2
And again, you should look at the IP portfolio. Really. All this is great, but once you see the strength of rocket portfolio, it's something that will compliment your other adventures as well. Yeah, I don't see myself as a threat. I see myself as a great compliment. And add on, if you want to dominate the market, Army might be in my team at your silver bullet, the binding of all CMU.

Speaker 1
That's that's the most interesting part to note, because, in that way, it does not seem a direct competition to ifI. That makes a lot of sense. Yep, yep, go ahead. Mark, right, yes. Can you
That's that's the most interesting part to note, because, in that way, it does not seem a direct competition to ifI. That makes a lot of sense. Yep, yep, go ahead. Mark, right, yes. Can you

hardware? I'm not setting hardware. Yep, makes sense. I i arm hardware.
Speaker 1
Speaker 1
Speaker 2
It is a conflict. But, you know, sometimes you guys want to hit your bets in more than one company, right? Yeah, use technologies, right?
Speaker 1
Right? Is more. I would say an IoT plus computer vision is less. So they have their own cameras and they install that. So I think there's a different angle here, but we'll upload some more
Speaker 2
from you exactly. So I think, to be honest, I think whatever they have better, AI computer vision, I think they have done amazing combination of IoT tracking, the whole landing, right? But we're really good at we have an amazing engine. Don't have a chassis, we don't like, we just have an amazing product liquidation engine. That's our heart. So I think it will be a good compliment to them as well. I've done due diligence. I know all the other spaces, there's a couple companies in the Bay Area that are also been like, I Bay Area that are also everything inside we have is a million times more. And I know we also have some blocking, deep blocking patents. And I want to say that because I want to make sure our value is there. We're not there to become the icons. We're there to get older AI inside every computer vision retail model. That's where we're going from, as well as welcome. You want the Qualcomm chipset in everything. Every camera was our ODM, so we packaged the large security cameras to put some
right and what was the
company calling
Speaker 2
in modules ring. But at the end, I chose, I told my my CEO, my student, let's I want to be acquired by a different company. And we went in retail. So I became the chief AI service, Nova robotics, I don't know if you know them. We were in 15 Walmart stores that they were doing robots. They couldn't meet the timing. SLA, they couldn't scale. I scaled immediately. Team scale them to 550 robots in 550 Walmart stores, right? So that's why I'm here. Walmart came back to me. So after a year and a half, of them working with us and then preparing their own two $50 million from the team and everyone else out in the field, including, I mean, they benchmarked mastery. They've standard. They benchmark everyone they chose up. So that's where the that's where the story starts. So ladies, start because I want to make sure, you know, I get through everything. I know you have a lot of questions. You'd want to make sure I so this is more, more business front loaded, but then I'll go to the cool stuff afterwards for sure. You know, the, you know the value? I mean, you know, I don't need to tell you that just straight, although it's 112 billion to NRF and check out staffing, right? And that's a whole I find thing. So you know why it's important. This is the pilot that we did with Walmart. This is the system they built. This is, this is public. This is their LinkedIn page. This is the first version. They built everything themselves. We did the computer vision part. This was, this was in the in the Bentonville store, 3164 where John Furner himself shops. So this is their own Walmart class app. They're chef and music their cell phone. And then basically they go in, they put the code and it will visually check what's on the card. Again, 12 items or less. It's not meant to be full cards, but it was full cards. They were just happy to match whatever the top right. If the deal goes for the fast shoppers and it does RFID tricks, RFID and computer vision together. We didn't do the RFID. We didn't do the computer vision here. They also did symbology, so they were also reading barcodes through image again, that's commodity. We didn't do that image matching, but you can see the matching was very fast, right? I mean, they can see part. Ai
Speaker 3
check your groceries here. Ai checks everything. It says you're good to go. So that
Speaker 2
Yeah, I get that for sure. There's a big opportunity here.
Speaker 2
So check out cell checkout shrink, shelf monitoring, analytics, cart tracking, trucker tracking, Planet over vacation, love prevention, car in cart, out of cart. We can be anywhere. We can be on a mobile device. I have everything running the Raspberry Pi and pregnant pi, right? We started working with Halo HP, because in December, in one month, we put our algorithm to Halo, and we're working now, and I'll show you Raspberry Pi demo so I don't need to Walmart, Jujitsu HP, data logic is another partner we're working with right now. Very, very, very hard. CBOs came to us. We have three point with agent for Ace. Some of my students created a company in Saudi Arabia that will go in the Middle East. And there's even Amazon. Fresh came to me a week ago. Literally, they want to figure out what we're doing. We're talking to two divisions in Amazon. In every demo I will show you, I have ingested 250,000 products by simply downloading the web image from the walmart.com and the only time it doesn't work is when the CPG image is does not look at the product. Sometimes it just is not. It's just an outdated image. Like, seriously out there, like night and day. If it isn't, I can match it. So onboarding for me is like this, if I work in one store, I don't need to do anything for you to work another store. I don't care if your cameras are different. I don't care if your camera angles are different. I don't care about lighting. Our models are invariant to
Speaker 1
that. That's very interesting. So that's, that's one image per product would suffice for you? Yes,
Speaker 2
as long as we're trying to recognize anything that's a front right or near from like any angle, yeah, up to like five degrees, right? Yeah. Otherwise, I need to have, if I'm trying to match it from the top or back, I need those images, but I need one image per spot, precise, basically, interesting.
HP, Fujitsu.
Speaker 2
We were, we again. We just started doing December. They integrated us into their system. So now for this, and HP are selling our are going out and selling our technology, which is great. And they were, we were in urises, in Dusseldorf, and NRF both were there. There was nga and just IC West. Last week, Halo was promoting our technology with hp, and we built the body cap for them too. So you know the importance why we're the best. I gave the group for 12 or 20 years. Carnegie Mellon, post 25 three letter agencies. You we won the Outstanding award, or AI from the Secretary of the Army in 2020 for the best facial recognition and face detection work. And they benchmark Amazon recognition everything in the field. We have a letter from the Under Secretary here on the right, and actually got an award for interview yourself. Go to our website, you'll see other awards. We have, event of the year award. I have over 50 patents. I have close to 80 patents on computer vision and retail.
Speaker 1
In fact, was to over here is one of our portfolio companies as
Speaker 2
well. Yeah. So I was also the chief AI scientist. Of us, though we're a small and I was, I was lucky that I left before it went right, too much down.
So actually, that's how I know you guys.
Speaker 1
You know, yeah, a lot of, lot of touch points. Then I guess that's great.
Speaker 2
Yeah, and bossa nova, number one thing is the retail we scaled. I scaled my team. We're we actually dispatched the whole team after six months. They just wanted me and the Carnegie Mellon team. That's it. With all their AI, I really ground up and I scaled them to 550 stores without one change of code in the AI,
nothing. The road was running three times a day.
Speaker 2
We have every three letter agency we've worked for. I mean, that's, that's the word IP. Was all $55 million of CMU that I've taken that IP and I've translated into retail space, right? And if you go to web page, you'll see our work. You know, Boston Marathon case we did. We were 60 minutes multiple times of CNN. We developed the world's first long range Iris system in 2013 I can do Iris 13 meters away, 40 feet I literally, I'm thinking, I knew, go to Google records and put that in there, and I'm going to do that. So you'll see our work. We're out there giving multiple talks at World Economic Forum for our computer vision work. Most of work was funded by General James Richardson the last couple years, and you know, he retired about a year ago. He's on my board, so don't take my word for it. Ask a four star general. Again, we're accurate. We started working with Walmart on the Jetson or in AGX, Fuji su pushed us to get into a nano. And we did. We're running real time on a 250,000 product skill list. HP pushes to go to 8808. Halo, 8l. I can run on an 8l A sub $70 MSRP comes to considerator. So if I can trick you, do that, I can, for sure, do this on a Beretta. And welcome. Yeah. I need money. I need support. We don't have, like, that's, you know, we've only raised 2.2 million, and we got 2.2 million. So we're doing seeds. We're doing a seat right now, yeah, service. I want to switch now to a different screen to show you demos. And
Speaker 1
now, yes, you mentioned you've raised 2.2 was that institutional money? Was that mostly angels, friends and family.
Speaker 2
Mix, some friends, some institutional, some some angel.
Speaker 1
Was around price. Do you have a valuation in mind today? It was a sage 12 Bill cap, 12 million. Okay,
Speaker 2
and I'm open discussion for now. I'm shooting for about 3035, now for discussion only because we have patents. There's technology, not just attraction. We're getting error, but we actually also have patents. So I think, you know, we can raise something good. Let me start. This is on the Raspberry Pi. Do
this is Raspberry Pi, and I email.
Speaker 2
I have 250,000 products in my database. That's just it there,
silly AutoCAD,
Speaker 2
you know, fine grain, you know, all the different catch ups, right? I'm really stressing it, right? I'll stress before anyone else stressing my system. Why? Because we've done facial recognition. Our work was used to fight ISIS. We can enroll someone from a drone and mash them robustly against millions. I can, for sure, enroll a product and find it, given that as an age, it doesn't change, right, other than seasonal packaging, but you have to be a role, right?
So that's that's one dimensional. Sorry, okay,
Speaker 2
And it's that's fairly easy, right? Because this is a reminder,
it. This is a reminder. Reminder.
Sorry, this is, you know what? This is where things just always,
Speaker 2
let me lower this. Okay? This is our system with hp. Again, we just basically plugged in the 808 into and that's what they wanted, right?
Multiple products you
Speaker 2
again, same thing you've seen this. This is Fujitsu ready, like just a nano.
Speaker 2
Again. This is showing fine grain, all the different Reese's cups, all the different variations.
Simple image, CPG,
Speaker 2
I have close to 20 people working funding my lab at CMU, mixture of engineers in Ultra and at CMU King, and so we have a COVID space at CMU, leveraging GPUs. Have a lot of infrastructure, so we can do this for Jesus. Wanted one item at a time. That's fine. I act
Speaker 2
like this is showing large, you know, large scale, just, you know, just show you a whole variety of different products, not just, you know, like I want to show like, the volume like, just like, see like, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds, probably just thrown at it, right? I want to make sure I go to more things for sure.
But you you get the idea.
Speaker 2
here we build a very simple web app. We're actually doing checkout by taking a picture of the product is recognizing it in our initial virtual cache. The UI scrap is just functional, that's all, yeah. The goal is to actually verify the card. So think of Costco scenario, or even Walmart scenario, right? So then you get a barcode, and then you're logging Do you walk towards the end the exit, there's a camera you present yourself with anywhere you get the QR code pulls up the receipt, identifies those are currently there. What happens if I put other products that I didn't pay for you?
Speaker 2
Yep, I didn't pay for that, right? What about other where there's occlusions,
Speaker 2
right? So that was paid for. The Orbit wasn't detected. It the serines weren't paid for. The mic. Gummies were right. So we can handle occlusions.
We can do robot.
So inventory.
Speaker 2
This is giant eagle. You know, we have Walmart catalogs. That's 90% of all products from any other Okay, these are the hard ones, right? When you go to condiments, look at the angles, look at the variations, and I'll even go to like some more here. Some of these. You'll see that there. Well, there. I didn't even, I didn't even sign this. The enrollment images, they're just downloaded. Yeah, look this. This house Italian looks different. The sauce color is different. We're still matching it, even though I didn't clear out this, and I'm not doing OCR at all. Your great thing is, I found this, you know, made jar of mayo, right? We found this. Make a jar here. So now we can tell associate, hey, you know, go, take this misplaced items. Go to so that's, that's that I want to show you the cool stuff, no augmented reality. I can put them. I have a simple camera on a radio glasses, and I can go and look around and actually do this is real time,
Speaker 2
running on a Raspberry Pi And a halo, interesting.
So we have many more you.
Speaker 2
So again, I can bring down the cost. I can't have everything running on a Raspberry Pi and a halo eight, and I would love to get on a Qualcomm. I can lower the cost down, or bring all this. So
Speaker 1
this is very interesting. Marja, so what's your go to market plan going ahead? Do you, if I'm understanding this correctly, you're working with Walmarts and HPs of the world today, and they're co designing the hardware with your software stack. How do you plan to scale this down the line in terms of customers, in terms of customers, also, what would be the business model? Would you just be a model provider? Would you be a platform? Would you tie up with a lot of different hardware form factors? How are you thinking about it. We
Speaker 2
will turn AI and everything. I don't care about the hybrid platform, right? The OEMs will dictate what they want me to be. You know, for Fujita can be just a nano or HP can be Halo. For you guys, I'll be wherever, whatever platform. You know, data logic is using you guys. I do their logic. Their logic is using you guys on their on cart. Right? Welcome Jeff. I want to port that there. I just had this schedule a long time with the CP. I told you the venture arm tomorrow, right? They have an 18 so we can be there's no short there's no one we haven't talked to that doesn't want. This problem is, I'm turning people away. I can't service I don't have enough customers or service things.
Speaker 1
That's my problem. Understood. That's a good problem to have, though. But I'd say my earlier in the slides, you had a slide on how you're pricing this. Can you explain that to me a little bit more? I could not get it from the table right away.
Speaker 2
So like the like, this one, yes, this was Walmart. MSA, yeah. Walmart is a Walmart's a one off. I'm not gonna charge the same thing. Like, when I go to volume, I made a big discount to Walmart just because they're my they're my springboard. The guys, Walmart shows us they did that. I'm giving them extra low price so it will scale for convenience stores. I'm not. I'm charging $1,000 per per camera per month. And when I do that, what you'll see is that convenience stores, the these OEMs, start overtaking Walmart,
Speaker 1
and you said $1,000 per camera per month. Yes, irrespective of the number of items you check out or it's not yours as much, okay, if
Speaker 2
I do that, I am making several 100 different million dollars a month a year just from that.
Speaker 1
Yeah, that's how a lot of these I fives and the mash guns and standard cognitions of the world do it. But, yeah,
Speaker 2
Speaker 1
Got it. And do you have a white paper for your 250,000 products in
Speaker 1
all these right? And do you have a white paper for for the software stack? You mean, like, just API wise or not? API wise, probably just a research paper or something that I can read up trying to understand the model right, to see how it compares with other players, things like
Speaker 2
that. That's our secret sauce. Yeah, makes sense. We have some very again, I have over 50 patents, close to 80. We probably find about 85 somewhere there. We have a good chunk of them already accepted, including some key blocking one. Yeah,
Speaker 1
yeah. The connection I'm trying to build Mario's here is the demo wise, it seems working really well against all the other demos I've seen for from similar players. I would possibly like to build a benchmarking table on how electron versus X, Y and Z across different parameters, and that's where I'm trying to get at so I was trying to see if there are variables or different spaces I can pull information from to build a table like that myself. You know, at the
end of the day, you have the pilot,
you have the testings for yourself, and
Speaker 2
that's what Walmart did, because no matter what I give you, it's gonna You won't believe it. And I don't want you to believe anything I give you. I want you to see for your own eyes. Don't believe anything I see. Talk to Walmart.
Don't take anything I've said I've liked everything I showed
Speaker 1
you. Got it, and between the current customers you have today, what's the expansion size for them and the pipe and the revenue that you're projecting for this year? How much of that would be from expansion? How much of that would be new customers?
Speaker 2
So this is what I'm expecting. You know, I we will be entering some pilots almost immediately, given that summer is going to be slow, right? Other retailers, I'm not expecting too much in 2025 there's only like two quarters left, yeah, but we're starting now in the summer, we'll maybe get so not much, but really ramping up in 2026 remember, we've not been that long. We've not been we've not been long that much. We've only had $2.2 million in actual raise, and we made 2.5 in actual revenue. Yeah. I mean, don't look at the absolute number. Look at our gradient. Look at how fast we're going give us gas money and will space excited here,
that's interesting. How big around are you planning to raise
7 million? I want 7
Speaker 1
million. If I can get more, I'll take more. Yeah. And in what stage are you in raising right now? Do you have a plan? Okay, so you still, because our process typically takes four to five weeks. Just wanted to know that we have a amount of time to dispose. Yeah, some some funds. More. Financial funds move faster. But just wanted to mention that that's that's interesting. Let me do a little bit more work on my end. Come back with a few follow up questions. And then I would like to involve one more member of my team who has, who has been in the camera business for Qualcomm for couple of decades. He's the best person to evaluate that. And then we can have a follow up conversation, including Tushar.
Speaker 2
And again, you should look at the IP portfolio. Really. All this is great, but once you see the strength of rocket portfolio, it's something that will compliment your other adventures as well. Yeah, I don't see myself as a threat. I see myself as a great compliment. And add on, if you want to dominate the market, Army might be in my team at your silver bullet, the binding of all CMU.
Speaker 1
That's that's the most interesting part to note, because, in that way, it does not seem a direct competition to ifI. That makes a lot of sense. Yep, yep, go ahead. Mark, right, yes. Can you
Speaker 2
hardware? I'm not setting hardware. Yep, makes sense. I i arm hardware.
Speaker 1
How accurate was this transcription?
