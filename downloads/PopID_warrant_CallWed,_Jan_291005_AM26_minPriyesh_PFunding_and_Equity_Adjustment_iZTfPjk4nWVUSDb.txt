S Speaker 15:18The terms of the warrant for Verifone will be the same. It's just that Verifone, because they're investing more money 4 million, they're making this huge you're making a really significant off balance sheet investment in the manufacturing of the retrofit modules and the embedded terminals. And they're actually the big thing for us. I think I mentioned this, is they've agreed to pay us a royalty on every hardware sale where they're just going to embed the biometrics. Which, which that to me, de risk the steel substantially, because even before biometric usage becomes common, they're gonna vet our technology so that it's available on every No,

S Speaker 211:43got it and so, and maybe Dave and David, you already spotted this. What is the final ownership of investors? Post the warrant coverage I see road for DD shows the initial Qualcomm ownership, which is prior to the warrant. Is there ownership percentage table than post warrant coverage?

S Speaker 312:31there's no there's no table, and they don't have it. May ask a question. Oh, no, go ahead. No no, please finish. David, go ahead, just before, just for television. You said, like the 38 million adjustment. It's not a 38 million adjustment, it's a floor, right? So it's basically a 70 million adjustment. Or did I get that wrong? That's
there's no there's no table, and they don't have it. May ask a question. Oh, no, go ahead. No no, please finish. David, go ahead, just before, just for television.

S Speaker 112:53right, it's the floor and the reality. So in order to get above the 38 million based on the formula, we have to do over 3.6 million of revenue, and there's just no way we can do that when with what we have to do under the JP Morgan license agreement, we did a million last year, calendar year, that, you know, if you look at the fiscal year, and there's just no way. So we're going to be under that 3.6 months, and it doesn't include hardware, so we can't. There's really no way that game. It's just, I mean, Sullivan and Cromwell, JP Morgan's Council negotiated all that. And it's just, it's just going to be what it is, which is we'll probably end up with maybe 2 billion in revenue for fiscal year, 2025 and Okay, so it'll be set at 38 million, which is the floor, and all those adjusted numbers are going to affect. It's pretty certain. Basically,
right, it's the floor and the reality. So in order to get above the 38 million based on the formula, we have to do over 3.6 million of revenue, and there's just no way we can do that when with what we have to do under the JP Morgan license agreement, we did a million last year, calendar year, that, you know, if you look at the fiscal year, and there's just no way.
