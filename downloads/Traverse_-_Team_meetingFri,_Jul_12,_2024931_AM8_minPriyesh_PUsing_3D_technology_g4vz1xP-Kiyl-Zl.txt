S Speaker 10:00Your Air Force airman, he is he has his platoon of Airmen that have to go and drive these vehicles operate these vehicles and he has to use responsible for their training and he only can get like maybe five of them qualified over a period of months because they don't have buses that they can go use the all the buses aren't used. They have a lack of equipment out there and everyone learns at a different pace. They do classroom training periodically but they have 1000 Other things that they can do that are that they have to be doing as well. And a lot of material is subpar. If you are right now the alternative is that you're dropping a 200 point inspection manual just on the desk or on the table of that 18 year old telling him to to be able to memorize all of it and perform that inspection. And so what we're doing is we're that dashboard that we have that I'll show here in a second is for the chance to build out this 3d application just by taking the RGB video and dropping in his documents. And in the very beginning, we'll have to be more hands on in the process. But the once he has that 3d application, he can send those links out to his students and you can then track their progress and you can actually quiz them on okay, are they performing up to speed? Are they doing things that they that they need to do? And I will actually jump ahead a little bit

S Speaker 11:54ever sat. So, actually funny enough. You mentioned that Dallas Fort Worth. So you can this is not just limited to equipment. You can do large areas seed reconstruction with this as well and we could actually show you some research that is people doing this with drones for kilometers and kilometers and kilometers of land, and you get the same high fidelity reconstructions. Again, like this is not robust enough to deliver to a customer yet but we firmly believe this is the future of not only reality capture, but also intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance ISR inside of the military. People have already asked for this from satellite imagery, and we do have some examples of that but it's not quite clear enough yet. We need more data. But for Dallas Fort Worth specifically.

S Speaker 12:43We when the infrastructure side identifies Correct, correct and more training to familiarize individuals with what's going on in this in this environment. So for instance, letting people get onboard into a mind site or a construction site if they've never seen the site before and they have to come on in a couple of days.

S Speaker 13:25Training is the initial beachhead for us by far and there's we've already identified we just got off a call yesterday that was tremendous. There's so much equipment that is getting transferred around in the military right now. And the one of the biggest problems is these vendors once they drop that equipment in whoever's hands, they had a really hard time actually getting that equipment up and running and it takes a long time. For instance, OSD, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, they there's $10 million contract is just sending these 3d printers that look like Conex boxes here to Ukraine. And once they get there, Ukrainians have no idea how to actually operate that and so they actually have to send instructor with those Conex boxes every single time to do that training. So what we want to do is just send that Conex box with a tablet that is traverse 3d Is that says, hey, this is the 3d model. And we can walk through how to set this up. And we have you have the ability to walk through all of the instruction manuals and everything in your own language, which is pretty trivial to do. With these language models. It's that type of training, those type of training opportunities that we're going after. There's another one that's very similar for hydrogen generators that we actually hope to have a demo of here by late August. And it's things like that, for the nav See, example. They have a cold spray trainer that they're trying to get 3d models up for training 500 Somebody first corrosive materials group has three painting bays that they need to they have a never ending stream of people that are coming through to them. They have to get spun up and trained on how to operate these systems. And they can't bring them into the actual Bay is because they're always in use. And so it's, if they think if you don't have the equipment, or if you're sending the equipment, you don't have the right people to do the training. That's where traverse wants to be at initially.

S Speaker 35:21Another thing that's interesting is the folks who were speaking with yesterday talked about how much of a need there is for reservists for this type of training. I mean, people who, you know, gets can only spend one weekend a month doing their reservist duty. They don't have a lot of time to do that training. And so when they come in and need to operate some sort of system or device or wherever it may be that they need something that they can quickly get spun up on, or even, you know, take home and study themselves. So that's absolutely what our software would enable them to do.

S Speaker 16:02Now, you probably just saw me kind of digging the document a little bit and then pull up this this poster, correct? Yeah, yeah. Okay. So this is actually some of the research that we've been doing and kind of the differentiating factor that we have the 3d reconstruction is awesome in that way better kind of writing, but we don't necessarily want to innovate. So we aren't 3d reconstruction. There's different techniques, techniques and tweaks that we can make to it. But what we're going for is this larger 3d scene understanding that we had mentioned before so there's different ways
