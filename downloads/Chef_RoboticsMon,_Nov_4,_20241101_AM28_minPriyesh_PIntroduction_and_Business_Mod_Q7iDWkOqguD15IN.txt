right, so let me pull up my screen. You
S Speaker 11:56you. I think you can see it now. Yep. So Richard, one thing I wanted to understand better was, how is the entire business model, structure, I believe you. How do you finance the robots? How they deployed? How do you collect revenues? The breakdown of that?

S Speaker 22:16Yeah, all good questions. So the way the business model works is it's $10,000 up front per robot, and that's just to take care of the actual deployment itself, right? That's the counter engineering to take care of deployment. Then on top of that, there is the recurring fee. And the recurring fee is, of course, our main business model, and that's that 57k per robot per year number, right? So, so basically, like, the way the business model works is, like a 10k is just to take care of the deployment and travel and the physical deployment, and then the recurring is really where we make money. Yeah, our goal for the for the up front is really not to lose money. It's not necessary to make a lot of money, but just be, you know, profitable on that, and then really, like, we make money on the RAS robotic systems.

S Speaker 13:00Got it. And how do you finance the robot? What's, what is the kind of CapEx spend you go in with things like that? Two

S Speaker 23:08questions. So basically, as of today, our Bill of Material put on 30, 54k, so there's a few thoughts here, and you can kind of see this in the cash flow capital efficiency section. So you know, what we try to do is have our customers pay us upfront annually. So if they pay us annually, then this problem solved, right? Because we get all the money up front, right? Yeah. Sometimes it's not annually, it's quarterly. Also fine. Obviously there are cases where some customers are like, No, we really want monthly. And so if it's monthly, the way this works is that we we work with a banking partner. The mechanics are a little bit different today than they would be after the raise. By the way, we can talk about both mechanics today are as soon as we sign a customer, we actually do buy the hardware, and then we deploy it, and then as soon as we meet a site acceptance test, that's kind of what revenues recognize. The cut the bank would advance full build materials. So we float the bill of materials, but do it say two or three months? That is today. Now we've already received term sheets for a, you know, after this round proposal. And that the way that would work is we get that shows upon signature contract itself. And so that basically allows us to be like, kind of cash flow positive as soon as we kind of order hardware. Basically,

S Speaker 24:38even with this current approach, you can see that like we are actually net cash flow positive within five months of deploying a robot that's today already.

S Speaker 14:46Yeah, you mentioned here that your net cash flow positive in five months and without financing, that would be seven months. If I'm not wrong, I guess I read that. How is that difference? Nine? Yeah, I see nine months, yeah. How's
Yeah, you mentioned here that your net cash flow positive in five months and without financing, that would be seven months. If I'm not wrong, I guess I read that. How is that difference? Nine? Yeah, I see nine months, yeah. How's

S Speaker 25:01the very simple, very simple calculation, basically, like, and, you know, I think, I think I called out here. We had the

S Speaker 25:17Materials divided by the annual revenue. Okay? And that what these, these unit economics, are actually not our unit economics today. By the way. They're actually like worst case unit economics. Yeah, today are sheets better? I think you probably read the notebook factor. Hello, fresh. Yeah, a lot of business travel. So they turned actually recently, yeah, we could talk with the story there, by the way. But actually, as of today, we do actually have 75% growth margin. So this 68 number, 68.4 is actually 75 and our ASP is actually more like 70k

5:50So our ASP is actually better today. And, you know,
So our ASP is actually better today. And, you know,
So our ASP is actually better today. And, you know,
So our ASP is actually better today. And, you know,
S Speaker 25:54this is where we, you know, I kind of reduced it just to be like, This is what is going to be the future. To be in the future, basically.
this is where we, you know, I kind of reduced it just to be like, This is what is going to be the future. To be in the future, basically.

S Speaker 26:12Hello Fresh. This only happened, by the way, a week and a half ago. Okay? They were paying a lot. They were paying 118k so that is honestly unrealistic. We got a very good deal. It was unrealistic, but that was kind of driving up our ASP.

S Speaker 26:44So one thing that's very nice about chef, and you can kind of see this on the product slide, but every customer gets the exact same hardware, no differences. And basically the hardware is very simple. It's a robot arm with a camera, you know, tub of food, some utensils. It's very simple hardware, right? And it's the same footprint as a person, which means that you can slide onto any existing line, no retrofitting necessary, right? So what that means is, basically, the plumber is quite simple, which is, you take a robot off the line, sorry, you take a human off the line, you slide the robot on. It's it's no retrofitting, and then, basically the only inputs we need from the customer is a compressed airline and a power line. That's it. Every factory has that, by the way, and you're ready to run. So deployment is probably like, you know, it's about two months. I would say, yeah, right. And when do you realize

S Speaker 17:36your revenues? I think you think you briefly mentioned it. But is it after deployment? Is it when the contract is
your revenues? I think you think you briefly mentioned it. But is it after deployment? Is it when the contract is
your revenues? I think you think you briefly mentioned it. But is it after deployment? Is it when the contract is
your revenues? I think you think you briefly mentioned it. But is it after deployment? Is it when the contract is
S Speaker 27:44signed? So the way this works is, we sign the contract well, so there, yeah. So the mechanics are basically like, we sign a contract and then we will actually order the hardware. Or if we have inventory, you don't need to order it, but we get the hardware, we deploy it, and then once we actually deploy it, we do what's called a site acceptance test, which is basically like a one week kind of test at their site to really prove to them that the thing works. Once you prove to them that the whole thing works, the revenue recognizer they pay
signed? So the way this works is, we sign the contract well, so there, yeah. So the mechanics are basically like, we sign a contract and then we will actually order the hardware.

S Speaker 18:13us got it, and what are the metrics behind it. I'm just curious, how do you prove that the thing works? Is there any accuracy figure that you're targeting?
us got it, and what are the metrics behind it. I'm just curious, how do you prove that the thing works? Is there any accuracy figure that you're targeting?

us got it, and what are the metrics behind it. I'm just curious, how do you prove that the thing works? Is there any accuracy figure that you're targeting?
S Speaker 28:21Yeah, exactly. So basically, there's like, a few different kind of metrics that we predefined in the MSA. So these are predefined. So it'd be things like throughput, it'll be things like footprint, it'll be things like the consistency we basically pre negotiate these in the actual MSA, so we know what success looks like, and we just have improved success. And so we'll take on the technical risk, but we're okay with taking on the technical risk because we know it's something that we can do
Yeah, exactly. So basically, there's like, a few different kind of metrics that we predefined in the MSA. So these are predefined. So it'd be things like throughput, it'll be things like footprint, it'll be things like the consistency we basically pre negotiate these in the actual MSA, so we know what success looks like, and we just have improved success.

And so we'll take on the technical risk, but we're okay with taking on the technical risk because we know it's something that we can do
S Speaker 18:53that's very interesting approach. Just out of curiosity again, do you consciously try to negotiate these metrics and have that in the contract, or is it coming from the customers?
that's very interesting approach. Just out of curiosity again, do you consciously try to negotiate these metrics and have that in the contract, or is it coming from the customers?
that's very interesting approach. Just out of curiosity again, do you consciously try to negotiate these metrics and have that in the contract, or is it coming from the customers?
that's very interesting approach. Just out of curiosity again, do you consciously try to negotiate these metrics and have that in the contract, or is it coming from the customers?
S Speaker 29:08We try to negotiate these metrics up front? Because I think, like I think learning is that you don't want a moving goal post, right? Everyone's gonna have metrics anyways, so you might as well just admit it, and just like, negotiate it, versus kind of like not having anything in that single figure we used to do, think of, oh, we'll figure it out, but then the goal post is always moving. And I think, like, our learning has been just like, This is what we need to hit, and then we hit it. Yeah, no negotiation. It just, this is what. It's black and white, totally. That
We try to negotiate these metrics up front? Because I think, like I think learning is that you don't want a moving goal post, right?

S Speaker 19:37makes sense. Let me jump over to the pipeline. I think that's one important part that we plan to uncover down the line in our diligence. So here, Rajat, I think you mentioned that the current customers can be expanded to reach a significant amount of error, what I can see is that a lot of expansion potential is probably just with the Taylor farms account. Is that a concern? How are you thinking about it? And I also saw, like I briefly went through the model, and I saw that Taylor has a one year contract. So can you shed some light over it? Maybe give me a bit context. So
makes sense. Let me jump over to the pipeline. I think that's one important part that we plan to uncover down the line in our diligence.

Is that a concern? How are you thinking about it? And I also saw, like I briefly went through the model, and I saw that Taylor has a one year contract. So can you shed some light over it? Maybe give me a bit context. So

Maybe give me a bit context. So
S Speaker 210:21I think there's some context here, which is, like, you know, there's, there's like, whale customers, and then there's like, everybody else, right? Yeah, Taylor, premise is definitely a whale customer, but that's just our first whale customer. You know, it's not like we're, these are current customers. But of course, one of the big things we want to do with this round is, like, really scale up the sales and marketing team. Like, really, really scale that up. So, you know, I think we expect and are going to work hard towards having substantially more customers. So there isn't that kind of risk in terms of just, you know, focusing on one customer. Now at the same time, what I would say is, like, you know, the nice thing about a customer like Taylor firms is their ten billion revenue business. They're not one of these, like, it's not a startup. They've been around for 14 years. They're very stable business plans all over North America. So we actually don't think it's their big customers. Their customers are Starbucks and Costco, Whole Foods and Walmart, big customers. So I think it's a good, stable business. So we feel pretty good about, like, you know, scaling within them. I think it's actually an asset, which is, once you get in, you can scale within them quite easily. But again, I think the way you can think about it is, like, the business model of shaft is basically this idea. There's, like, two thoughts, right? One is, of course, which, of course. But also it's this idea we can scale within our customers. And of course, that's a exciting opportunity, just given that they're fairly big customers,
I think there's some context here, which is, like, you know, there's, there's like, whale customers, and then there's like, everybody else, right?

S Speaker 211:52factor has been having we started working with them in about late 2023 and the robots actually were performing very well. So if you were talking to anybody there, they would tell automation leads that the robots performed extremely well. What happened is that their business was suffering pretty immensely. They had a 50% drop, stock drop, plus they fired every single person at a factor like every single person we knew was gone. There was a hiring freeze. They knew expenditure fees. They did three rounds of layoffs. I mean, it was kind of a bloodbath, right? And they were trying to figure out any way they can kind of stop, just narrow the focus, just make the current thing work. Like, don't try to do too much, just narrative, make the current thing work. So we had a good call with our head of, new head of automation, because, of course, the previous one was fired, and like, what's going on here? And he made it abundantly clear that this has nothing to do with the performance of the robots. It's

S Speaker 213:13there's a slide. I think maybe it's the one before or after. Yeah, this is a good kind of slide with some of the metrics. You can kind of see the error rate there, right? We have very good uptime. We're very good hardware. Mean, couple of failure. And then you can also see some of the consistency data, which is some of the main data. Consistency is one of the biggest metrics, right? If you're like, are you consistent? Can you place? Well, basically, got

I don't right now, but I can have something got it. And
S Speaker 113:51one more thing I wanted to understand better was the pipeline. How do you basically, what's your definition behind the prospect, qualified in review, sort of customers. And, in fact, maybe we can double click on this, understand the entire sales pipeline, on how the timing between your first reach out to closing. How has that been on an average? Who do you sell to? Those kind of things? Let me

S Speaker 214:16just take some notes. So so I will there is a more in depth pipeline which has those definitions. I can add that in as well. Oh

S Speaker 215:15So basically, you know, there's a few thoughts here. One is that we're solving a really important problem. The customer is labor short. They can't make enough our customers are usually familiar with automation. It's traditional automation. We're familiar with it because it's partial line. What this essentially means is you're not fully automating a process. You a process. It's not like if the line goes down, they're not doing production right tarp line, which means if chef goes down, that's fine. You the slower risk. There's not a big capex up front, makes it easy to get approved. And then we're only asking for four to six robots. It's not like millions of dollars. It's you dollars. It's, you know, it's a it's a few 100k that you're going to pay, and that will be less than the cost of your people. That's usually why we find that sales cycles are relatively

S Speaker 116:13Yeah, that's interesting. The sales cycles actually not. Don't look bad at all. Who do you sell to within these companies? And is it more top down? Is it more bottoms up? How have you Where have you seen success?
Yeah, that's interesting. The sales cycles actually not. Don't look bad at all. Who do you sell to within these companies? And is it more top down? Is it more bottoms up? How have you Where have you seen success?

S Speaker 216:25Yeah, good questions. It's usually top down. You know, we will usually go to the corporate level. And why is that, by the way, because again, our sales strategy, or part of our skill strategy is customer success rate driven. So the idea would be like, we get a director or VP on board. They'll start on one plan, of course, but once they're happy with one plan, that they'll expand laterally to board funds. That way, that is the approach, right? And we'll build that actually into the contract. We'll build an order form to an expansion into the contract. Okay, so now, with that being said, Who do we sell to? It's usually, like I said, it's director above, you know, we talk to directors, we talk to VPS, we talk to SAPs, we talk to C suites, founders, whatever it might be. And then, you know, the functional groups might be anything from operations, manufacturing, production, engineering, automation, it depends on the company, but these are some of the groups we sell to. Got it. Got it.

S Speaker 217:56Yeah. So I think, as a general note, we're in the manufacturing space. We're not in restaurants, as you know, I think so within manufacturing, there's honestly, really not very many competitors, I would say, right, there is traditional automation, which, as you know, is not very flexible. So that's not really competitor, but it exists. It's worth calling out. There's people and people, honestly, other real competitors. People are quite good. They're flexible. Obviously they don't want to do the work, that's the issue. But, you know, upset with that, they're actually quite good outside. Now, there is this kind of called occipital AI, which used to be called Software. They were not, they're not a competitor, but they, they're even less of a competitor. Now, I would say
Yeah. So I think, as a general note, we're in the manufacturing space. We're not in restaurants, as you know, I think so within manufacturing, there's honestly, really not very many competitors, I would say, right, there is traditional automation, which, as you know, is not very flexible.

18:40they, they basically
S Speaker 218:44make inspection software. So they'll kind of tell you, hey, this part is not good quality or things like that, so not even better. But I think it's, you know, some people know about software, so that's kind of exciting. There's not, honestly, no, there's no direct competitors in that space. Really is people, right? And in restaurants, I think I'll go through each of these categories for you, but as a high level, I think the restaurant space itself is quite hard, and here's the reason it's hard. In a restaurant, you're only doing any particular task for a few hours, so let's say you're at sweet green. I just made that out made that up. You're only assembling the meals for lunch rush and dinner rush. That's four hours. So you have to generate an entire ROI robot in two to four hours. That's the crux of the issue. To really generate a full few months worth of ROI, which is to say eight hours a day, five days a week. Yeah, you have to do a lot of tasks, which, of course, today's technology is not good at. Does that make sense?
make inspection software. So they'll kind of tell you, hey, this part is not good quality or things like that, so not even better. But I think it's, you know, some people know about software, so that's kind of exciting. There's not, honestly, no, there's no direct competitors in that space. Really is people, right? And in restaurants, I think I'll go through each of these categories for you, but as a high level, I think the restaurant space itself is quite hard, and here's the reason it's hard.

S Speaker 119:42I get that Yes, totally. Utilization is a factor here. Yeah, yes,

I get that Yes, totally. Utilization is a factor here. Yeah, yes,
S Speaker 219:46that's the overall issue. Now we can talk about each of these individual cases. So the overall Jimmy is, I think, the real reason, but there's other reasons too. So there's a bunch of people who actually make their own restaurant. Let's make our own restaurant that I think is very tough, because you're essentially in the restaurant business because, no, it's a very tough business. So, yeah, I think that's just the wrong business model. There's quite a few different companies that are testament to that. Maybe right? There's a lot of companies that focus on Cooking. Cooking seems like it's actually labor intensive, but the thing with cooking is one person can cook for 100 people using big pots and pans more. Does that make sense? Yeah. So cooking is actually not very labor intensive. 60 to 70% of labor in commercial kitchens is an assembly. So what I mean to say is these guys are focused on the wrong problem. If you look at miso and Chef Jasper and good bites, they're just focused on the wrong problem. It's engineers who are trying to build who are trying to build something over us as really solving a problem.

S Speaker 120:41That's interesting. One, one follow up question on this bucket, do you see some of these companies, if they succeed at coping cooking? Do you see them moving downstream into assembly?
That's interesting. One, one follow up question on this bucket, do you see some of these companies, if they succeed at coping cooking? Do you see them moving downstream into assembly?

S Speaker 221:07I think there's two things. First of all, the first assumption there is, if they succeed in cooking, I don't think anyone's going to succeed in cooking anytime soon. It's just like the sensors don't exist. The vision is not good enough, because most of cooking is not vision. It's like this, the smell, it's the hearing. These sensors don't exist. Yeah, I don't think it's gonna be done in MC but let's say I'm wrong. Let's say they've figured out, right? Are the data models similar? Not really, because, again, cooking is like, okay, like, how well done is this food? But assembly is like, you crush the material. Do you spill the material? Do you any place in a particular compartment into a small, little insert? It's quite it's a it's a different task. Does that make sense? Cooking is more of a manipulation task. Like, how do you not crush something? How do you not how do you spread it? How do you spread cheese over trade? It's very different than like, you know, what temperature should I optimally control the stove out to get the right sear?

S Speaker 122:08Got it and I would say a more layman question here. But do you see the constraints on being a successful cooking robotics company. The constraint there is it on the hardware end or on the software end, according to you for cooking? Yeah,

S Speaker 222:26I don't know a ton about cooking, yeah, because, I mean, what I would say honestly is like, I'm very customer focused on our customers, that cooking is not a problem, so I did not begin to cook Fair enough. I wouldn't give you have a good answer for you. I do think it's, it's obviously, obviously, it's both. And I think we know that. I would say that like it's always software, except in these cases where there's not enough hardware to get the data. And I think in cooking, there's not enough sensors right now, got you to boil it down? I'd probably bring it to hardware.

22:55Interesting. Interesting. Yeah,

Interesting. Interesting. Yeah,
S Speaker 122:59would love to sort of get your thoughts on the foundational model aspect of it. I personally within the team look at AI investments. So this is particularly very exciting to me. How are you thinking about it? Would love to get your thoughts. Yeah, that's a

S Speaker 223:12good question. So, you know, I think Chef, so I think you perhaps the way, here's how we think about it, the way that robots, robots used to be made and are still made, I would say in production at least, is its heuristics driven. So what I mean by heuristic is like heuristic for self driving car might be, you detect the red light, your perception system detects a red light, and then your planning system stops the car, right? That is heuristics. It is still machine learning. It is just it's heuristics, right? That is how chef today mostly works. The robots we have in production are like, let us detect the density of this food, let us detect the topography, let us dynamically figure out where to pick and there's a perception stack, there's a planning stack, there's a control stack, and they'll work together to make something happen, right? Does that make sense? Yeah, that approach allowed us to ship lots of robots and make 30 million meals, so we have a treasure trove of data on how to manipulate food now, right? So that is the approach we use to get here. Now, what we're doing is saying, Okay, well, let's leverage that data, that production data, right? The inputs and outputs, basically inputs being images and the outputs being robot joint data, yeah. And let's learn the model using generative AI, right? So specifically, so that's the end goal. Now the way what we're doing today is basically this, and you can kind of see it in this, in this kind of like little model down here, we take production data, we combine that with human demonstrations and the human demonstrations, you can watch that video your time, but basically the idea here is that human demonstrations are very good to teach it new tasks. For us, a new task might be a new class. What I mean by class is like going from not doing green beans to doing green beans. It's a new kind of material that we could not like. Going from black beans to kidney beans is easy and not easy, but our current approach to do it, yeah, where imitation learning and generative AI is useful is brand new classic. So what we do then is we can combine the production data of existing units with the human demonstration to really have a system that that includes a robot. So does that kind of make sense? And then what's nice about this approach is that we can ship robots today. We don't need some brand new technology breakthrough to make this work within a region should rob us today, and then this new approach allows the using diffusion policies, it allows us to get better and better and more optimal, and new ingredients and new classes and things
