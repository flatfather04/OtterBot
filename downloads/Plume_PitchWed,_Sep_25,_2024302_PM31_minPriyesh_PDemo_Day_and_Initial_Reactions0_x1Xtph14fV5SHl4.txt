S Speaker 20:21very happy to done it, and onto the next,
S Speaker 10:26Yeah, I just wish they gave you more than a minute to talk about it. The pitches were so short, I wanted to hear so much more. But glad we're talking now. So a lot of questions that I have from there. Would love to take it on from there. But for context, Edward, I guess what I can do to start with I can give you a brief background about myself, how we Qualcomm ventures as a fund operate. What are we looking at? And then we'll pass it over to you for discussing plume in your own words. I believe, very briefly, I am priyesh. I work here as a senior associate. I focus on AI investments and investments in clean tech. So and my background has been in cleantech. I was in India. I've led a lot of B to B renewable energy projects back there, I've also worked with a lot of early stage startups. So I have an entrepreneurial experience. Moved to the US about two and a half years back, and I'm I've worked with Menlo Ventures, Morpheus ventures, more recently, starting this year, I joined Qualcomm ventures team. So that's, that's where I am coming from. And I guess the fund itself has been around for more than 25 years. We have had 250 we currently have 250 plus active portfolio companies, and it's a global fund. So we have offices in London, uh, Israel, US, China, India and Latin America, and just in us, we, we expect to make about 150 $280 million investment a year. So the team is actively deploying our focus areas are in AI, electrification is something we recently started. I'll tell you more about it. But AI, IoT, industrial automation, camera, computer vision, companies, things like that. And our check sizes are two to ten million and more like specifically which things which intersect with bloom, is that we recently realized that there is a lot of opportunity in electrification that Qualcomm can be a very big player in, and we have a few investments in that space. Span. IO is a span is a company in home electrification that you may know of. So our Managing Director sits on the board there, and we are very structurally looking at electrification. We plan to make a few investments in this space. And that's where, when I came across bloom, I was very excited to know more about it.

S Speaker 22:54Very cool. Very cool. Okay, that's a great discussion. And yes, fan is a great company, at least from the outside. I don't know exactly how it works from the inside, but on the outside, it looks great.
Very cool. Very cool. Okay, that's a great discussion. And yes, fan is a great company, at least from the outside. I don't know exactly how it works from the inside, but on the outside, it looks great.

3:06I'm curious. I have two questions for you, yeah.
S Speaker 23:08The first one is, what were the What were you doing exactly in renewables in India? I'm curious. Yeah. And second is, do Qualcomm invest into YC companies. Is it something you guys do, or is it for mostly
The first one is, what were the What were you doing exactly in renewables in India? I'm curious. Yeah. And second is, do Qualcomm invest into YC companies. Is it something you guys do, or is it for mostly

S Speaker 13:26So, yes, absolutely. In India, I was working for a clean tech company. It's called CleanMax, which sets up renewable energy plants across solar, wind, carbon credit and storage technologies, and we will then sell, we used to sell power to a lot of corporates like Facebook, Amazon, in a power purchase agreement side of the Yeah. So I was in business development. Initially, I led some of the projects. I led Facebook's first deal in Asia, Pacific region. I led a few group captive projects for Amazon, and then moved on in their corporate development vertical, led a few of their internal processes, and then moved to the US for my MBA. So that's where I'm coming from, but have a good understanding of this market. It's also something which gets me very excited, because it makes a difference, right? So I do a lot of AI investments, and that is where my primary focus is. But I'd really like to make a few clean tech investments and be also involved in this side of the world. Okay, that makes sense. And about your second question, we usually are a Series A investor. We have now started making more seed investments, given that the valuations are all completely jumbled up, and seed investments usually look like series A so we have started making seed as well. We as a strategy. It's not like we take a look at the entire YC batch, and we make sure that we invest in a few of them. So our strategy is more opportunistic. In that sense, it does happen that a lot of good companies come out of YC, and we look at that, and we have made investments in YC companies, but I would say in terms of check sizes and minimums, check sizes somewhere around $2 million so that's where, like, kind of very early companies do not fit for us.

S Speaker 25:15Okay, that makes sense. That's good. Okay, yep, interesting. I yeah, let's, let's, let's think right into it. Now, absolutely, how do you want to do this? So either we can do the very typical I present myself, I present the company, or maybe you have specific questions from the pitch, then we can just
Okay, that makes sense. That's good. Okay, yep, interesting. I yeah, let's, let's, let's think right into it. Now, absolutely, how do you want to do this?

So either we can do the very typical I present myself, I present the company, or maybe you have specific questions from the pitch, then we can just
S Speaker 15:37sure I would love to know a little bit more about yourself and your background, and then on the company, I do have a fair bit of understanding of what you plan to do. I was just going to the website. I should have created an account myself and maybe just done the home assessment for my place. I could not do that, but I'd love to understand your tech stack as well. I what I saw that there are numerous multimodal kind of data points that you use, and how are you going about that? And then later on, we can talk a little bit more about the GTM part of it. Okay, sounds great.
sure I would love to know a little bit more about yourself and your background, and then on the company, I do have a fair bit of understanding of what you plan to do. I was just going to the website.

S Speaker 19:05and here I am. Now, absolutely, that sounds very exciting. It seems like you've had a lot of adventures already,
and here I am. Now, absolutely, that sounds very exciting. It seems like you've had a lot of adventures already,
and here I am. Now, absolutely, that sounds very exciting. It seems like you've had a lot of adventures already,
and here I am. Now, absolutely, that sounds very exciting. It seems like you've had a lot of adventures already,
S Speaker 29:12yeah. And then, exactly, and then even just to find Palantir, I did before, a lot of different internships in order to find my way. Went through Uber VC, actually a little bit of VC, yeah, consulting, fine. And finally, which I think was a perfect fit for the last two years. Wow,
yeah. And then, exactly, and then even just to find Palantir, I did before, a lot of different internships in order to find my way. Went through Uber VC, actually a little bit of VC, yeah, consulting, fine. And finally, which I think was a perfect fit for the last two years. Wow,

S Speaker 19:31sounds great. And how did you then come across home energy efficiency? How did that spark come in you?
sounds great. And how did you then come across home energy efficiency? How did that spark come in you?
sounds great. And how did you then come across home energy efficiency? How did that spark come in you?
sounds great. And how did you then come across home energy efficiency? How did that spark come in you?
S Speaker 111:30That makes a lot of sense, Edward, and I think
S Speaker 111:38So do you plan to sell to individuals, and are you seeing it as a data tech, first company, and then a services layer on top of it is that the plan?
So do you plan to sell to individuals, and are you seeing it as a data tech, first company, and then a services layer on top of it is that the plan?

S Speaker 211:50That's very good question. That's the kind of two questions we've been working on the last few months. On the first one, we realized that there was an actual need of trust from the consumer in order to trust some any software or any information that was given. And the trust was already given to people that were professional in this space, like real estate agents, like energy auditors, like construction companies. And so those three groups, three buckets of people, had no tools today to do home energy assessments and to advise on renovations. And so those are the people we're targeting. We're giving tools. We're giving that co pilot in order for them to advise the end consumer. And that's how we believe it's going to be the most impactful, generate them as revenue, so we are actually happy to be distributing that information back to the consumer at the very end.

S Speaker 112:47Yeah, that makes a lot of sense, and that that could actually also unlock a lot of scale for you. Otherwise, just going individual would have been difficult, for sure. Have you come across this company called Block power? I recently came across them, and they seem to have a similar model. Of course, they do not have the data layer like you mentioned. They do assess home energy a little bit, and they particularly focus on HVAC, but they have gone really big in this segment, so that was really exciting for me to just understand the market a little bit. Oh, very cool. Yeah, it never came in my radar as well. I recently just stumbled across them, and it seems like they've raised two $50 million so should they should be doing? Well, yeah, okay, pretty cool. Well, that's that's exciting. Edward, so what's the target market. Do you plan to be Europe first? Are you thinking about it geographically in some sense?
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense, and that that could actually also unlock a lot of scale for you. Otherwise, just going individual would have been difficult, for sure.

S Speaker 213:46Yeah. So we have, we don't really want to move back to Europe, but at the same time, this is where the biggest pressure in terms of regulation is. It's in Europe. So because we're a software play, we can go and capture Europe at the same time, focusing maybe first on France, because that's where the biggest pressure is. Second is Germany. Then we have Spain in the UK, yeah. And so we are, at least for the next few months, going to focus on the on the on the European market. Now we also know that the US market is coming, so that he does block power as an example. But also Canada is very interesting, and because, once again, that we're that softer play, we're able to move pretty quickly between geographies and are not too stuck with like for installation, operational work. So yeah, to answer quickly, Europe first, and then we'll see for the US and Canada,
Yeah. So we have, we don't really want to move back to Europe, but at the same time, this is where the biggest pressure in terms of regulation is. It's in Europe. So because we're a software play, we can go and capture Europe at the same time, focusing maybe first on France, because that's where the biggest pressure is. Second is Germany. Then we have Spain in the UK, yeah. And so we are, at least for the next few months, going to focus on the on the on the European market. Now we also know that the US market is coming, so that he does block power as an example.

that's a US entity today, and there's going to be a European subsidy,
that's a US entity today, and there's going to be a European subsidy,
S Speaker 115:01Got it, what kind of account sizes are you expecting, and what kind of business model would you have when you're supplying these software tools to some of these real estate guys?
Got it, what kind of account sizes are you expecting, and what kind of business model would you have when you're supplying these software tools to some of these real estate guys?

Got it, what kind of account sizes are you expecting, and what kind of business model would you have when you're supplying these software tools to some of these real estate guys?
S Speaker 215:10Yeah, so we are right now. We having our first contract is $6,000 a year, and we're looking at other contracts in our pipeline that will be closer to 15 to 20, 20,000 a year, and some of the bigger could be even closer to to, like a few, almost a million, depending on how big they are the companies. But today, we're targeting midsize, some company that's good to my team and
Yeah, so we are right now. We having our first contract is $6,000 a year, and we're looking at other contracts in our pipeline that will be closer to 15 to 20, 20,000 a year, and some of the bigger could be even closer to to, like a few, almost a million, depending on how big they are the companies.

But today, we're targeting midsize, some company that's good to my team and
S Speaker 115:43so far, like in your attempts to sell to these people, how has the sales cycle built? Do you think it's a longer sales cycle? How has that process been so far? Yeah,
so far, like in your attempts to sell to these people, how has the sales cycle built? Do you think it's a longer sales cycle? How has that process been so far? Yeah,
so far, like in your attempts to sell to these people, how has the sales cycle built? Do you think it's a longer sales cycle? How has that process been so far? Yeah,
so far, like in your attempts to sell to these people, how has the sales cycle built? Do you think it's a longer sales cycle? How has that process been so far? Yeah,
S Speaker 215:55it's actually pretty, pretty fast. Because they're mid size companies. We're targeting the small executive team, they see the value very quickly. Most of them have been looking for a product like this for a while. Have been trying to do it internally on like for Excel sheets or for software development. So those contracts with, like the 20k ACV, they're pretty fast to develop then the bigger ones, but like the equivalent of Home Depot, for example, that could be, it could be a potential distributor of our product that would take longer, but otherwise it's pretty fast, looking like the shortest we had was a week. The longest we had was like a month.

S Speaker 116:35Got it, got it. And these people that you sell to the real estate guys and the energy efficiency managers, if like, pardon my lack of understanding to use the better words and terminology, but the YC website mentioned that you call them as your partner. So what kind of service agreement do you have with them?
Got it, got it. And these people that you sell to the real estate guys and the energy efficiency managers, if like, pardon my lack of understanding to use the better words and terminology, but the YC website mentioned that you call them as your partner.

So what kind of service agreement do you have with them?
S Speaker 216:59Yeah, so we're selling the software to them, and they're using them to advise their clients. Now, one thing we're exploring right now, or we'll explore the future, is the fact that once we're selling and they're using the software to power 50% of home energy renovation in Europe, then we have this ecosystem of different players that are all in the same platform. And so already today, we're seeing some potential synergies, where real estate agent use it to advise their client, and then you have contracting companies asking us, okay, you have people from the real estate parts that want to do renovation, sell us the leads, and we'll do the renovation for them. And then have the opposite with renovation companies that know that this fight is going to be sold, so same that's going to be able to sell the leads to agents. So there is this, this ecosystem, and there's those synergies that are being created, yeah, and that's like an enormous amount of money, because in real estate, that's where the money is, within this transaction and commissions. So today we're B to B SAS, and we think we can grow our revenue pretty quickly with that hitting like in the in the 10s of millions of dollars in the next few years. But then in the long run, there's also this value to be captured? Oh,
Yeah, so we're selling the software to them, and they're using them to advise their clients.

But then in the long run, there's also this value to be captured? Oh,
S Speaker 118:22absolutely, yeah, this market is just growing, and there would be need for a very specialized marketplace. And you guys are very well positioned to be just at the center of it. That makes a lot of sense.
absolutely, yeah, this market is just growing, and there would be need for a very specialized marketplace. And you guys are very well positioned to be just at the center of it. That makes a lot of sense.

absolutely, yeah, this market is just growing, and there would be need for a very specialized marketplace. And you guys are very well positioned to be just at the center of it. That makes a lot of sense.
S Speaker 218:32And there is no software today, like, there is very old software to do those energy assessments. There's no like, I mean, smaller projects are starting, like we see the 345, startups that are, like, less than six months old, that are starting in Europe to do that, but, yeah, there's a huge market to go capture.
And there is no software today, like, there is very old software to do those energy assessments. There's no like, I mean, smaller projects are starting, like we see the 345, startups that are, like, less than six months old, that are starting in Europe to do that, but, yeah, there's a huge market to go capture.

S Speaker 118:52Absolutely, absolutely, I agree to that. So talking about that, would love to understand how you're thinking about the software. Where is the differentiation and what kind of data sources are you ingesting? How's the model looking like? Yeah.
Absolutely, absolutely, I agree to that. So talking about that, would love to understand how you're thinking about the software. Where is the differentiation and what kind of data sources are you ingesting? How's the model looking like? Yeah.
Absolutely, absolutely, I agree to that. So talking about that, would love to understand how you're thinking about the software. Where is the differentiation and what kind of data sources are you ingesting? How's the model looking like? Yeah.
Absolutely, absolutely, I agree to that. So talking about that, would love to understand how you're thinking about the software. Where is the differentiation and what kind of data sources are you ingesting? How's the model looking like? Yeah.
S Speaker 219:08So the software is interesting because there is kind of two two version, or like two bounds. There's a very low touch approach and there's very high touch approach. The low touch is for people like real estate agents that don't have a degree, don't know what energy efficiency is, and they just want to get a first ID. And that's what we're offering today, is that from a simple address, you can put the address on plume, and then we go fetch a lot of different information and give you a first estimates of the energy efficiency and the first estimates of the renovation. And then there is the high touch approach, where you have really professional like energy auditors that want to, want to have a simple life at the beginning, but also want to tweak all those parameters and add information in. And that's also, that's what we're the part we're building today is, for example, they have documents like PDF or floor plans. They want to add that as an information to the model. They want to add even old receipts from past renovation to know exactly the thickness of the installation that was added a few years ago, adding this, etc, etc, and making it high touch. So that's kind of the product. And to get that low touch part, we're using open source data that we that we have around registry of building, was the age of the building, what's the last energy assessment that was done? Things like that. And then satellite information to have type of materials at the structure of the roof, the distribution of the houses at multiple buildings are just one. We can sometimes also get the surface of the windows depending on the angle of the camera, and getting a lot of different endpoints on those houses.
So the software is interesting because there is kind of two two version, or like two bounds. There's a very low touch approach and there's very high touch approach.

S Speaker 120:53interesting. I'd love to go try the product myself. Do you happen to have any sort of demo video around it that, yes,
interesting. I'd love to go try the product myself. Do you happen to have any sort of demo video around it that, yes,
interesting. I'd love to go try the product myself. Do you happen to have any sort of demo video around it that, yes,
interesting. I'd love to go try the product myself. Do you happen to have any sort of demo video around it that, yes,
S Speaker 221:11It's the, it's the low touch version that I think I have a video I recorded it.
It's the, it's the low touch version that I think I have a video I recorded it.
It's the, it's the low touch version that I think I have a video I recorded it.
It's the, it's the low touch version that I think I have a video I recorded it.
21:23I think it makes sense when you see the video,
21:49Well, maybe there is a play to actually have some kind of
Well, maybe there is a play to actually have some kind of
Well, maybe there is a play to actually have some kind of
Well, maybe there is a play to actually have some kind of
S Speaker 123:12right? And these are all public data sources for now. Mostly
right? And these are all public data sources for now. Mostly
right? And these are all public data sources for now. Mostly
right? And these are all public data sources for now. Mostly
S Speaker 223:36and yeah. So you get, you get your grade, which is the grading system used in most European country. And then you get the difference, different renovation you could be doing, what going to be the impact. And then you get the profitability and the computation of what's the ROI, basically, of each and so here you can combine some depending on how complex you want it to be, you can provide some and compute what's going to be the impact. And that brings your house to score B, and you get the exact combination of prices, like prices are not just added up, because when you have you do multiple renovation, you might get a different type of subsidies that we compute for you. So, yeah,
and yeah. So you get, you get your grade, which is the grading system used in most European country. And then you get the difference, different renovation you could be doing, what going to be the impact. And then you get the profitability and the computation of what's the ROI, basically, of each and so here you can combine some depending on how complex you want it to be, you can provide some and compute what's going to be the impact.

So, yeah,
S Speaker 124:22very interesting. Edwards, it's very simple. I just wonder if you guys are exploring some sort of virality component to it, because it has a consumer force facing front. And sometimes we have seen that having a B to B to C play, where if there is a virality in the last 2c component, that really drives sales, quite a lot. So if you can think of something like that, that could be a huge growth factor.
very interesting. Edwards, it's very simple. I just wonder if you guys are exploring some sort of virality component to it, because it has a consumer force facing front.

S Speaker 224:50Interesting. I know we already see there is a bit of not virality, but network effect industry, because everyone knows each other, yeah. And so everyone is like, flexing. This is my new tool to do innovation. And so we see you starting to have some inbound from from competitors of other companies saying, like, I want to try it as well and try it. But interesting the virality parts that could be very interesting, yep,
Interesting. I know we already see there is a bit of not virality, but network effect industry, because everyone knows each other, yeah. And so everyone is like, flexing.

S Speaker 125:16because there's a consumer focused part of it. And for sure, if consumers are driving sales, you will get the middle part of the businesses coming inbound to you in an exponential fashion. But yeah, of course, something that you can explore. Because completely from a consumer user perspective, I was very curious of to run this for my own home and try to understand where I am sitting right now. But a very quick question, yeah, please. Word No, no, go for it. A very quick question on the regulation slide, do you see any risks on regulation and compliance across different geographies?

S Speaker 225:56To be honest, not really what we because there is this, this massive tsunami of energy renovation coming in and is driven by higher order, which is climate change and the European Union just is this massive objective of renovation. Now what we see is that each each country, is kind of changing and modulating some of the regional policies. But because we are more software, we're able to be on different geographies, different countries. That means we can kind of average out those changes. So like in France, there was a big push for heat pumps, like two years ago, and now the push is more in Italy. And so yeah, we can kind of average out the risks, but because, once again, you're outside of the rip of the operation, we're giving that solution to the operators. We shouldn't be impacted too much.

S Speaker 126:51Got it and in your calculations, the ROI that you calculate for some of these services, do the incentives pay up play a very big part of it? How like, in terms of percentage, roughly, how much do you think that is contributing to the entire ROI? Yeah,
Got it and in your calculations, the ROI that you calculate for some of these services, do the incentives pay up play a very big part of it? How like, in terms of percentage, roughly, how much do you think that is contributing to the entire ROI? Yeah,

S Speaker 227:13so ROI is very interesting, because it's one, I believe it's one of the most important feature of our product, being very precise financially, and having a financial model that goes fetch the prediction of electricity prices throughout the years, the impact on the assets price, on the house price, stuff like that. So ROI is really key for us. And in terms of what part is subsidies, what part is not subsidies,
so ROI is very interesting, because it's one, I believe it's one of the most important feature of our product, being very precise financially, and having a financial model that goes fetch the prediction of electricity prices throughout the years, the impact on the assets price, on the house price, stuff like that.

So ROI is really key for us. And in terms of what part is subsidies, what part is not subsidies,
S Speaker 227:44a lot of drive from those subsidies in order to accelerate, basically, the adoption. So if you see that installing a heat pump is only five years of ROI for you, you would be happy to not wait for your old furnace to break, but you already, already slightly done today. And so if I can't give you your percentage, it depends also on the subsidy. You don't have subsidies, but it's definitely a big part of the push. Without subsidies would be, or at least the options would be restricted to just a few that exactly Got

S Speaker 128:23it, got it. That's that's very exciting. Edward, and this has been a great conversation, man, thanks a lot for your time. Yeah. Last, last question on my end, are you raising right now? Do you plan to be raising anytime soon?
it, got it. That's that's very exciting. Edward, and this has been a great conversation, man, thanks a lot for your time. Yeah. Last, last question on my end, are you raising right now? Do you plan to be raising anytime soon?

S Speaker 228:34Yes. So we are raising right now. We are raising around that's 1.5 million. So that's bit lower than you guys average ticket or mid ticket, but yeah, we're raising 1.5 at a vs safes with a 15 cap, okay? And we actually already have 40% of that committed, so there's about a million left. So I know it doesn't, yeah, it doesn't feel exactly your minimum ticket, but I know I really love this chat. So if we have the right program boards would be, we can move things around and, and, yeah, and I don't know if you guys do smaller checks to like Scout program or whatever, also happy to discuss about that.
Yes. So we are raising right now. We are raising around that's 1.5 million.

S Speaker 129:21I would I what I can do, Edward is, yeah, it's a little bit small, and the constraint comes from the fact that we are a corporate fund, so we have to involve our legal, our finance, our accounting team, and if it's a smaller check that does not really move the needle for them. So that's where the constraint comes from. But I would love to have a chat with our managing director. He and I are work. He's Carlos, and he is on the board of span, so he and I are working together on the electrification thesis for the fund. Let me have a chat with him internally. If nothing, I'd love to schedule a call between the two of you. And if there are any synergies between Qualcomm span, Qualcomm ventures that we can explore. Would love to do that. Okay, can you, can you send me your deck? Would love to sort of evaluate that a little bit, create my own analysis and have a discussion internally with the team, and I'll get back to you by early next week.

S Speaker 230:16Early next week. Okay, sounds great, perfect. I'll send you the deck, and I'll keep you updated as well, because if like thing changes in our in our round, and there's less spot available, but, yeah, I'll send you an early next week. Should be should be good enough. So for sure, Sam, it was a great discussion. I look it's really interesting. Some investors don't know the space at all other love it, and it's so much better when you guys love it,

S Speaker 130:45for sure it it's not a space that you will initially look at and see that it's so big, but there's a lot of tailwinds.

S Speaker 230:53It's like a huge tailwind. It's in its massive and we believe also that construction is going to go down, and it's all going to be renovation. So everything is going to be renovation two years, and it's going to get even bigger. So, we're excited
