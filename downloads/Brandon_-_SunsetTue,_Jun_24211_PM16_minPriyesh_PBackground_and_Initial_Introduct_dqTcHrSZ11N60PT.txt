S Speaker 21:09I came back for one weekend just to meet them. But I plan to sort of reconnect with a lot of venture VCs that I had met during my time there. Tried to very actively create an ecosystem that runtime because I was trying to pivot into venture. Maybe I can give you a background about myself. I'm ultimately from India, and was did my undergrad in India, was working for a series a company thought saw it grow from series A to unicorn. Currently they're fighting for an IPO. So that was a great experience. I was in the growth team, then went on to take a lot of responsibilities, start a new sort of business model for the company, and at the same time, was also very involved in several early stage ventures in growth product. And realized venture would be a great place for me to sort of now find a home. So moved to the US in 2022 did my MBA from UCLA, worked with a lot of funds. Morpheus in LA, I interned with them for a year. Mango ventures in the Bay Area. Interned with them for some time. Met a lot of VCs in LA, so it's a very tight ecosystem, I would say, much, much more tighter than the Bay Area. And enjoyed that space quite a lot, and then graduated out of UCLA, joined Qualcomm as a senior associate, currently investing in AI, robotics, physical AI, enterprise. Ai, a lot a lot of attitudes industrial automation, sometimes around automobile tech stack, sometimes around mobile technology. So everywhere, if you see there's a degree of compute or connectivity, is where Qualcomm and just has a good sort of standing. And in terms of just how the fund operates, been around for 25 years, deployed more than two more than two billions in capital. Half, 250, plus active portfolio companies. Today, it's a global fund, so we have offices across the group, five or six different regions, and check sizes at two to $15 million so we prefer to come at around series A but more recently, AI specifically, they started doing seed as well. Okay, okay,

Okay, okay,
S Speaker 32:39very cool. Quick background on myself. I grew up here in Southern California, LA area grad out here Cal State, Fullerton. Yeah, I focus on finance their day job. I worked in financial services for nearly 10 years, but my dream was actually music. Hence, a lot of so I mean nights and weekends. You know, I was, I was hustling my way into the big studios in LA eventually started my own recording studio. I was filmed and operated that I was audio engineer, producer, songwriter, you know. So I was, I was chasing that dream. Yeah, it took me maybe too long to realize, I think I was born a decade too late. I mean, the record industry was just changing, and getting a record deal was a thing in the past, you know, and it and I saw NASDAQ, I experienced iTunes. And by the time that Spotify came to the US, around 2010 you know, I think that was when I realized, like, all right, instead of trying to go to sony, universal and do all this, I need to figure out how to work at a company like Spotify or, you know, I had never heard the word startup. I never heard the word venture capital, right? Living in SoCal, especially growing up in the late 90s, 2000s right? So I had a knack for finance, investing, you know, I booked a business, private wealth. So I love talking markets and managing capital. But again, my passion, if you will, was, was music, by way of that, tech and digital media. Wanted to figure out how to bring these worlds together. That was like my loose North Star bonus, if I could find a way to have purpose and impact as well, you know. And I went off to business school to figure that out. So that was the first time at SoCal I went to Wharton, so, you know, I left and went to the East Coast. Focused on finance. There. I did dual degree program at Harvard, Kennedy School. So I focused on economics. Interned a couple times in New York, tried investment banking, like a tech media group, which was cool. I did equity research as well. Found level of research more than banking, you know, I just loved, like diving an inch wide, mile deep, being an expert in a very particular subcategory. By chance, I ended up covering the internet sector, which has awesome coverage. So a lot of like E commerce, FinTech, payments, on one hand, the flow of money really in goods and then content. So a lot of social, ad tech, gaming publishers learned a ton. Did some great IPOs, some really interesting reports. Clients decided not to go the hedge fund route, where most people got it from sell side. While I was in New York, I started working with Harlem capital back in 2018 they were friends of mine. They were at business school. And again, you don't know what you don't know. I didn't realize starting a venture fund, you know, in my peer group, you know, outrage was an option. I took the venture classes. I was doing some angel investing, right? I loved thinking 10 years out, more than, like, quarter by quarter, you know, EPS, are they? Are they gonna be us or beat right? And so that's kind of what with me. I've been, I've been stuck on venture ever since, and want to do this rest of my career. That's what prompted me to go to Samsung, kind of break into venture, if you will, right by way of, like, corporate innovation and then corporate venture. So I was at Samsung for almost five years, based in Mountain View. Was going to Korea every quarter, working with the CEOs of the business units, and I reported to the chief innovation officer directly. So I learned a ton there. On the business side, we had early stage venture fund, very similar to you. You know, a few 100 portfolio companies have been around nearly 10 years at that time, and I probably did about 20 deals on the platform, mostly seed and series, a really just continuing a lot of the same areas I covered in Morgan Stanley. I was covering there, learned a ton. My partner and I both left there. We were at Samsung together. We've been friends for 13 years. We left a little over two years ago to start sunset. So He's based in San Francisco, but we're both from LA. He's from Long Beach. And again, we met here. It's just two of us, two GPS raised up, you know, pretty small fund. The goal is just getting the business as fast as possible, like a concept fund. So we're writing a lot of like, 25 50k checks off, 200k you know, just, just building improved concept portfolio. We've got about 32 investments now, making a few more throughout the rest of the year. And then we'll be, we'll be fully deployed, which is exciting. And then we're thinking about what's fun to look like. And so obviously, I guess I don't even need to say, but I've been big on community building. Started emerging. La a year and a half, maybe two years ago. It's almost by chance, you know, and it kind of took off. And to your point, it's a it's a small, tight knit community. I think it's growing, which is great to see. But what's missing, though, compared to like SF and even NY, is the density and the frequency of just events and collaborations and like serendipity, you know, running into each other and and all of that. And so just not want to stay on the sidelines, you know, trying to lean in and to do my part as a community leader. Just want to see the LA ecosystem continue to grow and thrive and create more opportunities down here. So, so that's emerging. La, yeah. So a lot of in person events, you know, some bigger ones, some small internet ones, a newsletter, and just trying to spot, like, good people doing things, investors, founders that are British.

I took the venture classes. I was doing some angel investing, right? I loved thinking 10 years out, more than, like, quarter by quarter, you know, EPS, are they? Are they gonna be us or beat right? And so that's kind of what with me. I've been, I've been stuck on venture ever since, and want to do this rest of my career. That's what prompted me to go to Samsung, kind of break into venture, if you will, right by way of, like, corporate innovation and then corporate venture. So I was at Samsung for almost five years, based in Mountain View. Was going to Korea every quarter, working with the CEOs of the business units, and I reported to the chief innovation officer directly. So I learned a ton there. On the business side, we had early stage venture fund, very similar to you. You know, a few 100 portfolio companies have been around nearly 10 years at that time, and I probably did about 20 deals on the platform, mostly seed and series, a really just continuing a lot of the same areas I covered in Morgan Stanley. I was covering there, learned a ton. My partner and I both left there. We were at Samsung together. We've been friends for 13 years. We left a little over two years ago to start sunset. So He's based in San Francisco, but we're both from LA. He's from Long Beach. And again, we met here. It's just two of us, two GPS raised up, you know, pretty small fund. The goal is just getting the business as fast as possible, like a concept fund. So we're writing a lot of like, 25 50k checks off, 200k you know, just, just building improved concept portfolio. We've got about 32 investments now, making a few more throughout the rest of the year. And then we'll be, we'll be fully deployed, which is exciting. And then we're thinking about what's fun to look like. And so obviously, I guess I don't even need to say, but I've been big on community building. Started emerging. La a year and a half, maybe two years ago. It's almost by chance, you know, and it kind of took off. And to your point, it's a it's a small, tight knit community. I think it's growing, which is great to see. But what's missing, though, compared to like SF and even NY, is the density and the frequency of just events and collaborations and like serendipity, you know, running into each other and and all of that. And so just not want to stay on the sidelines, you know, trying to lean in and to do my part as a community leader. Just want to see the LA ecosystem continue to grow and thrive and create more opportunities down here. So, so that's emerging. La, yeah. So a lot of in person events, you know, some bigger ones, some small internet ones, a newsletter, and just trying to spot, like, good people doing things, investors, founders that are British.
S Speaker 26:46That's an amazing career. Brandon, and I can relate to so many of those steps your Samsung journey to sort of starting a front of fund by yourself. That's like my aspiration down the line. That's something I want to do. So a lot of successes in there that I possibly would like to replicate for myself. But that's pretty amazing. One of the points that stood out my Brandon was when I was at UCLA, I tried to sort of create a community as well. I was the president of our entrepreneur Association at UCLA. Tried to host a lot of events, brought in a lot of venture capitalists on the table come work with UCLA. We also host a lot of, I would say, summits, a day long summit where we bring a lot of panelists, have discussions, networking sessions and things like that. So if that's ever of interest to you, I can happily connect you to someone in the current school ecosystem. That could be a great partnership

S Speaker 37:21opportunity as well. Yeah, we love that. I mean, the more, the better. I love putting on events with other people, or just supporting, amplifying, do whatever I can kind of bring our minds together, if anything, I actually do want to do more, longer form kind of events, yeah, half day, full day, summits, you know, panels, things like that, programming and just, just to bring shine more of a light, you know. And ecosystem, maybe even attracts folks right from, from out of town. Would be, would be ideal, you know, we have things like LA tech week, front Summit. We don't have a ton of those, those, you know, summits, right? Things that pull people down in the cross country. So that'd be the goal. You know, ultimately, absolutely okay. And I'll check with the

S Speaker 312:18think a lot of the same areas that we have been investing, obviously, like, just based on trends or sort of hype cycles or exposure, you know, you might dial up and down a little bit, but pretty much looking at the application of emerging technologies. It's obviously AI, a lot these days, but the way we've always thought about it is, you know, AIs are really like an intelligence layer and interactive layer. So a lot of spatial computing robotics have, you know, embodied AI, you know, ar, VR, and then really, like decentralized technology, so abstract use cases of blockchain. So those are sort of the the emerging technologies generally look at the top half of a stack. So that being applied in a few sectors, you know, that we've covered for many years. I think myself as a sector analyst, I guess still right, just by by, by virtue of my past experience. And so it's a lot of creative industries, media, entertainment, gaming, IP, financial services, commerce and software more and with software tends to be more bottoms up, consumer, prosumer, small, medium business in terms of go to market, let's say, and persona,

S Speaker 213:08very interesting. And a lot of intersection there as well. This is great. Well, what typically at Qualcomm, what we have been doing more extensively in the last year or so is that the corporate itself has expanded across a lot of platforms. So earlier, we would be a mobile player. But now, apart from mobile compute, we have compute going in PCs, a lot of xr classes. We are 90% of xr market is Qualcomm. Then a lot of robotics play as well, and then a cloud data center play as well. So we have quite a big spread across different compute platforms. And hence that allows us to invest in applied AI as such, across all the sectors you mentioned, and a few more. So we are also very actively partnering with a lot of startups in that space, trying to sort of get them quantized internally at Qualcomm, get them adoption at Qualcomm. Go with some some of these startups. Go to GDM for some of them. We have given them big stages and demos across Computex and a few more keynotes. So always happy to also explore some of these collaborations. If any of your portfolio company fits the bill, happy to connect them to internal views and see if we can do something like that. We have now have a very dedicated platform person as well. So some of these efforts are more structured, and we'll, can, we will be able to make
