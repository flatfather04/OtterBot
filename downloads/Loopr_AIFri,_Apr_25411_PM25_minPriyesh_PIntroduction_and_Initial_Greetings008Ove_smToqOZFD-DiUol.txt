S Speaker 20:4116. Okay, so decent sized company. We are actually in a very typical place. That's really where we are right now. Yes, it's kind of like it's always really, I mean, I think this, I don't know what's the space like, what size of I

S Speaker 30:58would love to know about the fund, how we operate in and then we take it from there. From there. So I'm an investor at Qualcomm ventures, a senior associate here, working directly with a matching partner, and particularly look at AI investments. In the past one year I have, I have done a couple of computer vision investments. So that's an interesting place for me personally, but also for the company, because Qualcomm, as you know, we ship probably more than a billion chips every year with power so many cameras. So computer vision internally is a very big, friendly focus area for us. So that's why it's excited to know more. But overall, about the fund, we are a global fund. Our offices are in here in us, in Latin America, in Brazil, Israel, China, India and London. And couple of check sizes are roughly between two to $15 million so we are typically a cease A investor, but at times, in AI, given the round sizes have changed so much, we have started doing seed as well. So I think, for that matter, the space that you are in, or the stage that you are in, also fits. So that's interesting. And then, apart from Ai, we have made investments in industrial automation, IoT, in some companies which actually operate in similar areas as you are targeting, I would say, so some, some in industrial automation, automobile tech stack, XR and robotics. So those are some areas that we are excited about, broadly speaking, strategic arm of Qualcomm ventures. But we make our decisions independently, so we we have to follow the same financial decisions or discipline as any

S Speaker 32:20million. So that's where we are. About five to 7 million would be as we checked for Okay, okay, great, and you can eat. But most of the investments we do, we do not lead about, I would say, rough figures. 20% of my investments we would lead. 80% will just participate in, okay, okay. But you're open to leading if it's required, yeah, if it's required, and if it fits well in our strategy, where we feel we can add value, we're open to leading. We have read in some investments where we felt we couldn't, we felt we could, we could make a big difference. Okay, okay, awesome.

S Speaker 32:57generally. So we have a couple of round of discussions internally. So there is, there is a partners meeting every Monday where we discuss companies. But then we have stages where in the different geo leads also participated, and eventually an IC meeting where we have some of our business units also chime in. So that is how our process would typically be. Between some of these stages, we would have the management team present to the entire Qualcomm addressing so that's where everyone gets together. View of that, even from the founders. But then other than that, it would be one lead. I it would be one lead. I am typically taking it through

For that matter, I directly report to the manager, but apart from me, everyone else in the team is a partner level. So I tend to work with almost every department, and then every one of us, we have check writing abilities, so we take our

S Speaker 24:51on what we are doing is kind of like I would say people differentiate. So a little bit about me right now. They come from manufacturing background. My family's business into manufacturing. So, you know, born and development at environment, saw the problem of quality firsthand while I was working in a night in my dad's company. So that's where I got the inspiration of solving this problem quality inspection. Did company Science Engineering. Moved to Europe in my MBA, was working with largest CPG companies. Saw the same problem at a much better scheme for packaging and packaging and leaving defects, and then moved to us. Did a data science fellowship, was part of a year consulting startup for two years, which was focusing on retail use cases, search personalization, recommendation, and always want to go back and solve the problems. So first time. So that made me start loop in 2020, what the end of 2021? So a little bit background of what, why I'm doing what I'm doing today, and it's really more based on the experience that I've had so far in terms of the market opportunity, the market opportunity, right? For quality, 12% of today's, I mean, quality is a big issue especially, I'm sure if you've done computer vision companies, you'll know that at once, the cost of quality, the cost of inspection, is a big cost that every manufacturing company you know, goes to today, especially with what's what's happening around, you know, even still, even retiring, and then it's getting even harder and harder in order to hire new people. So the gap is it's becoming bigger, like the cost is going higher. So now the scrap costs have gone up. Like all the recalls, what happened with going last year. It kind of gives us an idea that there's more and more issues that's happening in the space, right? Like, it's like a lot of focus in the past when companies will look into was micro inspections, so like, 10 scratches, those kind of defects. But now we're talking about a lot on macro because, you know, people would rely on humans to do the job really well for like, all these years, but those people are not around. So it's like, it on x, and now they tend to make mistakes. So the processes that you have had, like the dependency that you could have it on humans for like, all these years now you cannot have it the same way. So you need automation in even in macro inspections, like SMB verification processes. And that's really where we found us, a place that really required solution, where a fixed camera cannot solve the problem. So you are majority of the machine building machine vision. So comics and games were the ones who basically brought the technology in the market and was involved. Then computer vision came along, then AI companies started with AI models, but again, everything around the fixed pattern, and that's really where we are trying to bring a big differentiator around. How can you use a tablet based solution to do the inspection on the battery

S Speaker 37:11flow? The entire computer ecosystem was kind of geared towards like micro inspections, finding small scratches dent so the entire ecosystem, right from the camera manufacturers to the ISVs, like us, they are looking and focusing on these micro so using fixed capital, exact same exact same part, exact same environment, what we have found is that the bigger problem is in macro inspections, if you have an engine, or if you have, like the Boeing example, plugging in a COVID, how do you make sure that all the bones are plugged in on that is all manual, like you just rely on the human inspectors to make sure that it's done properly. That is properly. There is no automation. There's no traceability, and the existing computer ecosystem cannot solve that problem. You cannot have fixed cameras pointing at every different area of a large object, like a plane or an engine to do these inspections. You need something with an operator or an inspector. Or in the future, can have like a hole that you can move the camera around these large objects. Now no one is solving for that, but that is a huge opportunity and a huge problem that we've seen in the last couple of years. All the capital division relies on six camera I agree, a couple of portfolio companies that come to my mind

The entire computer ecosystem was kind of geared towards like micro inspections, finding small scratches dent so the entire ecosystem, right from the camera manufacturers to the ISVs, like us, they are looking and focusing on these micro so using fixed capital, exact same exact same part, exact same environment, what we have found is that the bigger problem is in macro inspections, if you have an engine, or if you have, like the Boeing example, plugging in a COVID, how do you make sure that all the bones are plugged in on that is all manual, like you just rely on the human inspectors to make sure that it's done properly. That is properly. There is no automation. There's no traceability, and the existing computer ecosystem cannot solve that problem. You cannot have fixed cameras pointing at every different area of a large object, like a plane or an engine to do these inspections. You need something with an operator or an inspector. Or in the future, can have like a hole that you can move the camera around these large objects. Now no one is solving for that, but that is a huge opportunity and a huge problem that we've seen in the last couple of years.

S Speaker 310:05also, we've solved for the mobile inspection, which is unstructured, video free, like, you know, tracking objects in an unstructured map. So fixed camera. Yeah, we can do fixed cameras, yeah. But what we're trying to go for, the differentiator, is mobile inspections and keeping an eye on the future where, you know, there will be a lot more body automation. Like I said, we're getting the brain so that our back end, our system, can be integrated with whatever that robotic, robot is doing the inspection. So that's why we're focusing to be harder than possible. And so the way we've done this, we find patterns for this. We have built a real time infrastructure which can do real time video based influence from our clients or architecture. I think it's maybe close to the video. Yeah, let's start

S Speaker 210:53there are multiple parts that you need to spend, right? So there's like, the idea of choosing this one was more because this was a big quantity for the kids. This was a big warrant issue for the customer. So even when you think about manufacturing floor, everybody has their own KPIs. You know, our operator has his KPIs. Of any different is more about the work done. How efficiently Can I go? That is what a factory person is like. How many defective slaves can I reduce? You know, how many? How can I bring in? How can I ship more parts where to use the kind of things to open inspection space? Whereas for a VP of manufacturing is, like, whatever claims or equal, because that's the thing coming off of my property that I had for that year, right? So everybody's APIs are so different, but it's all aligned, and some of those, so there's a value for everyone with this application. So we started with quality games, because, like, when you talk about quality things, like certain use cases, which is, like, very, very critical, the chances of making errors are really high. So they're much more, you know, the chances of quality games is much higher. So we went for those ones, and one of them was steering traps. So this basically connects your gear box to your steering wheel. So it's a very critical inspection, you can imagine, because, you know, that fails. There's

S Speaker 311:49just one single board which holds the entire steering trap and the gear to get there's a fault in that board. Your steering gear can come off from the steering wheel, and it's why this happens while driver is on the road. Yeah. So I'm assuming this is more of a micro inspection problem, rather than a macro in that, no, this is a macro. This is macro. So you'll see it. So we
just one single board which holds the entire steering trap and the gear to get there's a fault in that board.

S Speaker 212:07show you, once we show you, then you'll see we start with inspection. And you know, within fraction of second, inspection starts. And you're talking about inspecting these big parts. There's no scratches, although these are big ones. This what you see. This is what you're basically in. You need to inspect it from different angles.
show you, once we show you, then you'll see we start with inspection. And you know, within fraction of second, inspection starts. And you're talking about inspecting these big parts.

S Speaker 312:24You cannot get a full view from just one angle. You need to, kind of like, that's how the union is also doing it, looking around it to make sure that it's, you know, the groups are coming out properly from the back. Otherwise it's not fast. So that's why
You cannot get a full view from just one angle. You need to, kind of like, that's how the union is also doing it, looking around it to make sure that it's, you know, the groups are coming out properly from the back. Otherwise it's not fast. So that's why

S Speaker 212:41you need something which is mobile around going on, but why that issue happened? So it you can see here. So the nut is not properly fast, so that's the PIN code level. And since it's not properly fast, and you know, this says this is not properly connected C to bed. So, and we also showing what top number does, who worked on it for time already. So there's a complete traceability. And this goes in their MES system. So if they get any vertically, they can pull up the record. And now they have a picture in the past, it was all about a human basically saying, I did this. But, like, did you do it? Well, there was no way to check, right, because you just going trust me on their words. But now it's all becoming, it's very transparent. So you can see all of this. The operator can give a feedback, also that I agree disagree. They can fix it and they can reinspect it. So that is also, you know, the new, the updated one, final one, also gets in the system. So all of this is getting, you know, stored. And you can see like the kind of pictures, since it's constantly moving, it's really bad pictures, and still, the system has

S Speaker 313:26been able to detect so tell me. Can you give me a top level view of how the architecture of your algorithms work? Is it still object detection for different use cases? What size of data would you require to print it on different use cases? How is it scalable? Yeah, so there are those are the two key innovations which we've built. One is around doing this unstructured inspection. But you know, every frame is different. Between object detection, where every single frame which our system is different, the angle, the distance, the light environment is different, we're able to do real time object detection and serve the results to the end user in real time. So we built that infrastructure which is a key innovation. And the second key innovation hits on the point of the data, right? Like, how much data does this need? And we have been able to bring this down to like, three or four videos to get a baseline accuracy of 70% so we have built foundational models which are sharp enough that will just, you know, like a handful of videos, taking handful of videos, and fine tuning those, we're able to get, like, a baseline 75 80% and then percent. And then, as in how the operator keeps using it, the system gets better and better. We have continuous feedback too. So once we've achieved that baseline accuracy, or let's say, 70 80% accuracy, but after that, as you keep using it, you're feeding it more and more data in line. So that is another innovation which we brought like this is in line training. It's supervised. In line training. Nobody's going and annotating 20 of that as the operator uses it. It's learning. And how do you collect feedback from the operator in what way is it inbuilt in the product? So if you saw like it was in 10 hours,
been able to detect so tell me. Can you give me a top level view of how the architecture of your algorithms work? Is it still object detection for different use cases?

S Speaker 316:06get our system and to the customer, the sooner we can start using it, the better gets faster, and that is a radical shift from our traditional supervised learning based computer, which works they spent three months just collecting data as the sooner we use it, they will student use it, they want start using it. The systems will keep getting better, because we have that feedback understood, and that's interesting. Can you let's can we shift focus to the JDM side of things? Now? Is it a sales function? What's attraction like? How big are each of these accounts? Customers already?

S Speaker 216:39Eight enterprise customers already, and these are some of the biggest, as you can see. You know, such aerospace and automotive is a big focus right now, and this can scale is not really right. Like we have all only every super 6 million, and we've already have a lot of traction out of these eight Toyota standard trust and standard industries. We have sold more than 100 additional licenses already. Toyota and saffron, we have already sent them the proposals for additional licenses, so which we are going to close in a month time frame. So basically, out of eight customers, four of them have already, you know, we have scaled within four accounts already. So each of these accounts are in the grocery. In fact, Microsoft has an industry experience, central EPC in Silicon Valley, and one in here is only startup solutions live, so they show our solution to customers all around the world, like for 2000 companies. So there's a lot of traction. So in fact, as you know, as I can also make you speak to the CTO for manufacturing account within Microsoft. He's our sponsor for this project. So we'll be working with a lot of accounts within within Microsoft ecosystem, and not be upsetting. I mean, the new logos, we also building partnership ecosystem, So Microsoft is one, but then we also building premium partnerships, so like land, gam attack and access cameras to camera manufacturers were planning to have this integrated in their cameras as they are selling it to their

So there's a lot of traction. So in fact, as you know, as I can also make you speak to the CTO for manufacturing account within Microsoft. He's our sponsor for this project. So we'll be working with a lot of accounts within within Microsoft ecosystem, and not be upsetting. I mean, the new logos, we also building partnership ecosystem, So Microsoft is one, but then we also building premium partnerships, so like land, gam attack and access cameras to camera manufacturers were planning to have this integrated in their cameras as they are selling it to their
Eight enterprise customers already, and these are some of the biggest, as you can see. You know, such aerospace and automotive is a big focus right now, and this can scale is not really right. Like we have all only every super 6 million, and we've already have a lot of traction out of these eight Toyota standard trust and standard industries. We have sold more than 100 additional licenses already. Toyota and saffron, we have already sent them the proposals for additional licenses, so which we are going to close in a month time frame. So basically, out of eight customers, four of them have already, you know, we have scaled within four accounts already. So each of these accounts are in the grocery.

S Speaker 218:00slide, exactly I got you in the slide. So we give you an example. So danger, the first contract was 65k so out of that 60 25k was, you know, implementation. So he gave a subscription. We sold them. Second contract for 75k where 25k was implementation. So if you see, the implementation went down and the subscription was 50k we are now closing with another contract, with danger for another factory. And over there we just have one license, which is 25 license, which is 45k so we're completely away from subscription. Now from implementation, we don't have any more implementation. But what are our services are getting started with the customers. You don't want to do a lot of things. Numbers of the product has been so now we know like, hey, we have a clear part of how we will vote for the implementation. So now there's no like, I think it was about like, when we also started page. We also like more like fixed camera, those kind of approach. But we struggled with scaling because we realized the same issue was, like, every time you go to customer, you know, it's about setting up the hardware sometimes, and then collecting the data, and then with micro, right the percentage of accuracy that we're looking at is 95 200% with macro, their own accuracy today is 80% they're never gonna ask me, bring me like, a 95% model, because they know that's not possible, the concept that they have to. So there's a lot of breaking space in terms of, we really don't believe, we don't care, that you need to get me a 95%

S Speaker 219:20So it is there, but it's not the d1 so it's not like, you know, let's say, for example, when we did for Boeing, Boeing's clear. It was clear that we needed 95% accuracy. Because we're looking at composite process, our scope of error is varying. We are not going to get your solution deployed and before it reaches nine 5% for us, for dialer, the idea is that when we hire somebody, we don't expect that human to be 95% accurate day one or even 80% accurate. So basically, get them started. They need to shadow somebody, learn the job, get hold, you know, understand it, and then it has to get better. So what is it danger? When we started, it was like 75% today, the muscle is about 90. I think

S Speaker 319:52you're probably talking about what value we're bringing. So the biggest value, which also customers keep repeating when they talk to us, is consistency. They're struggling with them. So consistency of inspections, what I perceive as might be different from what you have seen, depending on the kind of pay that's a very big factor. So even if the best inspectors might be 80% not all their so they are accuracy and volume, like if they see over six months, might be closer to 60% that they were 60% right, 40% they were wrong. And the other thing is speed, this is much faster, just to deliver a consistent accuracy at a much faster speed, that's making our efficiency makes sense. Makes sense. One more question back again at the contracts. So how are contracts priced? Is it usage based? Is it more specific section based? How are you sort of building the contract?

S Speaker 220:38Yeah, so I right now what we're doing is that the first license that we buy our factory floor for, let's say, first tablet. It starts from $45,000 so we don't

20:46so that's our starting point, but that's per tablet.
so that's our starting point, but that's per tablet.
so that's our starting point, but that's per tablet.
so that's our starting point, but that's per tablet.
S Speaker 220:48So therefore the first use case, first tablet for every factory, because all of our customers have a lot of factories. Like, rental alone has 150 factories. Landlord has, like, you know, just in North America, they have eight factories. So each one of it, the first one is 45 now, every additional tablet that you want inspected at five places, and you have five tablets, each additional could be like $1,000 so that's the price. And then every additional use case you add that's like additional 2000 to $2,500 so like, I'm using a tablet now for pin code, open, I'm adding 20. I'm adding all these multiple ones. That's going to be additional money. Long term, long term uprising should evolves are not as clear at scale, right? So we're not able to build like we don't want to underprice about unlimited

S Speaker 321:26use that go at it unlimited use you just pay a fixed cost. But eventually it could evolve into more of our consumption. And then we also
use that go at it unlimited use you just pay a fixed cost. But eventually it could evolve into more of our consumption. And then we also
use that go at it unlimited use you just pay a fixed cost. But eventually it could evolve into more of our consumption. And then we also
use that go at it unlimited use you just pay a fixed cost. But eventually it could evolve into more of our consumption. And then we also
S Speaker 221:34need an enterprise license. So for example, danger, the corporate is already involved. So they wanted to see that option by two to three factories, and then they want to make it manually for mandatory for any factor, because they do the same inspection in all the factories, everything is exactly the same, and not just in automatically in Europe and within in Asia. So it makes kind of a sense that, hey, what now, let's look at an enterprise license that for these use cases. I mean, we want to make it money that
need an enterprise license. So for example, danger, the corporate is already involved. So they wanted to see that option by two to three factories, and then they want to make it manually for mandatory for any factor, because they do the same inspection in all the factories, everything is exactly the same, and not just in automatically in Europe and within in Asia.

So apart from that, there's not been anything that's been ultimately how our application is designed. This is our new normal pipeline we have sent three new customers already proposal, which is like, you know, so hopefully our number from each is going to be 11 by end of this quarter.

S Speaker 222:41So this is going to be a price round. We are just started this conversation since March. We are talking to a couple of funds for M 12, Microsoft's. M 12 is one we're looking at in charge capital is another one which has powers money out of Germany. We have also spoken to NGP capital, which is so we're looking at, like, a couple of funds talking to them right now, some of them a couple of conversations. So the goal would be to look for a lead 5 million check size, and then really looking for a lot of strategic funds, so not a lot of financial VCs. But like, really, you can go in the services industry make some so and our own existing customers, like ankle and saffron ventures, they also interested in this round. So the goal is, like, really, to find a lead right now. You know, who can put in that 5 million check? Because the other three, I am not super worried about existing ones can cover it. So that's, that's really what the other component,
So this is going to be a price round. We are just started this conversation since March. We are talking to a couple of funds for M 12, Microsoft's.

S Speaker 323:31I think, being guided here i i put, I don't believe we would be able to lead the round, but, but I will hold on to that thought for now. Let me do a little bit more research, have a discussion with the team, probably as a follow up call, include Priyesh as well. For one of

S Speaker 324:00I know that there's a huge push to build chips which can do inference, like Qualcomm, like that is going to be the play at all conferences. I mean, it's obvious there is that aspect to this. A lot of our, at least computer company, we try to shift, I'm not sure, but I'm assuming your AI inference workloads today are on the cloud, so we're trying to shift some of them natively on device. So I do see that scenario for sure, and

S Speaker 224:21that's a big focus for us, because a lot of companies are not okay to move to cloud completely. So if we can get this figure out, it's just, you know, I mean, more important push for this, it's absolutely,

S Speaker 324:29absolutely, thanks a lot for the time team. It's interesting. Let me take a little bit deeper. Come back to you early next week and we can follow up on that. Yeah,
