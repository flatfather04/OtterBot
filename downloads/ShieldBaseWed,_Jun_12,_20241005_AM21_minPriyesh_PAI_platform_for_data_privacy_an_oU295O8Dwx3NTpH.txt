S Speaker 11:23of us in the cloud for some smaller clients. There's a huge gap in the market in Southeast Asia but globally, where many companies want to innovate and they want to use AI and then alums, whether it's an FMCG, firm finance and so on, or real estate, and maybe some big corporates, even open AI or Microsoft, targeting big enterprises, right. This gap in the market where even getting started in those big companies, but in between companies with more than 500 employees summary up to 10,000 or 1000s of employees that sit on Shehata, not AI and that's where we come in and we even did research as a way as an entry point for Glenn was start automating some of this workflow so they have internally. So yeah, more than one protect keen that sensitive information.

S Speaker 12:36Data privacy and also the sector that we're looking at, you know, companies that might not be very tech savvy, but they're sensible in terms of revenue and but they do FMCG going to state and whatnot. So they might have another thing. They might have limited capabilities in terms of building in AI or doing something with AI. So we give them this platform and the pitches by implementation. ways we'll use a hosted version or on prem in become an AI company, just like that. So that's how they see you know, okay, they can start innovating, they can, you know, remain relevant in the market and whatnot. So that's the pitch you become an AI company by just implementing into research and from there we take you to a journey of workflow automation, you know, at a later stage. Yeah, that's how we're looking at it.

S Speaker 13:27Mostly in Southeast Asia still? We have some some folks in Malaysia, some folks in Singapore, and most of the engineering team is in Indonesia. Because I also heard that from abusive startup I YC company that I build it for. So I have this engineering sample of people that I know and I work with them before in the past. So you know, I also hired them for this adventure. So that's good.

S Speaker 23:51Oh to YC company in YC self inspection before
S Speaker 13:58before I did one sale in my previous startup, my career is mostly in FinTech. So I will say things exchanges and fintech. I'm actually from Argentina, but I live in the US for a while and I work with Lending Club with a founding team of Lending Club. Then I moved to China many years also working in FinTech moved to Singapore and moved to different countries in the region. And then in recent years, I started an open banking startup just like a plan in the US. So I started a similar business and that business, you know, we've got investment from YC and many global investors but then I really exited on that. And then, you know, I move on, I was telling us semi retired, to be honest, in the past year, but many people in my network started telling me oh, we want to use AI. But we have concerns about data privacy. We don't know how to do it. We don't know how to drive this internally. So I got plenty of these requests and requirements and then I decided to stop Childress. It's about six months now. That's an

S Speaker 24:57interesting journey. And then you you know, you had sounds like a very interesting life. as well. Moving on all these beautiful countries.

S Speaker 25:15So so right now you're located in Singapore.
S Speaker 15:19Yeah, between Singapore and Malaysia. So So that's, that's how I spend my time. Sometimes I was also around when I was in Saudi Arabia was in February because we have a big client in Saudi Arabia. They're in the real estate backed by theif pension funds, so they're massive. And then the reality is that this particular design they started to build something that they show themselves because they have the resources to do so. But then when I went there, and I saw what they built in about six, eight months with eight people, it was a disaster. They couldn't build something you know, that actually get the right ground source. It was super slow. And they realized that that was not their core expertise, building an AI product, even an intermediate product. So that's why also we got to work together and you know what, when something besides it was okay. The rest is what to work with someone else. Not building something that gets outdated very quickly, especially in AI these days where things get moving all the time and changing and evolving, implementing your own solution for this enterprise. You know, we tend to invest heavily in things that get outdated very quickly. Yeah,
Yeah, between Singapore and Malaysia. So So that's, that's how I spend my time. Sometimes I was also around when I was in Saudi Arabia was in February because we have a big client in Saudi Arabia.

S Speaker 26:27I agree with you, even if you already have a bunch of customers.
I agree with you, even if you already have a bunch of customers.
I agree with you, even if you already have a bunch of customers.
I agree with you, even if you already have a bunch of customers.
S Speaker 16:33There are about six pilots converting them to your customers, and it's about about 25 in the pipeline. We are trying to you know, we the team is quite stretched to be honest with you. So that's why we're putting this strong together. So that is the scale a little bit the team so we can cope with the demand and expand as well because there is demand globally, as I said, of course a bunch of clients in this region, but in the US and Canada in the Middle East, we're seeing this and even in LA Tom, I was approached by people in town. So yeah, we'll say

S Speaker 27:09you know, then and then on prem, I'm guessing do you I mean, you deploy and customers on prem, they, they they have their own GPUs, I'm assuming today like
you know, then and then on prem, I'm guessing do you I mean, you deploy and customers on prem, they, they they have their own GPUs, I'm assuming today like

S Speaker 19:59also why you know, I were racing this was more around from senior season as well in this particular sectors that I mentioned, because there is a you know, synergy element to it. They also have interest from the LPs and, you know, corporate clients and partners. So one to explore this furniture to want to give the product to them, and we want to also keep improving the product and the feedback. So I think that's very important for us. I also have a number of receipts and people that I've worked with in the past because of our previous companies. But I already know what they will say I want us to validate even further the product and the business. But by working with this, like minded partners and this CVC setting, you know we can get there I'm partner to distributor and in turn solution that we were selling and in different segments, right so that's how we're thinking about it. That's how we're executed.

S Speaker 210:50That's good. I think that's a rich strategy.
S Speaker 110:58Let's see, I think, you know, what we've seen in the market is still particularly in this region, where there is a gap of funding every state should feel is split up in the cyber world. They spend a lot of money. I think the solution is just to work with those that are ready to commit and to do it because they have a mandate as well to bring innovative solutions to these departments. Right. So yeah,
Let's see, I think, you know, what we've seen in the market is still particularly in this region, where there is a gap of funding every state should feel is split up in the cyber world.

S Speaker 211:24okay, so that's good to know. Yeah, see the space of enterprise AI Enterprise Search generation summarization gas is getting as you know, it's getting very, very crowded. And then I agree, something that you said definitely resonated with me which is it's about land. It's a land grab, which is you can go as fast as possible if you can let the market in my opinion is also huge. Because, you know, like so well funded companies in the US, there's enough market for them to go fight it out in the US and then there's lots of opportunities in rest of the world, as well and an envy company, which company doesn't need a smarter search and smarter subsidization?
okay, so that's good to know. Yeah, see the space of enterprise AI Enterprise Search generation summarization gas is getting as you know, it's getting very, very crowded.

S Speaker 112:18In my experience, I mean, when I was talking to startups and companies, that will be always competitors, and that's actually good validation. Sometimes, you know, maybe from an investor perspective, you want to beat the horse want to win the steam and whatnot. But to me markets are ever expanding. So so that zero sum game. However, there is the situation where you have to move faster to capture some clients and also bring value to the business and will have to evolve the problem in certain directions. So that's how I think about it. The fact that their companies are doing this for many years, so some new comers so maybe more vertical platforms serving for particular, I will say use cases. That's great. And I think we're all trying to find you know, from our defeat and whatnot, but the demand and the feedback that we get from our existing clients and public in some way engaged is pretty strong, and they're all concerned about data privacy. They're all concerned about compliance and latest working tea and you know, a lot of issues that maybe other companies overlook, and you know, focus is to really sorry for what they actually mean, which is just a businessman concerns. And then from there move towards automation, but not imposing workflow. dimension or an assistant or an agent, because we think that they want that. We want to first build infrastructure, bring all the data together, and then government orders data, privacy, data, serenity, and whatnot, and just hear from them.

So that's how I think about it. The fact that their companies are doing this for many years, so some new comers so maybe more vertical platforms serving for particular, I will say use cases. That's great. And I think we're all trying to find you know, from our defeat and whatnot, but the demand and the feedback that we get from our existing clients and public in some way engaged is pretty strong, and they're all concerned about data privacy. They're all concerned about compliance and latest working tea and you know, a lot of issues that maybe other companies overlook, and you know, focus is to really sorry for what they actually mean, which is just a businessman concerns. And then from there move towards automation, but not imposing workflow. dimension or an assistant or an agent, because we think that they want that. We want to first build infrastructure, bring all the data together, and then government orders data, privacy, data, serenity, and whatnot, and just hear from them.
S Speaker 113:4912 Both. Okay, yeah, I like to clean I like clean teams, and we need to hire a few people more in engineering product, but I prefer leaner teams because we can execute faster and yeah, and they will come with opinions. Anyways, okay.

S Speaker 114:11sounds like the thing is good labor people that we know people that I know how they work and how they, you know, the quality of the work. And it's cheaper than in other countries as well. So yeah, that gives us a bit of a competitive advantage and better margins and

S Speaker 115:07that's also why so sometimes because it seems that once you've connected to all your systems, then it's really hard to remove the laser because if everyone is using it, and then you know, there is another interesting insight on learning. For example, we engage his huge real estate company hidden satisfaction. So they're already using all the soup from Microsoft. They're thinking of paying co pilots for everyone in the company. Okay. And they also censored so that I think, you know, paying for Einstein, the co founder of Salesforce, however, that costs about 60 bucks per seat, okay. pricing point for a company in Southeast Asia is Sanogo. No, no.

S Speaker 215:46So that's $60 per seat per month. Yes,
S Speaker 115:50only to use Feinstein and Microsoft co pilot, okay. Yes, but the issue there is that these compilers are not talking to each other. Yes. So, the information is across different silos. This is split. So, you know, I met them at the office and you know, the CIO and the CFO. And then look, we have your solution where we put all the data together. And we basically let this database talk to each other. Because query you can use any of them there is some restriction in terms of the number of queries, you can run out the search console the entire company, and it will not cost you 60 bucks per se. So they are really fun to go for providers to know more for instance, and to purchase a product for sudden for 20 bucks, proceeds

S Speaker 116:45Caching, caching most of the time recording, so don't go into the names most of the time, because the moment that you keep using the system with all your data, the generated information also goes back into your knowledge base. So where people is coming in and doing stuff, most of them, they come this comes from the cache, it doesn't go to them so wherever the Manage comes in that way, interesting. Interesting. That so we sent me something with seven requests. Because we don't have an index, and this was already generated by your colleague with four children.

S Speaker 117:41Absolutely. Let me show the deck after the call and then we'll take it from there you know, happy to talk to the team over here and explore any any synergies and whatnot. I think for us, like I said, this work button to work with the right partners. The fact that you mentioned end to end solution, I think that actually, for sure, you know, clients are going to love that because otherwise if we bring the software then they have to figure out the hardware, right. So if we purchase a solution in a way that makes sense to them, good pricing point. You know, I think the ideal scenario for them and for everyone, I did have a win win win.
