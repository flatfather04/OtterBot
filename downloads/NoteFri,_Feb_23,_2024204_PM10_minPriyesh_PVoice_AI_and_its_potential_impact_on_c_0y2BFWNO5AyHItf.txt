S Speaker 10:00Okay, so in part one we covered what you don't really take live to the world of consumer and games. He was a good example is voice finally having its moment and foundational models or UX wins from the AI battlegrounds? Listen to me.

Please note the a16z and its affiliates may also maintain investments in companies discussed in this video. For more details, including a link to our investments, please see ASICs unsettle comm slash disclosures. First up, after over a decade of heavy investment for large language models, finally the unlock that we needed for voice first apps and if so, what will this shifting interaction modality mean? For both new and existing products?

S Speaker 20:54Prime Minister Acharya I'm a GP on our consumer investing team, looking at all things AI apps. My big idea for this year is that voice will actually be a new sort of emerging way to interact with technology and at the heart of a new set of productivity apps. So the theory here is that voice is the way that humans have communicated with each other since really the day the communication was born. But voice has never really worked as an interface for technology. And I think one of the reasons for that is that when you interact with a product using voice, you sort of have the unconscious expectations that you would have of a human. So you're expected to actually be pretty flexible, cognitively sophisticated. And really be able to interact with you. And most of the systems that exist today or at least have historically existed are very inflexible. There's just these sort of logic trees and if you don't navigate them perfectly, then they just don't work. And we've all experienced that with Alexa and some of the past generation voice assistants. So I think the go forward idea is that AI and large models really unlock humans ability to interact with technology. I think the other thing that's very interesting for productivity apps is that you can imagine some of the incumbent productivity providers, Gmail for email, for example. They're going to build a lot of the obvious AI features for those apps and experiences but it's less obvious that they would prioritize something that's voice first because it requires you rethinking the entire experience from the ground up. So I really think it's an interesting area because it has previously never worked. And now this technology allows it to work and it's not something that the incumbents are obviously going to build. So that's what I expect to see hope to see and invest in in 2024.

S Speaker 12:16All right, so I feel like that sounds really exciting. But voice has been pending for quite some time. You addressed this a little bit, but I actually went back I looked up the Gartner Hype Cycle over the last decade, speech recognition popped up in 2010. And that was actually in the plateau of productivity. And yet despite a lot of investment from a lot of big companies, we're talking Amazon, Google Apple feels like we're still waiting. And you address that maybe there's some new technology on the horizon. But what would you say has been the limiting factor thus far,

S Speaker 22:42I mean, simply that the old technology architecture doesn't allow you to get to the level of fidelity that you need. So if you look at it, kind of the last 10% is where 99% of the effort goes and this is true of a lot of AI problems that were built on the old architecture. So you know self driving is a great example of this true interactive voice is a great example of this. You can get to 90% you just can't get to 99%. And this technology really lets you get to 99%. And you can see that if you've interacted with chat GBT via voice, it's very compelling. If you use 11 Labs, I mean, their work is very compelling. So it's clear that this now works. And really what we needed was a technology shifts, not a sort of set of like financial resources that incumbents have historically provided to make this work. Yeah,

S Speaker 13:17and you mentioned that existing apps aren't necessarily equipped to build these experiences. Maybe you could just elaborate on that. And maybe also think through what would a voice first app even look like?
and you mentioned that existing apps aren't necessarily equipped to build these experiences. Maybe you could just elaborate on that. And maybe also think through what would a voice first app even look like?

and you mentioned that existing apps aren't necessarily equipped to build these experiences. Maybe you could just elaborate on that. And maybe also think through what would a voice first app even look like?
S Speaker 23:28So first, existing apps are built with a set of existing workflows. And anytime into doesn't set a workflow, you have to think about how that affects all of the existing users. I'm sure there's very hard for them to go to a dramatically different paradigm like a superhuman. And of course, we will try this with inbox and ended up shutting it down. But there's a set of consumer expectations and a huge audience that just expect the product to work a certain way. And to do something like a voice first inbox, for example. You're just going to need a completely different set of workflows. So if Google does decide to do that, they're going to have to start from scratch along with everyone else. So it's not obvious to me that an incumbent will build this in terms of what the experience would look like. A great example is a lot of executives that I know when they're driving into work in the morning, they'll phone their executive assistant, and they'll say, Hey, let's go through my inbox together. Let's talk about what seems like it's a priority. What seems like it's important but not urgent, what's purely spam? What are internal versus external asks, and they will together sort of prioritize so that when that executive arrives, they're sort of ready to go with everything they need to do. So an experience like that, I think would make enormous sense except now it's available to everyone, not just executives who have a dedicated assistant. Yeah,

S Speaker 14:29definitely. And you mentioned two specific areas that you're looking to in 2024, including companionship and productivity. Here's to know what you're already seeing built there. Are you already seeing builders great apps that are live and working in our voice first? Yeah,

S Speaker 24:42there's a lot of cool exploration that's happening in the voice space. So one of the ones that I'm the biggest fan of is a product called tab. So Tom has gotten a bunch of heat online. And it's a very interesting found a very interesting product idea where it's a pendant that you wear that sort of passively captures your conversations throughout the day. And then it allows you to interact with all that context and ask questions, ask it to summarize. So it's a great example of someone who's really thinking about this from a first principles perspective, a voice perspective. The second most interesting product outside of something like 11 is actually just chat TPTs voice module and their voice sort of interface. So I encourage everyone to go take a walk and just have a chat with chat GPT and you'll be amazed at how quickly you sort of forget that you're talking to an AI and you fall into the flow of the conversations I'd say between tab GPT. And certainly what the team at 11 is doing. There's a lot of cool stuff to check out.

S Speaker 15:29Yeah, and as this tech gets better, I think what I'd love to hear your perspective on is really like the unexpected type of experiences that right now don't seem obvious, but I mean, I think it's easy for people to imagine. Oh yeah, I can send an email Oh, yeah, I can start a song with my Alexa. But if we're really talking something foundational, where voice becomes the primary potential modality for interacting with some of these applications, what might we imagine to be on the horizon that's a little more significant than what we imagine with voice today. I
Yeah, and as this tech gets better, I think what I'd love to hear your perspective on is really like the unexpected type of experiences that right now don't seem obvious, but I mean, I think it's easy for people to imagine.

I
S Speaker 25:58mean, it's trite to say this, but I will anyway, which is simply the movie her. Like, that's it, which is a passive sort of experience that has all the contexts that you have, where voice is the primary modality of interaction and then you can fall back to the screen if and when needed. So if we look back in 10 years, and that's the way that we interact with technology, it won't feel like such a really,
mean, it's trite to say this, but I will anyway, which is simply the movie her.

S Speaker 16:15I think important question then is that currently is not the primary modality. And so you have all of these companies who really rely on a website or an app or graphical user interface, which may become moot if we really are moving in that direction. I mean, curious to know your perspective there on how builders should be thinking about that potential paradigm if it really is voice first, like how do existing companies integrate this thoughtfully?

I
S Speaker 26:39don't know if it is moot. I think that there's room for both. There's a lot more technology penetration to be had. So if you're a developer, and you work in an IDE, you're probably faster hands on keyboard with screen then you're going to be with voice, at least for now. And maybe the answer is combination of the two. So I think that there is a lot of room for existing products and existing sort of modalities for interaction. On the other hand, if you're maybe a senior citizen, that you simply I mean, maybe you're interacting with technology, but you're really struggling with it. And this unlocks every product for you, potentially. So I think it's a market expansion, positive story, not a zero sum story. But I tend to always think that so

S Speaker 17:11yeah, no, I agree. I think it's positive sum. But how would you for example, if you were an application that does not have a voice first interaction mode, should all builders be thinking about that incorporation? Or how would you think about that if you're an existing builder, without this on your roadmap?
yeah, no, I agree. I think it's positive sum.

S Speaker 27:25I think the customer and sort of interaction pattern is so different than if I had an existing product, I would probably focus on playing from my place of advantage, which is non voice workflows, rather than trying to rethink my product from the ground up around this and look, the extra maybe in the middle where there actually are some workflows that are voice enabled that extend the existing workflow. But again, I think this is a sort of like a market expansion, that new customer story rather than someone taking existing. Yeah.

S Speaker 28:03you have to retrain people they need to know how to interact with these systems. And by default, their expectations are going to be very high, it's going to be like, Look, I should be able to interact with this in exactly the same level of fidelity and responsiveness and sort of flexibility that I can with a human. So if that's not what you're able to offer or what you intend to offer, then it will require certain training your customers interact with you in the right way. So do you think that there's an onboarding question? And then look, I think there's also a just sort of a social patterns question. Where is it going to be socially acceptable to be sort of talking into thin air now, arguably, people are already doing that with their sort of Bluetooth and air pods and so on, and it will all change quickly together as a society, but I think there'll be some period of time for which the early adopters are gonna feel a little crazy or that they look that way.

S Speaker 18:44You know, it's so funny. You mentioned that my husband's grandmother said, the first time she ever heard someone talking on a cell phone, she thought they were crazy, because they were doing it in the supermarket. And she was like, why are they talking to themselves? So maybe there's an element of that now again, to rumblings out, seems like there's a lot of opportunity on the table, we're talking about a potential change in interaction modality. If you're an entrepreneur, how would you even think about starting what would you look at? Tell me a little bit more about where you would begin? Obviously,

S Speaker 29:10it's tautological, but you can only begin at the beginning. I think it's impossible to infer what the end product is going to look like. And you've just got to start building so I think I would try to build something useful and interesting. And just iterate from there. That's it. Look, I think the other thing that's interesting here is that some of these technologies, if you're too pointed at the beginning, in terms of product design, then it can constrain you. I think that if you introduce the capability in an intelligent way, your customers will pull you in a direction. I think some of the best product builders I've seen have been willing to try to offer the capability in a way that is relatively neutral and allow the customers that yeah,

S Speaker 19:43and per your advice earlier for people to play around with this tech themselves and to use voice more. Always just using products just use the products. Awesome. Well, this has been fascinating, and I cannot wait to use your voice in the technologies we use daily. So thank you so much for sharing destiny.
