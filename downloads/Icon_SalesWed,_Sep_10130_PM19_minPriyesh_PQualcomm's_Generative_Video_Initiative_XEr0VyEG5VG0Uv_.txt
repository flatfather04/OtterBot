something you've experimented with in any way?
S Speaker 15:07So sorry. We are currently very much in, I would say, the scoping stage for something like this. And I don't really understand how this could look like for us, right? UGC content is definitely one of the areas that I feel we can expand into specially converting, say, long form blogs into small, short form, UGC style content, and then using that to promote the fund itself. I've seen red point ventures do that quite a lot, and they're getting a lot of traction because of that. So I haven't experimented that, but that's like the first idea and the only idea that is on my mind today.

S Speaker 37:11Okay, yeah, honestly, I think the AI like, as far as, like, what's low hanging fruit, where there's some opportunities for us to, like, get some easy wins together, I would say that the AI consumer applications is going to be like number one on that list. Number two will be like your AI, B to B firms, and then from there, you know, we can kind of expand this. We find, you know, different things work. As far as what I might recommend here, I'd say, if like, the goal is to like, for this to be a little bit more hands off for like, both the portfolio companies and for yourselves, I would recommend what I recommended earlier, which is to do more of like the managed service, rather than to do the self serve application. You could think of it as, like, we're building a creative layer on top of the business that is your Play function for us to like, think about it like Harvey AI, like Harvey, like, sat next to legal associates for like, three years, basically just like they were, like, forward deploy engineers, rebuilding the entire kind of legal stack. We're effectively doing the same thing, except for it's just, you know, performance creative is kind of the first place that we're starting. And then we'll obviously, like, expand out into like, organic creative, into, you know, like CRO like the entire kind of, again, the entire kind of creative stuff. And so we've got a team of we acquired an agency, we brought them internally. We've got a head of creative, head of creative ops, we've got a head of UGC, we've got a head of paid media. We've got about 20 static designers internally that use the icon software to produce static ads. And then, you know, they do all of the editing themselves. And you like, find tweaking to make sure that it looks good. And then it's obviously like, you know, engineered for performance. And then on the UGC side, we've got a large team of editors as well that we basically have the UBC creators make the content. We ship it to us. We edit everything. On the back end, you would have the opportunity to review and revise everything. We do unlimited revisions on our end. So as revisions come through for either your team or the portfolio companies, we will just do those revisions. They're completely unlimited. And yeah, that's kind of how it works. It's actually a lot faster for software as well, because we don't have to, like, ship anything to them. They can also do screen recordings on their laptops, on their phones, anything that we need to have them do there, just to make sure that we're really telling the best story possible and showcasing the brand in a good way. And yeah, I mean, we can make it like pretty turnkey, interesting.
Okay, yeah, honestly, I think the AI like, as far as, like, what's low hanging fruit, where there's some opportunities for us to, like, get some easy wins together, I would say that the AI consumer applications is going to be like number one on that list.

S Speaker 19:37So, so would it be fair for me to assume the managed service provider, say, as an AI native agency that works under icon? And if so, given that you have acquired an agency and you have actual people working on it, I believe the content would be more production ready from from start or. Up. But what's the benefit? For say, Me tying up with icons AI, native service agency versus another plain straight out marketing agency, something like

S Speaker 310:13that, cost, tech enablement, and really, like the additional things. So, like, we the additional things, meaning, like, okay, so, like a traditional UGC agency, you will probably go through this. If you go through another UGC agency, more often than not, they like to gatekeep the final raw assets. So like they will hand you the fully edited file, but trying to get them to give you the raw files that were used to make that final asset, very unlikely that they're going to give them to you without asking you to pay in icon. Those are your files. You own them outright. Beyond that, you know, because it's, you know, somewhat of a tech enabled service. You know, that's what allows us to charge lower prices than anyone else does. It allows us to provide unlimited provisions, and it allows us to just scale into the account much faster than like a traditional kind of agency model would. And for us, just to give you a little bit of context on like, the business model is that we see this as like a creative services layer, that the entire intent and purpose is that every single time like, it's a forcing function for our team to build the absolute best, most efficient tacking system that we possibly can and as we do so, we are going to surface each of these layers, layer by layer to self serve customers. So like, there are things we're doing right now, like, think of like for like a digital, like a direct consumer brand. There is sourcing creators. There is shipping product to those creators. There is getting that footage back, there's putting all that footage together and editing all four of those things. We can apply a ton of tech to to make auto recommendations for creators, to automatically ship product to creators when they're selected to when we get the footage back. We can, like, pre edit it with AI, and then from there, maybe, like, a video editor is maybe today, they're spending 20 minutes editing a video, or maybe in two to three weeks, they're spending five minutes editing a video now where a traditional another agency might say, okay, that's 4x the margin on a video editor that we can take on. We see that as we can provide 4x the number of assets. And so it's just, how do we take what is the value that's traditionally captured into margin and instead drive more value to customers? And that's really like how we'll start to build, like, a real long term
that, cost, tech enablement, and really, like the additional things. So, like, we the additional things, meaning, like, okay, so, like a traditional UGC agency, you will probably go through this. If you go through another UGC agency, more often than not, they like to gatekeep the final raw assets.

S Speaker 313:41possibly Yes, I will. I mean, I'm not as familiar with the cool but what I will say is that, I mean, this is from working with almost 3000 brands at icon right now, we're finding that the bar for quality is a lot higher than these AI models are able to produce. And so that's really where, you know, our goal is not just to lower the cost of creative. Our goal is also to lower the cost of creative while maintaining this particular bar for quality and bar for performance. And we're just finding that most AI created video assets just are not performing inside of ad
possibly Yes, I will.

S Speaker 114:16accounts. That makes sense, and like a couple of questions. Say you use AI models to generate assets, and apart from one model that I know of, all of them have been trained on internet wide data. How does ownership IP? Who has the rights to some of these IPs? Can we use as Qualcomm enters use that asset as our own?

S Speaker 314:43Yes. So that asset is your asset to use. It does not get input into any like training data. Since most of the assets themselves are actually like human produced, we're not like generating the assets with AI. Now, as far as like, the static imagery, static imagery. We're building static ads through nanovanna, plus our kind of, like, what do you want to call it, like, context layer. And so I'm unsure of the way that the API is structured with Nana banana, if that's like, if all of those queries are included as part of training data, I don't know. I know that we had structured it with chatgpt, that they weren't for the the image in with chatgpt, but I'm unsure. On the Nana banana one we just migrated over in the last couple of days.
