S Speaker 10:31And I wonder if pendulum, you know, like, for example, if I look at the coding space, people went from okay, you know what? We don't need to build our own models. We're going to cursor and, you know, windsurf and all these companies, they started saying, Okay, we're going to just use Cloud and OpenAI. And then now they're saying, Okay, this is essentially an RL layer, and then the intelligence layer as commodity. We can build our own model because we understand the user actions and then pendulum swinging back into Okay, I'm going to go build my own model in that space in order to have a better

S Speaker 21:14control, yeah. And I think, you know, video is a little bit different, because, you know, standard diffusion models are pretty well understood in terms of, you know, for images, it's very well understood, yeah, I would say for video, it's a little bit more challenging, because it is really the application of physics, frame over frame. And we think at least where we have spent the most amount of time is post training to to get visual accuracy out of the models, but also finding that there is no one size fits all right, like we, we have eight models that we that we operate ourselves. And then there's, I think, seven others that were API integrated, that are closed source models, yeah. And they all have their strengths and weaknesses. You know, like now banana is, it's very fast,
control, yeah. And I think, you know, video is a little bit different, because, you know, standard diffusion models are pretty well understood in terms of, you know, for images, it's very well understood, yeah, I would say for video, it's a little bit more challenging, because it is really the application of physics, frame over frame.

like, high resolution, yeah, it's very limited. While vo three is really good at high resolution, but it's also, it's about $37 per second a video,

2:41is that, right? Well,
is that, right? Well,
is that, right? Well,
is that, right? Well,
S Speaker 22:43so, you know, it works in in certain situations, but like, even for ad production, you know, company, if that were the only alternative, they might still prefer to shoot video because it's it's cheaper, so, but I can talk to this a little bit about, you know, where we differentiated ourselves and where we think we have, like an enduring mode for the Business. Okay, so, first and foremost, I think, in comparison to companies like runway and Luma, we are very much short form video focused. We are not going after Hollywood. We're not, you know, like the state of the art in producing like 8k video for a two hour movie will cost considerably more than what Pixar and, you know, LucasArts spends today on building that. So our view is that, you know, the market, like when we think about what we have in what we've had in market is really this very easy use, high fidelity engine for social media and social media ads. But what we aspire to do is to take what we call our video reasoning engine that's really optimized for overcoming social media blindness and driving engagement and conversion, because this is what our customers want. This is what they demand. So when we think about the the addressable market you've got, you know, if you just look at social media content creation. You know, of course, Google, YouTube, Tiktok, have a, have a completely captive environment there, but it's a huge market. So like, when we think about the coding space, it's about a sixth of that, right? Like, if you look at the entire ecosystem for coding, including, like code production, managing third party tools and third party teams. This is a much bigger market. And if you look at just the tool space of that today, and you look at the Adobe's all the post production tools, including from Apple and Microsoft, figma, Canva. That's a $40 billion market today. And we think What's disruptable, really addressable is half that
so, you know, it works in in certain situations, but like, even for ad production, you know, company, if that were the only alternative, they might still prefer to shoot video because it's it's cheaper, so, but I can talk to this a little bit about, you know, where we differentiated ourselves and where we think we have, like an enduring mode for the Business.

S Speaker 25:55Well, yeah, if you look at the SAM that's how much they're spending, right? Like, Adobe's revenues, like $26 billion yeah? And it's all sort of in this. I mean, yes, they have corporate customers, but it's a tiny slice of
Well, yeah, if you look at the SAM that's how much they're spending, right? Like, Adobe's revenues, like $26 billion yeah? And it's all sort of in this. I mean, yes, they have corporate customers, but it's a tiny slice of

S Speaker 16:24are they acquiring, I haven't seen. I mean, they tried to acquire Canva that didn't go through. Why? I think

S Speaker 26:33they should probably try again. I mean, like they also tried to buy figma, and Figmas IPO is way north of would they tried to back figma or Ken Miller, both, both and FTC said no to both of them. Wow. But today, I doubt if the Trump driven FTC is going to be interventionist. But you know, Adobe's continuously in their history, they've grown through big acquisitions, and as much as like Firefly is an interesting add on to Photoshop, like their answer for video just doesn't exist.

S Speaker 17:17I don't I think what Adobe, still in the near future has is distribution with enterprise and then, but they have to act like, they have to like, act almost like how Google eventually acted, and then now it feels like together,
I don't I think what Adobe, still in the near future has is distribution with enterprise and then, but they have to act like, they have to like, act almost like how Google eventually acted, and then now it feels like together,

S Speaker 27:36yeah. I mean, markets not crazy about right? Like the stock isn't, hasn't been doing that well. And I think it's a reflection of, even if, because Canada's been talking a little bit more publicly, I think they're probably trying to go public next $3.3 billion your business, right? And they stole that entire market from Photoshop. So I think Photoshop light on a standalone basis is still bigger, but the growth, okay, so here's how we look at the competition, yeah. So we don't put like agent there. I'm sorry. We do have agent. We don't put, I runway there, because we think it's a completely different market. But the two dimensions that we really
yeah. I mean, markets not crazy about right? Like the stock isn't, hasn't been doing that well. And I think it's a reflection of, even if, because Canada's been talking a little bit more publicly, I think they're probably trying to go public next $3.3 billion your business, right?

S Speaker 18:30why do you say that? Because, I mean, they can go for a short form video content as well, runway and Luma can go for short form. Yeah.
why do you say that? Because, I mean, they can go for a short form video content as well, runway and Luma can go for short form. Yeah.
why do you say that? Because, I mean, they can go for a short form video content as well, runway and Luma can go for short form. Yeah.
why do you say that? Because, I mean, they can go for a short form video content as well, runway and Luma can go for short form. Yeah.
S Speaker 28:39So let's start with the easy one, Luma, almost no traction in the market. Right? Hats off. They went to the Gulf. They raised a lot of money. But like all the VCs on Sand Hill basically said, Look, how are you going to differentiate? And they didn't have a story today. In terms of market like market presence, revenue there, they've got an incredible war chest, but nothing more than that. Runway, you know, runways strategy was, you know, let's go sign exclusive contracts. Did that Luma round even happen? Yeah, the one yet last year,
So let's start with the easy one, Luma, almost no traction in the market. Right? Hats off. They went to the Gulf. They raised a lot of money. But like all the VCs on Sand Hill basically said, Look, how are you going to differentiate? And they didn't have a story today.

S Speaker 19:23last quarter, last quarter, right? Last quarter. Yeah, it wasn't like the last year. One never happened the last year when we get got dragged out through like last quarter or something. But I know that if you go to humane website, they have like, Grog and Luma over there.
last quarter, last quarter, right? Last quarter. Yeah, it wasn't like the last year. One never happened the last year when we get got dragged out through like last quarter or something. But I know that if you go to humane website, they have like, Grog and Luma over there.

S Speaker 110:33From a tech perspective, they can also go for short for video content, right?

From a tech perspective, they can also go for short for video content, right?
From a tech perspective, they can also go for short for video content, right?
S Speaker 210:37They could. Yeah, I think that. So we just hired someone that's a refugee from from runway. And the problem with runway is runway went in to Hollywood and basically signed a bunch of exclusive deals, but they can't. They're now not unable to produce content at the pace like so the first big thing is Lionsgate, like Lionsgate, is using our platform for After Effects. It's not, I mean, we're not trying to build movies from scratch, but the stuff that they have tried,
They could. Yeah, I think that. So we just hired someone that's a refugee from from runway.

S Speaker 211:48And I still think that, like, if you look at the researchers, I mean, to to Luma is credit, they actually have a pretty good bank of researchers, like people that have published that do interesting things, they just haven't been able to parlay that into a product. And so look, there's no question that if OpenAI got really serious about the space, they could go by someone and accelerate that. But at the same time, I think video and visual reasoning is quite different from like core transformer LLM

S Speaker 112:39research. So essentially, you still think that, like the hayjins of the world, I don't know now, but the hayjins of the world, they're not even saying that I want to go build that team. See what I'm saying. Like, I don't even want to build that team. Captions, I believe now, because they've raised so much money, are now building models, their own models. That's what I remember. I read recently that they're

S Speaker 215:10Just, just think of it this way, right? The two dimensions is ease of use, yeah, drag and drop, point and click, like we, like one of our customers actually coined it, which is click to video. It's not starting your experience with a prompt box. And then, you know, trying to do prompt engineering, you cannot go get the 27 million people that pay $30 a month to Canva. With that user experience, it's got to be click.

And, and then, then what's
And, and then, then what's
S Speaker 215:51the x axis is visual accuracy, which is accuracy, yes, so, and this is no variations, visual coherence and and the number of iterations it takes like that level of accuracy, we have almost a 70% download rate of videos generated on our platform, yeah, which really speaks to they're not having to go through a ton of iterations before they get something useful.

S Speaker 216:49I think the monetization of something like open art is very challenging. Yeah, they were an early mover, and I think they got some traction that when we, when we look at them as a as someone that comes up in conversations, they never do okay

S Speaker 217:15You know, hey, Gen comes out in the sense that they like. Synthesia was the first company to really get traction with like avatars, hey Jen was kind of the next follow on. But for us, like our avatars are, are photorealistic, like you could not tell them from humans. Why? I think with Hey Jen, there's still that, you know that the laughter
You know, hey, Gen comes out in the sense that they like. Synthesia was the first company to really get traction with like avatars, hey Jen was kind of the next follow on.

S Speaker 117:43being able to give I looked at your avatar, I guess since these avatars also, I was looking at yesterday, wow, even there. I mean, their avatars weren't as good, maybe last year, last year, but now they're getting better, like human avatar, and then companies like Tavis are cool. So the avatar space also,
being able to give I looked at your avatar, I guess since these avatars also, I was looking at yesterday, wow, even there.

S Speaker 218:05yeah, but I think, I think that the issue with avatars is there's a couple of things. One is, how do you create character consistency? And like with Synthesia, they did it because there's a fixed number of, you know, sort of models and permutations. I think Hagen has tried to do a little bit more while ours, you know, you can, you can take a real human use that as reference, build your avatar on that, and and character consistency, from not just like frame to frame, but from, you know, different iterations of production, yeah, keeping that consistent. I think that's where we stand, okay, head and shoulders above. So there's a couple of things I wanted to showcase Yeah, on where we made the market, right? We were the first people to have these templates and presets for VFX. There's a lot of people that have tried to cut to copy that draw the video. The fact that you could upload something, you can scribble on it
yeah, but I think, I think that the issue with avatars is there's a couple of things. One is, how do you create character consistency?

19:20The furniture. Yeah.
S Speaker 219:23And then with soul and soul ID, it's this idea that you can extract the soul of an image and then apply that to what does that mean? It may be a style, but Well, it's capturing the soul of a scene, right? So objects in the scene, who's in it, and then being able to use that as reference for a building,
And then with soul and soul ID, it's this idea that you can extract the soul of an image and then apply that to what does that mean?

S Speaker 119:49like, is it generated? So it's a color to like,
like, is it generated? So it's a color to like,
like, is it generated? So it's a color to like,
like, is it generated? So it's a color to like,
19:55just the style, the
S Speaker 219:58filters, or no, it's actually the content itself, the vibe, yeah, yeah. It's kind of the vibe of it, yeah. But it's also, it's being able to build a full 3d model with whatever that you're sampling and and to be able to render that with very strong visual.
filters, or no, it's actually the content itself, the vibe, yeah, yeah. It's kind of the vibe of it, yeah. But it's also, it's being able to build a full 3d model with whatever that you're sampling and and to be able to render that with very strong visual.

S Speaker 120:22So this is I've got an image, and I say, take this image and then extract the soul of this and then apply it to another image, anything you wanted, or generate an image or apply it to another image that I have.
So this is I've got an image, and I say, take this image and then extract the soul of this and then apply it to another image, anything you wanted, or generate an image or apply it to another image that I have.
So this is I've got an image, and I say, take this image and then extract the soul of this and then apply it to another image, anything you wanted, or generate an image or apply it to another image that I have.
So this is I've got an image, and I say, take this image and then extract the soul of this and then apply it to another image, anything you wanted, or generate an image or apply it to another image that I have.
S Speaker 220:36Yeah, but probably the highest use case is taking a you know, a image, like a camera shot, and then be able to turn whatever object in that scene into full motion video. So it might be the person in the middle this so for some reason that the colors aren't right, but,
Yeah, but probably the highest use case is taking a you know, a image, like a camera shot, and then be able to turn whatever object in that scene into full motion video. So it might be the person in the middle this so for some reason that the colors aren't right, but,
