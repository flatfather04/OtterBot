S Speaker 10:09Okay, I just checked the pitch book. It's actually their valuation is not as I thought. It's supposed to 75,000,074 point 5 million. They raised 15 point 5 million. It's led by when we call and the Team Drive ventures.

S Speaker 11:20Oh, I'm so sorry. Yeah, good, good. I bring my colleagues to you today. Here is the Koha ventures North America head. He is an expert in our team. I often look at interesting ideas with them together. And Priyesh is our associate in the team as well. And Steven, as I mentioned to you, we actually look at a lot of AI video startups starting from last year. Remember last time we talked a while ago? And also checked out a lot of applications. And really want to engage with you. And of course, congratulations on your recent raising. Thanks. Yeah,

S Speaker 210:02And so on the ads creation today, which is the type of ads that you create? Is it focused on a particular category? Like for example, are you focused on ads with avatars, mostly, or ads in general, like which

S Speaker 410:25is started as the ad with avatar. That's our bread and butter. Like a lot of people think we have the best we do like for UTCs on the markets, but now we actually now expanding the format, right? We're increasing the creative diversity of our offering. So now you can create like a cinematic ads. You can create like a really dynamic visual type of ads, and very soon you can create image ads as well. So we really like expand our offering to

10:55under demand. And
S Speaker 210:59so today, for these for ads generation, do you use your own models, or do you happen to like they use, like VO, a combination of other models,

so today, for these for ads generation, do you use your own models, or do you happen to like they use, like VO, a combination of other models,
S Speaker 411:13the combination like, we built our open avatar model so we have like, one of the best avatar technology on the market that's purely in House prepared technology, but we also use like things like wheel three to generate, like some Bureau ads and different type of ads. It's a combination. So we are leveraging both the in house technology. We have an in house research team here in Mountain View, and we have about like 10 researchers here. Okay, got it

S Speaker 211:49from you know, which is, how do you see, like the market, like positioning? Because there's, there's many companies going after the AI ads market today, right? How do you position like, is there, in your mind, is there a differentiation with createify, let's say, versus something like on a cool or something like create or something so there's, there's a few different companies attacking the asthma market in different directions, and then on surface, if you take a look at, if I take a look at the product, it seems similar. But from your perspective, is that, like, do you, how do you plan to differentiate in that market?

S Speaker 412:37We don't see like, real competitor, to be honest, like, I do, or just paying, paying a service level, right? Like, for example, you can see Hicksville, they also have like ads, right? Everyone said they have as class, like as is very different. Like to just make your equation. There is the creative part. There is a performance part, right? No one is actually building all the data and the science behind the generation, because what make a good ass? You have to convert right? You have to actually deliver like, CPA, CTR, like. So we are the only team which have the both expertise of like the generation, AI generation, and also the advertising performance optimization. So we build like the biggest like app platforms and system for meta, for Tiktok, for Snapchat. We know exactly how it works, and we are doing this like end to end approach, like we are off by the performance. So it's not like about how who can create, like, a beautiful video that's not as right, like, so you can run together, right? Say, Who, which has performance. I don't see any player doing that.

S Speaker 213:47So you essentially, you have your own CTR, which is you measure,
So you essentially, you have your own CTR, which is you measure,
So you essentially, you have your own CTR, which is you measure,
So you essentially, you have your own CTR, which is you measure,
S Speaker 413:54like predictors, like everything around that. And we have data, and we have like, Android workflows, yeah, okay,
like predictors, like everything around that. And we have data, and we have like, Android workflows, yeah, okay,
like predictors, like everything around that. And we have data, and we have like, Android workflows, yeah, okay,
like predictors, like everything around that. And we have data, and we have like, Android workflows, yeah, okay,
S Speaker 414:25both, like some, some pros really want their own ideas, right? But all of kind of a header they want us to come up with everything.
both, like some, some pros really want their own ideas, right? But all of kind of a header they want us to come up with everything.
both, like some, some pros really want their own ideas, right? But all of kind of a header they want us to come up with everything.
both, like some, some pros really want their own ideas, right? But all of kind of a header they want us to come up with everything.
S Speaker 214:34Okay? So, and then they generate ad using your platform. And then after that, do you AB test for them? UAB test for them, and then you calculate the click through rate.
Okay? So, and then they generate ad using your platform. And then after that, do you AB test for them? UAB test for them, and then you calculate the click through rate.
Okay? So, and then they generate ad using your platform. And then after that, do you AB test for them? UAB test for them, and then you calculate the click through rate.
Okay? So, and then they generate ad using your platform. And then after that, do you AB test for them? UAB test for them, and then you calculate the click through rate.
S Speaker 415:19really the key is not about the generation. Part generation is part it's a risk to the bottom, like it's no one's gonna make a lot of money. Yeah. From I agree, yeah. So the key is to own the workflow. So own the performance orchestration layer, like, who can actually use the data to actually guide the generation and generate the high to
really the key is not about the generation. Part generation is part it's a risk to the bottom, like it's no one's gonna make a lot of money. Yeah. From I agree, yeah.

So the key is to own the workflow. So own the performance orchestration layer, like, who can actually use the data to actually guide the generation and generate the high to
S Speaker 215:44most performance. So, like, even I'm going to be like, like, fully transparent to you, and honest, which is how I'm thinking. So we've looked at this space. My concern, in general space is what, like you said, like, which is generating videos or generating ads is a race to the bottom, right now, even closing the loop, for example, the question that I have is, which is, okay, you can do AB testing. So in let's forget generative ads for a second. If you were just in traditional ads. There were so many platforms already doing CTR and, you know, figuring out through AB tests as to how your ads are performing. The only thing now is that you have an automated way to actually close the loop right, which like, I'm not saying, I'm just saying that's an obvious next step, right? If you ask any engineer any smarter, yeah, if you do with it, if you had this tool, that's the first idea that they were going to come Yeah, yes, exactly. So which is I'm going to close the loop, right? So I'm going to close the loop because I can automate this. I can automate how your ads are performing, and I'm going to take that feedback and and then put it back into this edge generation engine, right? Yeah, that's like, that's
most performance. So, like, even I'm going to be like, like, fully transparent to you, and honest, which is how I'm thinking. So we've looked at this space. My concern, in general space is what, like you said, like, which is generating videos or generating ads is a race to the bottom, right now, even closing the loop, for example, the question that I have is, which is, okay, you can do AB testing.

S Speaker 417:08like, I probably, I bet you probably hear the pitch like, 100 times before, right? So,
like, I probably, I bet you probably hear the pitch like, 100 times before, right? So,
like, I probably, I bet you probably hear the pitch like, 100 times before, right? So,
like, I probably, I bet you probably hear the pitch like, 100 times before, right? So,
S Speaker 217:14no, I'm not saying that's the pitch. I'm saying, if you were to just ask me on how I would design that would be the first idea that would come to my mind, right? Like, because it's just so obvious that this technology is there, you want to just close that group, it's, it's, and yes, of course, most companies will go. So my question then is, what, like, everybody is going to go, go do that, right? Like, that would be the first thing that would, that would then they would go do that. So then, you know, what we're we've been debating internally is like, how do you create a product that has low cost of switching,
no, I'm not saying that's the pitch. I'm saying, if you were to just ask me on how I would design that would be the first idea that would come to my mind, right? Like, because it's just so obvious that this technology is there, you want to just close that group, it's, it's, and yes, of course, most companies will go.

So then, you know, what we're we've been debating internally is like, how do you create a product that has low cost of switching,
S Speaker 217:58right now for many of the platforms, if everybody is going to sort of provide the same idea, then the key is going to be that you either you are providing a significantly better click through rate compared to any of the platforms. And if that's the case, then how do you do that? Right, like in an undifferentiated way? And that's what we want to understand, which is, is there? And the truth is, you know, we, I mean, I understand your hesitate. We never, like, we're Qualcomm, we, if a company, we, we have a very strong like the in general, like, we provide platforms to everybody in the world. Sharing

And I remember last year when I played, I need to paste a URL of the like a specific product, and then you generate ads. Right now. Do you have apps for like, both mobile and also desktop?
two years ago, yeah, I remember that, yeah. So I saw that, you know, in your website, the demo looks like it can be also displayed on the mobile.

S Speaker 126:45And, yeah, I remember last year when we chat, one distinguished point that in my, in my like I still remember today, is that you have the ads optimization platform that you know we

S Speaker 426:57also, I think also difference is like, we build our own technology. So, yeah, we have, like, we do our own kind of understanding, our own models, everything, like the house, right, tailor made for our use case where, clearly, it's just wrapper of other people's technology. I think they are really good at, like, templates, making templates, and
also, I think also difference is like, we build our own technology.

S Speaker 227:33would you be interested in working with Qualcomm to like, how do you see is there? Do you think there's an opportunity for you to actually run ads or generate ads on mobile platforms, and you think that device? Yeah, so
would you be interested in working with Qualcomm to like, how do you see is there? Do you think there's an opportunity for you to actually run ads or generate ads on mobile platforms, and you think that device? Yeah, so

S Speaker 428:01I think mobile is, it should be. I mean, mobile is, to us, is just an interface, like, the real heavy lifting is the backup technology, right? So I don't think it's, it's a problem to have, like the interface which allowed
I think mobile is, it should be. I mean, mobile is, to us, is just an interface, like, the real heavy lifting is the backup technology, right? So I don't think it's, it's a problem to have, like the interface which allowed

S Speaker 228:17interface, as in, would you be interested in generating ads like, run your model on more random model, how?

28:26And something we
S Speaker 428:28haven't, we haven't think about this, but if there is a strong business use case, we'll consider that.

What's the biggest like use case you can take off,
What's the biggest like use case you can take off,
28:43yeah, so typically,
S Speaker 228:46is to cost and vacancy. So which is, if you can generate on the mobile itself, then essentially you're not playing paying for cloud costs.

is to cost and vacancy. So which is, if you can generate on the mobile itself, then essentially you're not playing paying for cloud costs.
29:02And then second,
S Speaker 229:04in many cases, it will be much faster than generating the cloud. Now, if that is of value, like economic value to you, then only, then, I recommend it makes sense for you to actually run on mobile that is not of economic value to you, then it typically the overhead
in many cases, it will be much faster than generating the cloud. Now, if that is of value, like economic value to you, then only, then, I recommend it makes sense for you to actually run on mobile that is not of economic value to you, then it typically the overhead

S Speaker 229:32So that's where which is it's something, if it's something of a pain point to you today, you know if your users have to because I typically on any one of these platforms, I know for sure that over the years that whenever you can reduce the latency significantly, it significant drives up engagement heavily. But the quality doesn't have to be like the key is that the field needs to be the same quality. So that's the angle that we think that for sure,
So that's where which is it's something, if it's something of a pain point to you today, you know if your users have to because I typically on any one of these platforms, I know for sure that over the years that whenever you can reduce the latency significantly, it significant drives up engagement heavily.

S Speaker 230:10and and it's, it's something that, like, yeah, had the data on it, which is, you have the data on whether latency is a challenge for you today. Is cost a challenge for you
and and it's, it's something that, like, yeah, had the data on it, which is, you have the data on whether latency is a challenge for you today. Is cost a challenge for you

30:30Very interesting,
S Speaker 130:31yeah, maybe I can connect you with our PC team, because it's not just on mobile. We also have stepd neighborhood PC, but they will have, actually they're having currently working with a core right now. So there are a lot of use cases where the small model or the avatar model can run on PC. It's actually very interesting. There is a lot of go to market potential here with Qualcomm's beauty. So I'm happy to make the connection right here.
