S Speaker 20:55And I'm founder of Hightower robotics, and let me introduce our family to you. This is min Pai, and that is pan. Plus you maybe wonder why the name of the robot is min Pai, because you can see the shape look like the Carrick pan. So this main path, and after the presentation, you will understand why the other robots. Name is Pep pass. Sorry, where there's no screen, okay,

S Speaker 21:47our company, we have a very specific vision, Building a robot, not a machine that you put anything in the factory far away, but we want to set up a lively robot with personalities and also warmth in Our lives. So we make the cute, small robots, and at least I should thank modern because we, because he organizing the summit here. We gathering in this building, the history the Computer History Museum. And you know, 50 years ago, when the computer goes smaller and accessible, the developer, the developer can develop more and more useful things. So we can use a computer everywhere. And I think we live in a moment of history. This is the moment of PC time, robotics,

3:24yes, so we call this robotics, the desktop,
yes, so we call this robotics, the desktop,
yes, so we call this robotics, the desktop,
yes, so we call this robotics, the desktop,
S Speaker 23:29the desktop robot. And we have another character, another word in the description is character, robot. I will get to it later. So we are in the period of non intelligent to narrow intelligence. And at this period, the robot is not really smart with no real intelligence. So it is much more than as a development platform for developers and researchers. So our platform provide automated, ultimately efficiency, to developers. You can take the robot anywhere at home and office beside you. And also you can take you can even take it onto plan, yes. So come to the next page. Next page, next page, okay, yes, automated efficiency. And you can see the both format, very small and we can operate the main pair on the desk. Yes, and yeah, this is why we call that robot, pipe loss,
the desktop robot. And we have another character, another word in the description is character, robot. I will get to it later. So we are in the period of non intelligent to narrow intelligence.

S Speaker 25:11I think everyone have met the robot from yesterday. Do you like the robot? Oh, thank you, and they love you too. Yes, our robot is not a toy. Patron is not a toy. It's a mini piece, next page, the next page. No, next page, the next page, the next all the privilege,

6:14Ross, are you here?
S Speaker 26:18Yeah, I think maybe someone okay. And maybe pen asked to take a word to him, you are in danger, and the pen is looking for you, and also his brothers, not only pen plus, but all the robots all over the world, yeah. But in the future, our robot is not only a development platform, as I said, just know we need a robot. Have a personality and warm, warm and produce community in our very family. So we not only provide the capability to developers, we also provide character abilities. So this is
Yeah, I think maybe someone okay. And maybe pen asked to take a word to him, you are in danger, and the pen is looking for you, and also his brothers, not only pen plus, but all the robots all over the world, yeah.

S Speaker 29:35Yes, all of this is powered by the best complex computers at the very beginning. Five years ago, we start up the we start the hydro company. We want to build small, compact robots, but we can't get good enough small architecture, so we only, we have the only way to make it by ourselves. So we have the best compact architectures now, and you see the all kinds of the most kind of our architecture,
Yes, all of this is powered by the best complex computers at the very beginning. Five years ago, we start up the we start the hydro company.

S Speaker 217:24Hi, I've worked with some of these companies in the EdTech space before, who designed robots and curriculum you're trying to do? The standard challenge becomes that, at least for educational in the educational setting, kids get bored pretty quickly, like they like to play with these robots for eight weeks, 10 weeks, and then they get bored, because there's nothing new to do after that, once you get used to the moves that the robot makes, dance moves and those kind of things. So how do you think you can address, you know, that problem of boredom that eventually creeps in education in that so you mean how we can make the education more useful continuously, not Yeah, yes, yes. We not only provide the hardware platform, we also write some competitions, especially soccer competition and the software competition, I think the most important thing, not only the competition itself, is not technology itself. You should make the competition or event be have good experience for consumers, so people can people will like to watch the competition, watch the video and

So how do you think you can address, you know, that problem of boredom that eventually creeps in education in that so you mean how we can make the education more useful continuously, not Yeah, yes, yes. We not only provide the hardware platform, we also write some competitions, especially soccer competition and the software competition, I think the most important thing, not only the competition itself, is not technology itself. You should make the competition or event be have good experience for consumers, so people can people will like to watch the competition, watch the video and
