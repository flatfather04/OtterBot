So the next slide, slide number two, will be the company overview slide that we have already, right? But, but it will be in the IC format. Yeah, I don't know if you know the IC format is very Yes, I'm aware. Yeah. So all the bullets on the left, you know the five sections? Yeah, five sections, right? So that that's why we have to re edit a little bit. Okay, so that's on the company. And then the third slide is the product. Yeah. Okay. So product, you can actually, you know, use some of the images that they have in the, you know, company presentation. Remember the Discover on the bottom and the control protect, yes, the front, in the top right, use that slide, add a couple of bullets that they have 4500 applications. They do a network only approach, and they use proprietary models, so maybe like four bullets and that image, yeah, be fine. Third slide, and then include the business model and GDM
