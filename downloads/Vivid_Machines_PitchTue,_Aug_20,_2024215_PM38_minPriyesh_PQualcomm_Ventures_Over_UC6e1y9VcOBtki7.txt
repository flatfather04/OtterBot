S Speaker 10:16Hey, Hi, Jonathan, how's it going? Pretty good. Pretty good, pretty good. How are you? Are you still in us? Yes, gonna be based here for for a bit, and then pretty but back and forth and but more long term, just gonna be here, I think, oh yeah. And where, where are you in SF? I'm in SF right now. Oh, interesting. We could have made this in person in that case, maybe

S Speaker 10:44absolutely, absolutely. So hi John as well. Yes, yes. I like the I would say the entirety of the team is based in the Bay Area, except a few who are still in San Diego. But everyone's in and around the San Mateo, San Carlos area, here,

S Speaker 11:07right, right. Are like Qualcomm's offices in Santa Clara, which is a little bit more south, but Santa Clara, yeah, but we usually meet here in San Mateo. We have a co working space here. So, so Yeah, how's everything going? I am sorry we could not meet at the event that time, I sort of realized that this could happen.

S Speaker 11:32absolutely, absolutely. So, Jonathan, I just want to catch up and sort of get to know what you guys are building. A little bit more in detail, I can give you a brief about how Qualcomm ventures operate, and then we'll hand it over to you to take it over from there. Yeah, sounds great.

S Speaker 126:08And how long does it take for them to sort of do the entire validation process? Is it one crop harvesting cycle or it's basically one season? Yeah, that's kind of an end. Our contracts are annual, so they sign for a season, and in some places they sign up for so we had a because we had customers last year, some of them renewed, and they actually signed on for three year contracts now. So there and the contracts are start. So they grow every year. They grow their encryption every year. And that's kind of the strategy, a little bit. So we start with small acreage, but then the idea is that they expand every year. Yeah, they might. They might not go to four acres in one year, but maybe double every year. So right, right. That's what we see in the

S Speaker 126:55interesting, John, I'm a little bit curious. I can see when, when you showed me the heat map of the entire farm, I I can imagine a farmer getting a lot of value out of it if, if they do it for, if they do the analysis for the entirety of the farm, why are farmers sort of deciding to do it for a one small area and then gradually expanding than sort of giving you the entire acreage at once.

S Speaker 128:49you preempting the round a little bit? Do you know what kind of revenue figures you'll have by the time you're raising, and how big a round would it be? Something like that we are targeting. So for revenue is going to be between 250 and 300 this year. So it's not, it's It's small, but we, we see some, yeah, all the interest from the customers, and it's really because they start with small acreage, and then there's a lot of potential. They expand full acreage with those, even with those existing contracts. But we're also going to sign on more customers. And for around we're targeting very loosely, five to 10, so maybe around eight ish, yeah, we can get there. And really the goal is to use some of that for resources to really improve, like both those powerful models and based on all the millions of images we collected, grow the team a little bit, of course, and then also scale into other crops, data collection, but also very sales effort. Yeah, that makes sense, John. And thanks a lot for this. This, this is quite interesting to us. It fits well with our thesis, so I'm sure the team would be happy to take it ahead when the time comes. I will loop in a few of my partners when you're ready with the materials and you want to have a discussion. A discussion about the fundraise, so we can take it out then. And I guess we are about time. I do have to run but one last question for you. I am assuming the hardware sells for a very small gross margin, and then you have a larger gross margin on the SaaS business. How do the numbers look? Basically, and it's, we don't even sell it. We just have a lease model right now, so people pay by pay per year for the for the hardware to use it. It's but it's insignificant to kind of a subscription, and it costs us between. It costs us around 3000 to make one, right? It's payback. After got it, I had one. If you have another second kind of metrics, or what specific things would you be looking at?
you preempting the round a little bit? Do you know what kind of revenue figures you'll have by the time you're raising, and how big a round would it be? Something like that we are targeting.

S Speaker 131:18So we do focus quite a lot on the team, and we prefer if the product has a very strong tech differentiation, if there is a proprietary tech mode which could stand for a long period of time, that's something that moves the needle for us, I guess, some validation from the market, some initial revenue, and Then there's a part to a stronger revenue growth down the line is also very exciting, and then given to the spaces computer vision that aligns, well, we sometimes do look for a few potential collaboration opportunities with Qualcomm, but that's not really a deciding factor for us. But other than the theme at this point early, it's the team, the tech stack, data mode, a little bit around JTM, things like that. Yeah, we should definitely stay in touch. I would say, also, I could propose there's enough interest. My co founder is going to be in town, also in the, I think, second week of September, if you're interested, we could meet in person and take a little deeper kind of also business metrics, your person. That sounds good. Yeah, I can. I can certainly meet. I can probably loop in someone else from the team, and we can have a chat around that. Let me know, as those plans materialize, I'll speak to the team, and we'll set something up Awesome. All right, yeah, absolutely. Thanks. Thanks a lot for your time. It was an exciting conversation. Appreciate it. Bye,
