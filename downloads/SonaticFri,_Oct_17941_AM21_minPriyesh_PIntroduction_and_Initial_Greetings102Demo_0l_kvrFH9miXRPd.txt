S Speaker 21:51like the vision and like, like I was saying what, what I really enjoyed about is, is there's a huge potential for it to be natively enabled in a lot of desktops and spaces where Qualcomm silicon ship, and I had a great conversation with Sahil as well. Poster Demo Day. Just tried to understand how the product roadmap seems to be shaping out what what you guys are planning to build in the future. So that's where, like, I would say, from a Qualcomm ventures perspective, it's super interesting and fits in some areas where we can add a lot of lot of value. But maybe before we dig deeper into the I can give you a quick background about the fund, how we operate, where check sizes lie. And then would love to understand how big a round Are you raising?

S Speaker 12:33Quick life story of yours when you grew up at all. And then how did you get into formal ventures? And then we are talking about the fund. When you talk about the fund, please love it, or like, is it I assume, like, it's like a CBC, so is there always, like, a potential interest of, like, acquisition, how it's like the terms look like, and like the like, general questions, you'll figure it

S Speaker 22:54out, absolutely, all five questions. So I grew up from, grew up in India, did my undergrad over there. I also went to IIT, not the same one as Sahil. I went to IIT Madras, did my undergrad from there. And I would say, while, while I was a biotechnology engineer during the entire time, I was very interested in startups. So I worked with about 1015, startups. Did, like, tons of internship during my undergrad, just trying to understand the early stage chaos in that sense, and quite enjoyed the experience. So I made a very strong decision to not work at any corporate as such, and sort of join a startup when I graduated. So I joined a clean tech startup in a series a stage as one of their early business hires joined in. The business development team grew into corporate development, started a couple of new business ventures for them, new product lines that they're scaling right now, and the company is filing for an IPO. So was a great experience, I'd say, all together. But it was also in a very I would say, it's called Clean max. So it's a B to B. Renewable Energy Company, we sell green energy said, set up solar and wind farms and sell it to the likes of corporates like meta, Amazon, every, every corporate that operates in India. So pretty interesting industry, for sure, but also traditional in that sense. So the sales cycles were huge. It was like six to nine months to close a deal, and the deals would be large, multi million dollars, for sure. It was, it was quite traditional in that sense. And I wanted to get back into sort of early stage entrepreneurial setup. And I realized I don't want to tie myself down to one idea at that time, and felt venture would be a great pivot if I make that so I moved to the US. It's been about four years since I've been here, moved to the US, did my MBA during that entire period, sort of ran the same playbook. Worked with about six to seven venture funds during my MBA. So for the two years I was there, I worked with Morpheus ventures, which is an LA based fund. Also worked with Menlo in the Bay Area, and then currently with Qualcomm ventures, for close to two years now, I've made six AI investments in the last year, particularly focus on AI applications and infra. So that's where my story lands. Happy to answer any questions around that before I jump into fund discussion.

S Speaker 28:02and the process are slow, so not to your liking and not to my liking either. The processes that we have is slightly slow, so it takes about four to five four to five weeks for us to come to a decision. The process is usually when I am discussing a meeting. Then we have every Monday I am meetings where we discuss the team, discuss the proposition. There is usually a hurdle in the US investment team, and then we have a stage two process where the entire global team votes, so the IC is the global stage two geo leads. But then the entire process would take anywhere from four to six weeks, roughly.

S Speaker 212:56For sure, absolutely. So the way it feels like Angel, and correct me, if I'm wrong here, there will be a lot of and I are you expecting that there will be a lot of pivots, from what sonatic looks like today to where the final vision of it is?

S Speaker 113:13the vision will never change. I'm very sure about this one. We're very strong on the vision. So I think, like, the vision is like, very general, right? And the past two phase vision is like, there are multiple ways today we are experimenting with one hunch. But if this hunch doesn't work, we have like, other hunches, which we will be playing around. But we'll never start working on any B to B SAS. We'll never start working on, like, verticalized agents. Will never work on something like it's a building like internal agent, Agent workflow, where you are building the proprietary system connected to proprietary data. There all those things came in my mind. People actually suggested as well, when you started the company, they'll never work on things like that.

S Speaker 213:58That makes sense, man and but personally, if I say things like this, excite me more to invest in, but then it also becomes a tougher proposition to sell within the fund. But then coming back to it so you currently have a To Do app, how do you see that expanding? How do you see from a product surface area, how do you see that expanding? And what points of your general thesis and the vision would that validate or not, and how do you plan to pivot from there,

S Speaker 114:28not pivoting, but definitely scaling into different branches. So one of the things where primary GTA place like go for bottom up approach more than a top down approach, because I think bottom up approach ability like Rosie, my company has more value. Plus the example can be perplexity notion all the likes like figma, then like something like UiPath, which is really bad taste. But so generally, I think going after, like, the whole white collar market, and making sure, like every single general purpose white collar worker somehow discovers us. And there are two ways to do it. One is like plg, and one is like having like unique, like taste and having like good content. And third thing is like literally building, like a phenomenal product where every single existing user adds, like an additional user to the dB. So very, very plg focused, type of company that's very focused on and have a look at the timeline. Since what you, I know you're most excited about the B to B thing. I think next year, May, we'll be having like, at least, like 100,000 plus users overall, like signed up to the product, and our daos will be like, easily hired than like 10k and 10k paying users is almost like 4 million error. And I think, I think the hockey stick growth for this kind of companies, like super high, for example. Just to give you context, like stag bliss was a five year old company, and when they released bold or new within the first, I think two weeks they did, the first four weeks they did, like, 20 million are and I think that general purpose, AI Asian market didn't take off yet because there has been an interest rates problem. The products are slow, and it was still a little mature. But I think the next, next cycle is there? Like, like, how wide coding is having its cycle

not pivoting, but definitely scaling into different branches. So one of the things where primary GTA place like go for bottom up approach more than a top down approach, because I think bottom up approach ability like Rosie, my company has more value. Plus the example can be perplexity notion all the likes like figma, then like something like UiPath, which is really bad taste. But so generally, I think going after, like, the whole white collar market, and making sure, like every single general purpose white collar worker somehow discovers us. And there are two ways to do it. One is like plg, and one is like having like unique, like taste and having like good content. And third thing is like literally building, like a phenomenal product where every single existing user adds, like an additional user to the dB. So very, very plg focused, type of company that's very focused on and have a look at the timeline. Since what you, I know you're most excited about the B to B thing. I think next year, May, we'll be having like, at least, like 100,000 plus users overall, like signed up to the product, and our daos will be like, easily hired than like 10k and 10k paying users is almost like 4 million error. And I think, I think the hockey stick growth for this kind of companies, like super high, for example. Just to give you context, like stag bliss was a five year old company, and when they released bold or new within the first, I think two weeks they did, the first four weeks they did, like, 20 million are and I think that general purpose, AI Asian market didn't take off yet because there has been an interest rates problem.

S Speaker 216:04right up. I agree, man, and I wouldn't sort of counter the fact that plg is the way to go down the line. If there is an enterprise play here, they the market will pull you, and you'll probably sort of branch it off as one smaller segment and work on it. But I agree with the fact that PLD to go bottoms up. Traction building is but, but from from say, a product perspective, say you reach 100,000 users by the next May you have 10 KDA use, what points of the product do you validate? I'm also sort of trying to understand what's the technical bet here, if you are to become the default interface to operate for humans to use AGI, what points of the product would you validate through this one year period, if we're
right up. I agree, man, and I wouldn't sort of counter the fact that plg is the way to go down the line.

S Speaker 116:52just trying to validate so we're building two kinds of frameworks. One is like browser use. One is the computer use. We have our own browser use framework. I don't know how much Sal has explained it to you. So we've been, we've been looking at evals as well, where we haven't tested our evals, but we literally, like, outperform most, like general purpose agent companies there on OS world, bench work on like, browser use, bench works. And second thing, how I think the product gets unique, and how we differentiate, primarily with two things, of course, the mix of both browser use and like, browser use and Kuwait is very novel. At the same time, the interaction design matters a lot today. What do you see on the original product is 20% done, and when you eventually get out, it will be like, very Apple style design with like, really high taste. And if you have context, I don't like I've seen the launch video on the website. I think that shot sort of like shows like, what's like, the type of, like touch we are going after. And I think it feels like very much like a creative technology update after we have, like, this sort of really good consumer attraction. I think it's easier to do enterprise sales today, the companies which have been doing like, the best enterprise sales are actually have, like a very bottom on motion that.

got it and and do you have commitments for that already? We got,
S Speaker 118:38like, 1.5 minutes of commitments. I'm trying to figure out who will be the ideal lead to work on. I'm talking to three firms, all multi stage. Very good. But I look for certain things in like, more than the firm. I look for the GP I work with, because I think adding like a value matters. We also talked to some cvcs, but the CVC we talked to is super big. I don't think we will pray for them right now. They make sense. More about A, B, but I think can still try. I'm still assessing this call, but I think it's still probably makes sense for like, small allocation, yeah, primary, primary thing, what excites me is, like when it will be running locally. I think it does make sense. And I think context is also doing that shit, so it makes sense, yeah, yeah.
