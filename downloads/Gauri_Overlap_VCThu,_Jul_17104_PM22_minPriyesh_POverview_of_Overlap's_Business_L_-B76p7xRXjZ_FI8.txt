S Speaker 10:00Intersection consumer and science. So doing a lot of Frontier tech investing for consumer focused companies, I kept hearing people say, you know, hardware is hard. We don't like things that are capital intensive. And so I was like, there has to be a better way to fund these companies that isn't necessarily just, you know, the incremental suburb or NSF grant. And so actually, the GP at my last firm is the one who introduced me to Justin, who's the founder and CEO at overlap, and he had was just leaving Apollo to start overlap. So his background is, he spent two decades at Apollo, the big private equity firm. He was a senior partner doing every type of financial structuring, restructuring, investing that you could possibly imagine. So kind of had a full Wall Street career. During that time, he touched frontier tech in a variety of ways, and just very quickly realized how inefficient the financing of these startups is. You know, most founders and VCs come from and know the world of tech and equity a lot better than the world of debt and scaling, which is the universe that Justin comes from. And so that was really the impetus behind starting the firm. So the way that we're set up, what we have actually about three business lines, investing, capital solutions and Government Solutions. On the investing side of the house, it's a traditional venture fund. Out of that fund, we're investing in seed Series A, Series B rounds of our peer tech companies, which for us, really just means true innovation with capital intensity. So we're very sector agnostic. We spend time across manufacturing, industrials, robotics, semiconductors, life sciences. Really. The only caveat that we have is that we don't invest in any pure software companies. We're also not leading any rounds. We're just following into rounds where there's a great firm leading. There's 15 portfolio companies we've co invested with folks like Lux founders, funding Square Ventures. And the reason that we're getting invited into these rounds is because these cap tables typically don't have that financial structuring skill set that we bring in our capital solutions business is custom built for that purpose. So that's the second business line that builds on the fact that offering to your tech companies in their life cycle need debt to scale, whether they're building a factory, funding, equipment, working capital, whatever they need, most folks only have a small handful of debt relationships. As you know, SVB was the most prominent example there, but through Justin's time at Apollo, he's cultivated relationships with almost 250 lenders that, in some way, shape or form, lend into this ecosystem. They might not call it frontier, and they might not even always be banks. They could be VDCs, mutual funds, insurance companies, and most importantly, everyone has their own very specific underwriting criteria. So it's really important to know what those are. We've actually built the treasure map for the debt ecosystem, and I'll show it to you in just a second. So basically, the idea is, we're talking to startups all day. We have these relationships with lenders. We set up a connection and take a finder's fee. That fee is only charged to companies that we are not invested in. If we are an investor in the company, we provide those same connections completely free of charge to the portfolio. And that's what's made us really popular as a follower of VC. On the back of that, we're actually building a third business, it's our Government Solutions. Government Solutions line. It's the exact same concept applied to the government funding ecosystem, connecting companies into the right funders within government that we just hired our 15 member. She's based in DC. She's ex pentagon, to run that. And again, that business is completely free for the portfolio, so just becomes another incentive to have us on the cap table

S Speaker 13:01up, show you that treasure map, because this will bring me to life a little bit. So this is our internal CR we build it from scratch. Is where we have all of those debt relationships. So we've got every single lender's name company stages that they're lending at, and then a ton of columns where we've cataloged on calls with everyone through their investment parameters. So check size ranges, financial requirements, debt types industries, and that just lets us be very pinpointed, more than anything else, be extremely efficient with the company's time. So yeah, that's pretty much us in a nutshell.

S Speaker 23:28Absolutely. Roy, thanks a lot for that overview. It was very comprehensive, and seems like it's a very, I would say, closed loop that you're building in there. It seems like it's a very strong value proposition that I don't find a lot of traditional venture capital. Sort of like, to your point, makes sense of for you to sort of get into the cap tables with a lot of tier one investors can see a differentiated value add definitely there. I can give you a quick background about Qualcomm ventures as well, and then happy to sort of see if there are areas that we overdo, but very quickly. Originally from India, I did my undergrad there, worked with an early stage startup, quite Broadway and unicorn, and there was a great experience. But wanted to jump into venture because I particularly enjoyed quite a lot working with very different startups all at once. And moved to the US about three years from now for my MBA, and been in this then I've worked a year at Morpheus ventures in LA, spent some time with Menlo Ventures in the Bay Area, and then currently with Qualcomm for a year and a half here as a senior associate investing in frontier AI, embodied AI, apart from that, the fund itself, we look at industrial automation, industrial SaaS, automobile tech stack, a lot of IoT, a lot of, I would say, XR as well, at times, some come connectivity Tech. So broadly speaking, Gauri, we are the strategic arm of Qualcomm, and we invest out of the balance sheet Global Fund. So we have offices across six different regions. Us being one of the main, most, biggest region where we have a strong mandate to deploy about 150 $280 million a year. Typically aim to invest anywhere from series A to in fact, even pre IPO rounds check size two to $10 million sometimes we have written bigger checks in later stage companies as well. Mostly, I would say in the recent past, we have gravitated out of investing in hardware and in the recent past, in the last few years, I would say our investments have been almost 80% into software companies. We internally at Qualcomm, we feel we do hardware well enough and and as as a result, not a big focus on semi, not a big focus on quantum, not a big focus on some some focus on robotics, I would say yes, because we feel our platforms could go, could go in there. But apart from that, have taken a step back from hardware per se. Even in fact, Qualcomm, in the last few years has diversified its business quite a lot, so not just sort of selling silicon to mobile play, mobiles right now to expanding into a PC platform, a cloud inference platform, XR IoT has always been some of our growth areas, and now we also see robotics and humanoids as a bigger growth area in the future. So team has been, or the corporate has been, expanding across some of these industries, and we feel we can add value by investing in software ecosystem around these platforms. So that's where I am particularly focused on, personally taking a very strong look at embodied AI and all the software stack that can go behind robotics and humanoid robotics, physical AI in general, and then vertical AI infrastructure companies, foundation models, everything around frontier AI as well. So that's where I am. At times we do look at some supporting technologies around the entire data structure, data center, infrastructure stack. So switches, not particularly silicon, I would say, but switches, pooling technologies, things like that. But I would say that's that's broadly it. And then in the few sectors you mentioned, I don't think we would do anything around life sciences, biotech, materials, things like that. They don't have any strategic relevance to Qualcomm in general.
Absolutely. Roy, thanks a lot for that overview. It was very comprehensive, and seems like it's a very, I would say, closed loop that you're building in there.

They don't have any strategic relevance to Qualcomm in general.
S Speaker 28:02So I would say both. Let's say, for example, if you take a humanoid company, they, many of them have partnered with AI model developer to sort of power their power the brains of the humanoid. But some of them also have an internal in house development of foundation models. So I guess both of them would be exciting for us, and particularly humanoids or robotics, is slightly different, because we feel Qualcomm silicon can power a lot of these hardware players down the line, Qualcomm has much more power efficient silicon than Nvidia Intel, per se. So we feel, for a lot of these players, we can power them. So that's slightly more strategic for that in that sense. But other than that, when I say embodied AI, I do mean a lot of software stack that goes behind the simulation, companies, companies building wearables, or companies building tele operations, data stack, things like that. Then a lot of simulations, sim to real companies looking at a lot of Earth model companies as well. So companies building foundation model for geospatial technology, Climate Technologies, some something around that. And then on the pure digital AI side, I would say frontier AI models, application stacks, companies building AI agents for different verticals, horizontal, horizontally agents as well, and in the entire infrastructure, tooling, middleware layer for that as well. Got it that is, that's
So I would say both. Let's say, for example, if you take a humanoid company, they, many of them have partnered with AI model developer to sort of power their power the brains of the humanoid. But some of them also have an internal in house development of foundation models. So I guess both of them would be exciting for us, and particularly humanoids or robotics, is slightly different, because we feel Qualcomm silicon can power a lot of these hardware players down the line, Qualcomm has much more power efficient silicon than Nvidia Intel, per se.

And then on the pure digital AI side, I would say frontier AI models, application stacks, companies building AI agents for different verticals, horizontal, horizontally agents as well, and in the entire infrastructure, tooling, middleware layer for that as well. Got it that is, that's
So I would say both. Let's say, for example, if you take a humanoid company, they, many of them have partnered with AI model developer to sort of power their power the brains of the humanoid. But some of them also have an internal in house development of foundation models. So I guess both of them would be exciting for us, and particularly humanoids or robotics, is slightly different, because we feel Qualcomm silicon can power a lot of these hardware players down the line, Qualcomm has much more power efficient silicon than Nvidia Intel, per se. So we feel, for a lot of these players, we can power them. So that's slightly more strategic for that in that sense. But other than that, when I say embodied AI, I do mean a lot of software stack that goes behind the simulation, companies, companies building wearables, or companies building tele operations, data stack, things like that.

S Speaker 29:56might be of the interest for sure, Gauri and I think what what we internally at a team would look look for in companies like those would be, is there a quick part to revenue? I don't think we sort of aim to invest in companies which seem like an R D project may have a big time down the line, but, but there's still technology risk in the company that we don't want to underwrite for so we prefer that there's a clear line to revenue and to that matter, in fact, a lot of AI model building companies for robotics seems way too overpriced, way too far off for us. So we sort of have to have that level of financial discipline that it makes sense, and it could return differentiated capitalism in a quick time.

S Speaker 212:36We have done a few consumer electronics investments in the past. Gauri a notable name there would be humane, but some of them didn't, didn't work as well. But yes, consumer electronics is a strong strategic area for Qualcomm. We have, we have some restrictions, or, I mean, not restrictions, I'd say, but we have some constraints internally within the ventures team to sort of look at those companies.

S Speaker 213:41Yeah, glass seems very interesting, especially because we work with a lot of ISP players. And as you can imagine, Qualcomm chips, chipsets which power more than a billion cameras every year. So computer vision, per se, is also a big focus area.

So for a lot of companies we invest in, or even sort of prospect and have a chart, we may try to make sure that we have made a lot of connections within Qualcomm. So if you come across any companies, even your portfolio companies, which feel that they can benefit from a GTM engineering Qualcomm as a customer, or them as a customer of Qualcomm proposition, happy to make those connections internally.

S Speaker 216:11it seems like a very interesting company. We, in the last year, launched our aipc chips, so that's an extension of our Snapdragon platform, and has NBU built in the device itself, so a lot of AI inference workloads can work on the device, and you don't have to send the model or send the input out to a model Hosted on Cloud. So seems like framework could be a good partner for that.
