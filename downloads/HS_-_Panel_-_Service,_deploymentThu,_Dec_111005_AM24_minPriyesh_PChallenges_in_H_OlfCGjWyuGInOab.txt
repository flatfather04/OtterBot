S Speaker 20:10And so my company supplies hardware to a lot of the large humanoid robot makers and their customers. And one of the things that I've noticed is that there are, there's a lot of energy and interest and investment that's going into the the the tech scouts at companies, and there's a lot of support from the high level executives who see the potential in there. They're reading the hype and get excited. But there's a messy middle right now, where you have a huge number of people who aren't so sure about humanoid robots. If we were in a marathon that we would still be in the stage humanoid robot energy is still in the stage of that bunching up at the beginning, where people are just beginning to get going, and so that messy middle of it, people and safety experts and and middle managers who actually have to think about ROI. We're working through that. So we're at the very beginning stages with huge potential ahead, but it's slow going.

S Speaker 11:12I would add to that that we also see to that point who owns the robot at the corporation, right? I mean, a humanoid, a human is managed by a human managing a humanoid. There's no robotics departments yet. You know, it doesn't want to necessarily manage these things. So that's another challenge of developing kind of robotics departments at the bigger corporations, industries, manufacturing, that actually manage the day to day of these robots. I mean, there's, there's no HR department for a humanoid. That's something messy.

S Speaker 31:42So yeah. I mean, we're kind of getting into it already, but I guess, what do you think about some of the barriers to more deployment
So yeah. I mean, we're kind of getting into it already, but I guess, what do you think about some of the barriers to more deployment

S Speaker 31:55do all the things that people want them to do right now. But yeah, I mean, I mean, I hadn't thought about things like that, like, who owns the humanoids? Who's responsible for them? You know, who's going to get fired if the humanoid breaks something important? And I'm wondering, like, are there other sort of unexpected barriers to more commercial deployment and success of these robots that you guys have encountered?

S Speaker 24:15I want to put to rest something right now the limits of teleop is not what's causing problems for robot customers. At the moment, we are way, way ahead of that. Teleop is an excellent tool, in my experience, for training robots for doing using humans to do the work. Sure, if you're thinking 510, years ahead and how you're going to hit huge scale. Tele op won't get you there, but right now, Tel OP is the tool. So I just wanted to put in a word for the tel op people in the audience and and we're more in my experience, seeing issues around trust and ROI and inertia right now. Trust. You know, the dirty little secret, of course, of all this is that robots, humanoids, aren't rated for the kinds of safety that's required yet in environments where people work with the robots, they're just not there yet. And so safety testing and trust needs to happen in order to get us to that stage. And the ROI is either you're either realistic about it or unrealistic, in my opinion, right now, you shouldn't be too tough on ROI. We're at the beginning of an industry. We're at the beginning of learning how these things work. So if you're if you're trying to apply the same ROI principles to humanoids that you do to PCs and memory cards, you're making a mistake. So these are some of the factors that are that are getting in the way of the kind of deployment we're

all excited about. Yeah, and customers very ROI Focused, right? I mean,
S Speaker 48:09I want to quickly respond to what Joe said about the ROI you're right in terms of from a business standpoint, we should not be too closely monitoring the ROI, but at the same time, have realistic expectations about where can I get business impact, having a deeper understanding of that we've always seen as a profound input to the technology trajectory. Because what we don't want, at the end of the day is engineers and scientists working in labs to develop amazing technologies. But there's, there's a big gap with the reality, so having some realistic expectations about where they can make business impact will also have a good input in the technology side.

S Speaker 39:13do you feel like, like, where are we at in that curve of actually, like, understanding practically, where these things are? I'm sure there's a lot of learnings from the AMR world. And you know, previous 1000 automation, we

S Speaker 19:26have a good success rate talking about force multiplier. It can take away some of the more mundane tasks. You can focus on some of the more crucial tasks to your job. So you don't have an AMR that might be a cleaning robot. Okay, well, now the janitorial staff has more time to focus on other things, and we've seen that it hasn't replaced jobs in those cases, right? And that that works well in the restaurant environment, more tips I can turn tables faster because I now have this automated bus boy coming to my table and who doesn't like, more tips, more money. So force multiplier is the big thing that we have seen work, but it's a good point making sure that the co workers of the robot are happy that it's there. Yeah.

S Speaker 210:08I mean, I think that humanoid is a tool for the worker, just like any other tool right now, for many jobs, and you you have to for any worker that that's using a drill or or or a press or a PC or anything like that. You have to, you have to build that trust. Can I count on it? Can I, can I, does it do what it says it's going to do? And I think there's an added element with human points, because they seem human, so we expect them to be, to have a bit of a personality, and something that we can, you know, how do we feel about them? And I think, you know, we're just beginning to understand that. And the better the tech gets, the better it performs, the happier I think people will will be when you start deploying the kinds of human like features that we saw in the Disney presentation this morning. You know that that's certainly going to to comfort.

S Speaker 213:01speaker from skilled AI challenged others to to show the steps the robots performing well on stairs. And I want you, I want to challenge in a similar manner for you to look critically at the types of manual interactions that you're seeing in videos is we're still mostly at the parallel gripper stage. And if, if you know, if parallel grippers were good enough to run and build the world, I think God would have given all of us two digits instead of five with a postal thumbs. They're not capable today of doing much more than then, pinching, grasping, picking up bins. I think the real promise will come when dexterity is more prevalent, and we're not there, you know, yet on a wide scale. But that's, that's the payoff. And, you know, look critically at a lot of videos you see to see whether the robots are doing, doing real manual work, valuable work, not just stitching.

Like, it doesn't even need a voice, because it's just going to be doing grunt work, and it's not taking care of children and elderly. It's like, no, it's working with humans. It needs to be able to interact with humans, right? It needs to have a sort of bedside manner. And, you know, that's something to think about on top of all the obvious, you know, safety or getting out of the cage that kind of, I mean, do you feel like the humanoid industry has like, there's like, how many more mistakes do we need to make? And you think that those mistakes are ones that may set us back, you know, thinking about safety ones, obviously. But like, are we on the right track to actually continue this sort of incremental adoption and eventual realization of a world where humanoids are ubiquitous and mundane, even
human interact. Like, something started, like, maybe you think, Oh, I'm building for an industrial or, like, maybe mining application. My robot doesn't even need a face.

And, you know, that's something to think about on top of all the obvious, you know, safety or getting out of the cage that kind of, I mean, do you feel like the humanoid industry has like, there's like, how many more mistakes do we need to make? And you think that those mistakes are ones that may set us back, you know, thinking about safety ones, obviously. But like, are we on the right track to actually continue this sort of incremental adoption and eventual realization of a world where humanoids are ubiquitous and mundane, even
S Speaker 415:05we are just getting started, we will make mistakes, and that's how we're going to learn. And then we're going to get better fall, get up and learn from it enough to be able to drive the adoption, I think, safety, human, machine, understanding, interaction, collaboration, and focus on cost so that it delivers commercial impact of clients. So having these kind of lenses will really drive the technology in the right direction. It's not only investing in AI and hardware, but it is also the foundational tools that is required to build the systems in a scalable way. So as long as I think we kind of cover some of these grounds, we're not going to make
we are just getting started, we will make mistakes, and that's how we're going to learn. And then we're going to get better fall, get up and learn from it enough to be able to drive the adoption, I think, safety, human, machine, understanding, interaction, collaboration, and focus on cost so that it delivers commercial impact of clients.

S Speaker 115:46valuable mistakes. Yeah, like Ron said, mistakes is how we learn, right? We're going to make a lot of them, and we should be making a lot of them. And I would still encourage people to get out of the lab. You know, mentioning the robot going up the stairs, is a guy from Wisconsin who slipped on some ice last week, much to my wife's delight. I would like to see a humanoid robot on some ice. I mean, those climates you know, one of the guys on my team works at Tahoe as a ski patrol. I would like to see a humanoid robot do ski patrol. Like to see something like that happen.

S Speaker 216:23If you look at the progress, the rate of progress that humanoids are making over the past 24 months, it's staggering. I mean, it's beyond mind blowing. How many new entrants there are in this space, how much capability there is on the software side, on the hardware side, how much investment there is, we're going to make tons of mistakes. But you know, let's be clear, we are now on, on that super exciting glide path to to massive scale. It just, we have to be patient. It's like any especially hardware, new technology. It just, it takes time. It goes a little bit at its own pace, because the technology has to catch up with desires, and we have to trust it. But over time, we overestimate what we can accomplish, you know, in the short term, and underestimate what we'll accomplish in the long term. The long term is super exciting. We just have to be patient with it and keep at it at this pace, at this rate we're gonna get,

S Speaker 118:16Yeah, I would agree on hardware is very hard, and one of the one of the biggest mistakes I see robotic companies make is having too many versions of their product they don't commercialize. Like to say, you need to get your your solidified version, and this when you're out of production and state right, you get your version and you throw it into that photocopier that is mass manufactured and create 50, 100 identical units. We work with so many companies that haven't done that, and they've got 100 units out in the field, and they're all unique, special little flowers, and they're possible to take care of, because each one is slightly different in some way, and it's just a big moving target. And Robotics has an entirety of an industry, and humanoids, particular, its current state is roughly where the internet was in 1997 I would say it's still early. There's a lot

S Speaker 219:10to come. One other thing I'll add is something that is missing, that we all need, is standards interoperability. Right now I feel like it's super balkanized. Someone will come to me and say, Hey, guy, here's what I'm looking here's the solution I'm looking for. And I feel like I'm trying to Frankenstein together a bunch of different parts and pieces across hardware and software. So the you know, thank God for Nvidia and others who are really trying to create, you know, kind of standard platforms that we can all use, you know, to plug into and their confidence gives me, gives me more confidence that as an industry, we're going to develop some common standards that make this easier, not so disjointed.

S Speaker 319:53I mean, you mentioned 1987 and we all know what happened couple years after that. And I think there's probably some concern here, maybe that we have, that there is so much investment, there's so much hype, it's obviously tied to what's going on in AI, more broadly. And I think a lot of people are reasonable to say that, you know, there's, it's likely that we will have some, you know, something will happen. It'll be a hit to valuations. You know, we'll have a period, maybe even a robotics winter, another AI winter, where it's a little bit harder to raise money, where you don't have journalists scrambling to write a humanoid story every day, you have to work a little bit harder. CEOs aren't just buying humanoids because it's cool thing to do. They want to really understand. I mean, if that were to happen in the next few years here, what would be your advice to smaller, younger robotics companies to sort of prepare and see themselves through that period till we do get to that, the next wave where they're joining up again, I guess. Yeah. I mean,

S Speaker 420:51we've been through this boom and bust cycles and different technology and markets over several decades. You know, biotech is a good example where there was lot of investment made, but still tangible returns are still years away, not decades away. So we've been through this several times now, when the hard times come, it's definitely the ones that are really tying their efforts into a client's business outcomes are the ones who are really going to survive, and it is hard to do in the technology world, in the hardware world. So as long as, you know, the founders and engineers focus on what client problem are they solving and are they delivering commercial impact, as long as we have our eyes on that, I think whatever the cycle we may go through because we're delivering value, they will survive.

S Speaker 121:44I mean, I really wish I would have been able to buy some Microsoft stock in 1997 right? It's not to say that it's, you know, these these cycles aren't going to happen. It's not to say that it's not going to affect everybody. But again, to Rob's point, focus on your mission. Focus on outcomes with customers. Focus on what the customers want. I've seen a lot of robotics companies kind of get really high up on the technology, and they're chasing a technological milestone that when it gets into production, you try to go to that ROI case, the customer just goes, okay, but I can't pay more than this. It's got to do this. Yeah, it's got all these cool features. Don't care. It just needs to do this. So focus, focus, focus on what the end customer once focus on, on that ROI and just, you know, keep at it.

S Speaker 222:35Yeah, I've worked in a bunch of startups. I could almost give a two hour talk on what advice I would give to smaller robotics companies at this stage, but a few things I would say are, get your technology in the hands of customers earlier, not later. Find the customers who are tolerant of less than perfect technologies, and get customer feedback that is way more valuable than as I think I heard a moment ago, trying to perfect your technology. Engineers will try to perfect something that's their nature. Don't let them get that get that technology out in the field. Also assume people always joke, if you're going on a long trip, you lay out all the clothes you plan to take and all the money and take half the clothes of twice the money. You know, the same is true for, for powering a smaller company, through, through, through the chaos of trying to get, get success plan for longer, longer engineering cycles, more money, more runway. And, you know, and be the open. You can't guard everything super carefully. Be open to working with with others and it all. It all comes together.
