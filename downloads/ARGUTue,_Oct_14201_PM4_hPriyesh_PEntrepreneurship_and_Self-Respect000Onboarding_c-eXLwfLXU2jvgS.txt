Do you think a guy like me in his 20s from a small city in Guwahati would have afforded a car like this and taken his parents on foreign vacation if I had stuck to the traditional lounge of society? No?

S Speaker 126:52What would you do with 10? Cross I can start a jewelry store with 10 every store would be more than that. It's about 30 crores. One thing I feel is broken in jewelry stores is, whenever people go shopping, it could be a married couple. It could be, say, a father daughter. The experience of walking into a jewelry store is very overwhelming and daunting, because often, whoever you're taking there to buy them something can pick something that you can't afford. So if there were a jewelry store with a ceiling, let's say, for example, nothing costs more than one lakh rupees. I feel the experience of going in there and shopping might be less overwhelming, quite interesting. $8 for that chicken. I do not think so. Excuse me, I will give you four. What? Four or I am walking away. I can't change the price of the groceries. Okay? I am walking away. I am walking away. You will lose the sale.
