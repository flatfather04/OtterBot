S Speaker 11:36got it, and I would assume the company is also based out of yours, right? Okay, perfect, perfect. Well, that's amazing, Elio, and thanks a lot for taking the time to speak to me. I know you are in fundraising actively right now, so I appreciate the time, because it's probably not the perfect cadence, but broadly, lub, I'll give you a brief overview about Qualcomm ventures, how we operate as a fund, where, what are the areas that we look at, but particularly for this call as a team, we are also very actively looking at vertical applications, and we've been tracking a lot of sectors over years, trying to see which which sector became, becomes ripe for, say, an agentic sort of disruption. And we feel GDM marketing sales was probably last year, and we invested in crest company in that specific area for call center automation. We feel GDM marketing are some areas which would be very interesting for adoption. In terms of adoption, they are reaching an inflection point this year, and particularly excited to talk to you about that. But broadly at the fund, I'm a Senior Associate here at Qualcomm ventures, been with the Fund for about a year and a half now. Prior to that, I was briefly with Menlo Ventures and spent a year with MOS ventures in LA the fund itself, we've been around for 25 years. Leo deployed about two and a half billion dollars in capital. And every year it's a global fund. So we have offices across the globe, one in Brazil as well, but just in us, we try to deploy about $150 million a year, or typically, a Series A investor. So we our check sizes could be anywhere from two to $10 million and invest in AI quite actively. But apart from that, IoT, industry automation, robotics, a lot of deep tech spaces are also exciting for us, while we are the corporate venture now, of Qualcomm, we sort of take this as a very as something that a financial venture capital would do. So we have to follow all the financial discipline as as a fund, and try to very actively partner with some of the startups we invest in, both from a perspective of, can we get Qualcomm as a customer to them, but also at the same perspective, can we sort of partner with you for some of our GTM activities, for some of our CO branding, get to the enterprise customer together, kind of partnerships we've expanded quite a lot across multiple platforms, from just being mobile to now having a cloud data center platform, having an aipc platform. So we feel we can, we can add strategic value from an engineering perspective

S Speaker 24:21But then after college, I moved to Spain, and that's where I started my career. So, like, worked all over Europe, and then Brazil, India, you know, South Africa. So traveling all over for, like, telecom projects, right? And then I decided to do an MBA, which I did at MIT. And then since then, I stayed in the US. I spent most of my time at the Entrepreneurship Center, and so fell in love with this idea of, like, starting companies. Yeah, my first company was actually in telecommed media, because it was a rington company. You remember when the company around that? It was quite successful. We sold it when we were about $40 million in revenues. And then after that, I did it on the startup in the ad tech space. So like, basically building a network of publishers and buyers of mobile ads. And then after selling that to a different company, I started third company that did not succeed, but it was a great idea that still to this day, I think one day I will retake that idea, because it was basically we wanted to build, like the Google Analytics for offline by leveraging Wi Fi and Bluetooth devices to monitor and track like mobile devices to understand, like, how many people are in a certain like store or location and like for maybe media purposes and stuff like that. That didn't work out, like, because retailers are terrible buyers. Through

S Speaker 25:39company, I met my current co founder and like, within like, a few years, like, you know, exploring ideas, I decided to, I got offered, like, a great job at AWS here in New York, to lead all of their startup efforts. And so, like, supporting mid to late stage startups. Yeah, was there for four years. It was great. I built the AWS global startup program, but I never stopped thinking about my next venture. And then in 22 my co founder and I decided to take the leap and start a skillset we which was more, really out of an idea that I got when I was working at AWS, because I had always imagined AWS as a place where, like, everything worked. I mean, I always work at companies, and I started a co founder, so, like, at the beginning, probably startups growing fast, CRM data being, like, terrible. And then I got to AWS, and my assumption was okay, when I get there, like, I see perfect data everywhere. And it was not the case. So like, the idea that a people CRMs are full of terrible data, and we that in the age of AI, this cannot stay true for longer, was like the key insights that that we wanted to achieve and solve a scale stack. So we started the company left AWS in the summer of 22 in 23 we raised a pre seed a million. We started working with some customers. Then we raised a scene last year, and, like, expanded revenues. And then the idea right now, and the idea is that to do, like, seriously, sometime this year, yeah. And so for because of that, we're doing a lot of different things. Like, you know, not only, like playing a like, putting a lot of effort like go to market and acquiring new customers, which seems to be picking up quite substantially. We just released our new website, which I put here just this week, and so we're basically getting ready to get into good shape for the series A some time this year.

S Speaker 17:19That's very exciting overview. Thanks a lot for that, Elio, and certainly a lot of successes in your career. So congrats on that. That's that's very inspiring. Elio, tell me a little bit more about the product and the workflow you're solving for I understand the broader problem in general, but how is the workflow for some of these enterprises? I assume you're you're trying to sell it, sell it to bigger enterprises, not the mid market today. How is the workflow for some of these enterprises today? What part of the workflow Are you planning to automate with? Ai,

S Speaker 27:56the idea, see, we work, yes, we work for enterprises. I think mid market is also part that, like, the key component are, they need to have at least 20 plus reps, sales reps, right? They to have, like, at least, like, a few years in market, yeah, because it means that their CRM is then, like, full of data, yes, which also bad data. And then, like, with clear ICP, which means, like, you know, at least Series C and above startup. And then, you know, like, right now, we haven't gone to the really largest enterprises, not because we cannot do that, but because the sales cycle would be too difficult to digest for like, stuff like ours. But we, you know, we have a sweet spot between, let's say, 500 700 employees and 7000 10,000 that's our sweet spot right now, because the deal cycle moves quite quickly, and we can close them a good pace, but we could target also the largest enterprises, And so we are starting to work with like Adobe in an early cycle, and customers include MongoDB and, you know, others. So
the idea, see, we work, yes, we work for enterprises. I think mid market is also part that, like, the key component are, they need to have at least 20 plus reps, sales reps, right? They to have, like, at least, like, a few years in market, yeah, because it means that their CRM is then, like, full of data, yes, which also bad data.

And then, you know, like, right now, we haven't gone to the really largest enterprises, not because we cannot do that, but because the sales cycle would be too difficult to digest for like, stuff like ours. But we, you know, we have a sweet spot between, let's say, 500 700 employees and 7000 10,000 that's our sweet spot right now, because the deal cycle moves quite quickly, and we can close them a good pace, but we could target also the largest enterprises, And so we are starting to work with like Adobe in an early cycle, and customers include MongoDB and, you know, others. So
the idea, see, we work, yes, we work for enterprises. I think mid market is also part that, like, the key component are, they need to have at least 20 plus reps, sales reps, right? They to have, like, at least, like, a few years in market, yeah, because it means that their CRM is then, like, full of data, yes, which also bad data. And then, like, with clear ICP, which means, like, you know, at least Series C and above startup.

the idea is this, that if you are
the idea is this, that if you are
S Speaker 115:14right, right. Very, very interesting. Elio, very interesting. And thanks for the demo. So a few questions there. Would you, would the platform also work in lead generation? Or do you actually start from a CRM, a data source or data warehouse, and do your entire enrichment pipeline from there on?
right, right. Very, very interesting. Elio, very interesting. And thanks for the demo. So a few questions there. Would you, would the platform also work in lead generation? Or do you actually start from a CRM, a data source or data warehouse, and do your entire enrichment pipeline from there on?

S Speaker 215:34So we so we can do both. But like, the pitch to customers is really that, like, first you need to get, like, to a foundational data that is good and robust. Then you add data, because that's what's behind in a lot of go to market teams. They buy data from zoom info, they buy data from CrunchBase, they buy data from six cents, and then it becomes a mess where, like, there is a lot of duplicates, a lot of confused data, and nobody uses that because they don't trust it. And so that's why we prefer to start from the existing data in the CRM clean in the you orchestrate hierarchies and all of that, and then add new data. That's typically the the workflow logic that we follow. But some customers like, you know, have a start from like, oh, I need to deploy a workflow to do. For instance, this is a super cool workflow that we deployed for MongoDB. They have not here. They have a product, which is their free tier product called Atlas, and they have hundreds of 1000s of sign ups every month, but they were not using them until now because the data was very messy. And so what we have deployed is that a workflow that starts from the raw data the signups that oftentimes have, like Gmail addresses or Hotmail, or whatever, and then starts to de anonymize that email to get to potentially a LinkedIn profile. And once we have the anonymized to a LinkedIn profile, then we start enriching if the profile is interesting, and so we start adding details about the company they work at, or the title or the manager title, or the buying group there, and etc, etc, and then put it back into the CRM so that sales can act on this. Yeah? Because for this, like, sales would tell them, Oh, these are gmails. I'm never gonna email a Gmail. Yeah,
So we so we can do both. But like, the pitch to customers is really that, like, first you need to get, like, to a foundational data that is good and robust.

Yeah? Because for this, like, sales would tell them, Oh, these are gmails. I'm never gonna email a Gmail. Yeah,
S Speaker 117:36that that makes sense earlier. And for for that workflow that, let's take the case of the MongoDB case, that workflow is it. Would you say it's more agentic? Would you say it's more if else, because at a lot of places I saw you, you actually do more deterministic understanding of whether the next step should be taken or not. So would you say the model is more agentic or more deterministic and who creates the entire workflow? Is it scale stack developing the entire workflow custom for a MongoDB or do you give them the picks and shovels and they create the entire workflow themselves?
that that makes sense earlier. And for for that workflow that, let's take the case of the MongoDB case, that workflow is it. Would you say it's more agentic?

S Speaker 218:15So the degree of agentic component depends on like, what type of use case we need to solve for, for instance, there is this workflow that we just deployed for a customer that is actually mostly agent, so we don't have any preconceived idea. So, like, this is, for instance, for an HR platform, yeah, and want to map investors to companies and companies to people, and so a lot of the modules see, for instance, this ones, these are all like agentic. And then,

S Speaker 121:54right? And, and the the flow product that you're launching seems pretty, pretty interesting. What? What's the thought process behind it? And like maybe taking a step back, what's your GTM today? Given you are in this space, I'm sure you have amazing set of outbound data for your own use case. What's your GDM today? And do you think the flow product launch would make it more self serve. Are you trying to go that direction?

22:23We're not very interested in self serve. I think
We're not very interested in self serve. I think
We're not very interested in self serve. I think
We're not very interested in self serve. I think
S Speaker 222:25I'm interested in accelerating the deal cycle. Customers want to run mini POCs like run experiments we can run now, these experiments live during the demos, the self serve thing. I mean, there is other solution for that, like clay, and we're not interested in that. We want to be the solution that every company that uses Salesforce, basically like will need this to clean and rich and prioritize all of their data for any number of use cases. Agentic, non agentic, orchestrate visual capabilities operationally. So this is more for actually attracting customers. Hey, build a quick demo workflow yourself, and then talk to us. Hey, like, you know, during the demo, let's build the demo workflow, test it out with your data, and then, like, you know, let's discuss, like, how we can deploy it into your you know, environment, right? So that's the strategy in terms of what's our go to market? I mean, I think right now, like everything is changing, outbound is like a disaster right now. So it's more like, first of all, LinkedIn, me as a key spoke person, yeah. So I'm very active on LinkedIn, doing a series of dinners and small events and round tables. I run a podcast that is gaining quite some, like, neat audience, and then we do a lot of content that gets, like, distributed on like YouTube and LinkedIn and all of that stuff. So that's the vehicle for all of our go to market. We relaunched the website because it was in need of relaunching. But like, I would say, the majority is like my face, and then like the content that we generate through all of this stuff, and then in person stuff is so important. And so we do, like small dinners, like 1520, people. We sell it to. Revolves marketing ops, you organize a dinner, you get like, five amazing leads, and then, like, we start working, move to the next dinner, move to the next round table. The podcast is a great way to do sort of like ABM,

S Speaker 225:20Average contract value is about $90,000 a year. So we have 11 customers now, and we price it per workflow. So it's a platform fee per workflow, and depending on how much agentic components there are, like, there are like five tiers, cheaper, $2,000 a month. The most expensive is like 8000 and then it's a per usage component. So how many objects do we
