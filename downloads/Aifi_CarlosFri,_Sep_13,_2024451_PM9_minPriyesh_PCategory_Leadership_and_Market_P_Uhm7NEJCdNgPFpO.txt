S Speaker 10:03assert that they are the category leader, the other guys have Fla, you know, faltered, right number one, if we can assert that the first or unit economics makes sense so the value prop is clear, yeah, right. Makes sense the customer makes sense to them, then this thing will be a winner. May take a little longer, but it will be a winner,

S Speaker 10:38maybe we should do an exercise. Here's the, you know, the segment, there's like, kajaka store. The economics is this kind of stuff. There's a stadium. The economics is this kind of stuff, etc, right? Say, Yes, they can. They can, per store, make this much money. And they're, you know, there's this many stores, so you know, they can tap into the huge opportunity, right? So it's just a matter of execution, matter of time, right? Implementation, but so and then we can say, yeah, these guys can grow at whatever percent, you know, we can back it up right, like, right. And then with that, we get more than a 50 million top line, which is, yeah, arguably low, right. And again, Tushar was good point on the multiples. So maybe we use a seven, eight multiple with a characteristic of company that's doing better, right? Okay, so that's the exercise I'd like to do. Right value. How much do you generate per store? Kind of store, what's the potential, right? And then let's go, go back to the email. I think it was one of them replied. Remember that zippin is this, and the other gun is that? You know, I don't remember if it was Fabio or if

S Speaker 22:15it was Steve. It was JD, but it was JD, JD, yeah, yeah, yeah.

it was Steve. It was JD, but it was JD, JD, yeah, yeah, yeah.
S Speaker 12:21So maybe try to find a way to validate some of that. Okay, right? But, but again, we have, we have, what I think is a category leader in a large market. It's working, right? The valuation is not unreasonable, and this could be big, not putting some more money in, to me, feels like a mistake. I think we're being too conservative, right? We're not in the business we're in the business of doing informed, taking informed decisions, right? Yeah, and if we work these things out a little bit in more detail, right? And don't shoot ourselves in the foot by assuming just, oh, I take this number, right? Try to build something a little bit more bottoms up versus tops down. Um, then I'm I think you and I should sit down with Quinn just on the one on one conversation and say, quit. Here's why we think we should invest more, right? It's the next we have. Initial check was four, then we did the follow on plus one. That's five, plus the 520 plus the whatever is approved, six, corner seven is, is nothing, right? This by now, this is a, see, you know, you know, serious B, Series C, company, we, you know, we write first checks of $5 million of $7 million right? On stuff we don't know. This is stuff we know. Yeah, right, so,
So maybe try to find a way to validate some of that. Okay, right? But, but again, we have, we have, what I think is a category leader in a large market. It's working, right?

S Speaker 24:11I do have all the data points to sort of create this entire story, so I think I can get it done.

S Speaker 14:18Yeah? So let's try to do that again. Let's not do this on Monday. Let's not do this in the I am meeting right, if we can, you know, by, say, By Wednesday, sit down with Queen and say, Hey, here's this, and I'm gonna try. I'm gonna reach out to Fabio try to get an update on the business. Okay, okay, I sent the text to Neeraj. Neeraj said he would have more info on the SPV next week, but I am. Bottom line is, I don't want to go down without a fight, so

S Speaker 14:57Okay, all right, so that's this on the electrification stuff. You sent me some stuff. You sent me some list of companies to go see which ones are interesting for us to follow up on, right? Yeah, yeah, okay. I'll review over the weekend. I'll come back to you Monday, right? Okay. On
Okay, all right, so that's this on the electrification stuff. You sent me some stuff. You sent me some list of companies to go see which ones are interesting for us to follow up on, right? Yeah, yeah, okay. I'll review over the weekend. I'll come back to you Monday, right? Okay. On

S Speaker 15:20I decided just yesterday, today I'm going to go to New York climate week. Okay, so maybe you can meet up with some folks. Let's prepare that. But maybe I can meet up with some folks there. I also gave up on trying to complete something by the end of the fiscal year. Forget it. I don't care, right? Because it's, it's given everything that's going on as it's just not gonna happen. So whatever. But, but we continue to work, yeah, we continue to work right and wrap it up in in the before, okay,

S Speaker 25:55one question that Carlos, our thesis does not cover storage and generation. If I do come up some through some of these demo days, or to south or through some VC meetings, if I do come across some companies which are interesting in the that space, we look at that opportunistically, or No,
one question that Carlos, our thesis does not cover storage and generation. If I do come up some through some of these demo days, or to south or through some VC meetings, if I do come across some companies which are interesting in the that space, we look at that opportunistically, or No,

S Speaker 16:14probably not. Generation, maybe storage. Okay, okay, right, yeah, storage might be a little closer to us, and I fully believe storage is a key part of distributed energy resources, right? It's key. It's key because you have a lot of intermittent sources like wind and sun, you got to capture that. You got to store that, right? So in terms of grid resilience and reducing cost. It just makes sense. The generation piece is just such a different beast.
probably not. Generation, maybe storage. Okay, okay, right, yeah, storage might be a little closer to us, and I fully believe storage is a key part of distributed energy resources, right? It's key.

S Speaker 16:56Yeah, it feels like it's, it's a different, you know, chemistry, whatever it feels more very moved from us.
Yeah, it feels like it's, it's a different, you know, chemistry, whatever it feels more very moved from us.
Yeah, it feels like it's, it's a different, you know, chemistry, whatever it feels more very moved from us.
Yeah, it feels like it's, it's a different, you know, chemistry, whatever it feels more very moved from us.
S Speaker 27:10Fair enough, right? Fair enough. Yeah, not. Okay, yeah. Sounds good. Sounds good. One, one point on the multiple we use Carlos, 9x we had a long discussion on it. 9x was to us, even back then, seemed a little bit aggressive, but we eventually decided to go with it, because we have been very aggressive in cutting down the numbers and two, servan was projecting at it at 15x so that gave us some conviction on that.
Fair enough, right? Fair enough. Yeah, not. Okay, yeah. Sounds good. Sounds good.

S Speaker 17:45yeah, you know, I'll probably land at 8x whatever. Seven, 8x I'd rather move the numbers. We have to tell a story that, you know, here's how I think about when I take, usually, entrepreneurs. PNLs, I usually my numbers are the early years are moved slower. I don't have a problem in the later years growing faster than their numbers. I mean, I'm surpassing. Because if I believe in the story right then, then, you know, if I think it's a winner and the market's large, it should go up, right? Entrepreneurs make this mistake of saying, you know, we grow very fast and then we grow slower, which is not the reality, right? Things take longer to take off, yeah, but if, again, if it's the right thing, and it does take off, then, you know, right? It should. It should grow at a healthy clip, right? Yeah, it takes a long time for you to get to a point where,
yeah, you know, I'll probably land at 8x whatever. Seven, 8x I'd rather move the numbers. We have to tell a story that, you know, here's how I think about when I take, usually, entrepreneurs.

Yeah, it takes a long time for you to get to a point where,
S Speaker 18:57you're revenue growth, right? I think in the that's my view. That's my view. So can you take a step at the sort of the economics, the number of stores, the Perry, you know, how much is generated per store, etc, yeah, that way we can try to say, here's the potential, and try to get a better sense. Because, you know, I just looked at the PnL, Yes, sounds good, etc. I never spend more time. And, but maybe we were too conservative.
you're revenue growth, right? I think in the that's my view. That's my view.
