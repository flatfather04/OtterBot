S Speaker 20:58I know, I know edge is a big focus area for us. So definitely an interesting space that you're building in down the line. Wendy, I would like to route this through one of our partners who is more focused on AI guard rails and adjacent areas, but happy to do a introductory call today and then take it over from there. So

S Speaker 34:05great, you can see it, right? Yes, okay, great, yeah. So this is an exciting technology that we've developed called noise based communication, and this was something we created ourselves originally to do secure medical image processing, and then we realized that we could use this as well to send very secure messages. And so with typical encryption, we try to scramble the message to make it very expensive to undo that, but we take a very different approach. We generate these noise signals, these high dimensional random vectors, before we even know what the message is going to be. And then we can take that noise, a signal, and put that out into the open internet or a clear channel, and if an adversary finds it, it just looks like static background noise, and with our synchronized system, we can reconstruct that back into the data. We then take it a step further, and we combine it with our Omni seal as a form of steganography, where we disguise the noise as an unrelated image. And so this allows you to have what we call deniable communication, where it's not obvious that you're sending any kind of message at all. It looks like you're just background internet traffic, right? And so this is our noise protocol, and we can do this for images and text and data. And what I'd love to show you is live with a route with their rover here. If you can see

S Speaker 36:02and here we have this high dimensional noise vector that is representing the joystick position. And if I move that, we're going to send that data over and then onboard the little computer. We're going to take that noise and map it back into the action command. But what you want to notice is that we're never sending the same code twice. This bar code pattern is essentially never repeated, and that allows us to essentially have a new custom language every time we run the model. And so, kind of like during World War Two, we have the Navajo wind talkers that spoke in the native language, because it was very difficult for people to understand that every time we establish a link, we're creating a brand new language, essentially made out of randomness, and we never have to repeat it, because there's just almost an infinite number of those.

S Speaker 37:06So if we go here and so, we can use this now for Internet of Things, sensor networks, access control any kind of situation where we want a very secure communication back and forth. And so we can do that from one to one, one to many, sort of a broadcast mode, and it's very fast. We're just using consumer equipment at this point. If we had a custom chip, then we could do very high throughput signals, high bandwidth signals. Because one

S Speaker 37:57Yeah. So here we can take an image and encode it as noise, and then we can encode that image behind another image, and then we can do that for all of the frames in a movie. And so it allows us to take one video and disguise it as an unrelated video

S Speaker 18:31And we've been talking, we have been in discussion, and we're still in discussion with the US government to use this for the military. And one of the key thing you ask is about, you know, computation overhead on the edge, right? Well, we will have to build FPGA chip, or we were to do ASIC and then King kraka.

S Speaker 28:55Absolutely. I see, in fact, Wendy, let me come back to you after this call, and sorry for bringing the flow right here, but we may have a use case for it, for one of our mobile chip sets. And I'll have a joint with the business unit team come back to you post that

S Speaker 410:12Why am I talking and no one but Hi, Dr. Brandon langwick, so, yeah, so I was been working on with Wendy doing fully homorphic encryption for the last two to three years. So I guess we just run through a few demos. But I guess let me start out by explaining homorphic encryption is generally the ability to encrypt data and keep it secure while still be able being able to perform inferences on it. So even though you don't know what's encrypted, you're able to, you know, kind of add, subtract, multiply and divide, you know, kind of mathematical operations, which are what neural networks basically do. So you can have three set operations performed and get a meaningful output without ever sharing the

S Speaker 115:11So, so we are working with companies who are building super intelligence. You know how companies are now moving ahead, trying to build the latest, greatest super AI. And a company we are working with actually are looking to build safe super AI, kind of like what this guy who left open AI to do. And in order to protect the brain, you need fully homomorphic encryption functioning real time. But even before you get to the super AI in any autonomous vehicle, it's all about CMA model, right? They're looking at the images information coming from the sensors or from the camera, so they can make sense. A hacker in the middle could actually be inject fake data, fake images, or temper images and cause the model to misbehave, and that's why fully homomorphic encryption is really, really important for any autonomous vehicle, a government, something like that. But you really need speed up calculation, and that require how we are accelerating.

S Speaker 116:55Oh, we are going for our zero and we have, we're getting a lot of interest and soft commitment. We're looking for a lead, yeah, so I have a few company that may be the lead investor, so we can negotiate turn sheet, but I'm looking for a lead investor who can really say, Okay, here's my data, and I don't know, does Qualcomm lead or you guys follow?

S Speaker 217:16So yeah, maybe good segue to give you a brief intro about the fund. So our check sizes are usually two to $15 million we are typically a Series A investor, although more recently, we have started doing some seed opportunistically, and then most of our investments, we follow about 20% of our investment. We would lead if we feel there is a strong strategic value that we can add, but we rarely do lead rounds, and we take board observer seats. We more often do not take a board director seat.

S Speaker 120:09don't. We have a cap. Is safe for 2 million? If you're interested in safe, let me know. But when we have a lead, we will close out the safe, because it's coming in and you don't want to give up 20% discount. Absolutely. So I can send you the info. I can send you the same note agreement you can take a look. So I'm going to send you is NBC write up and Brandon, I want to find out what we have on fag right now. We still owe apple. Sorry. Apple was interested.

S Speaker 420:44Still a few write ups, but I was working on updating these timing analysis because of the workstations, so I should be able to finish that today or tomorrow, and then I can get that so I can get that to you this week as well.

S Speaker 223:27Absolutely. Wendy, thank you for this. Appreciate the time today. Let me come back with some follow up questions. Happy to read through the white paper. And let me also send you a note on what the business on mobile business unit is looking at, and if, if you see any parallel for a partnership happy to initiate that right away.

Can you see a parallel already after you saw what we did? So
S Speaker 223:49I do see a potential, and I'll send you a deck about exactly what they're looking at. But I also feel there would be a need for you to sort of speak with the business units and try to see what's the best way to engage. So I will make that initial conversation, but I do see some potential for that, right?

S Speaker 125:30So I will send you a few emails, starting with our white paper in our safe and it will take you from there. Absolutely sounds good. I do want to know a little bit so you are working for the venture. You started that way, or you actually started with Qualcomm, and then

S Speaker 225:49moved to the venture at Qualcomm. I mean, I directly started with the venture arm, so I was in venture capital for about two and a half years. I had a small stint with Menlo Ventures and spend a year with Morpheus ventures in LA and then directly post my MPH ventures in the venture investment arm. Oh, okay,

S Speaker 126:09what kind of investment is Qualcomm mostly interested because when I got an email from you, I was like, interesting. Yeah, I love to talk to them. But what do they see in us? They don't even know where does edge meet?

S Speaker 226:23I kind of figured that out. But apart from that, we invest quite a lot in any technology which can move downstream from the silicon layer that we play at. So if you can imagine, our silicon go into a PCS, mobiles cloud, inferencing platform, a lot of IoT devices, a lot of networking devices, so any downstream software or hardware application which can come from that is where we want to invest in, and that means a lot of AI investments, infrastructure and applications as well. A lot of IoT investments, a lot of industrial automation, computer vision, automobile tech stack, ar, VR, so wide variety, as I would say, and you can possibly get us look at it from our portfolio page.

S Speaker 327:22NBC. Yeah. We're working on a new, essentially, a network layer, that will allow us to take different different protocols and just run them over NPC automatically. And so from the system point of view, it just looks like you've got a new tunnel, and you can just almost like a VPN, and you can run all the apps on it that way, on this way, you don't have to rewrite the applications. You can just run them on this network, and everything gets included with the noise.

S Speaker 127:47And it's not a tunnel, because it's a noise based so it's a lot secure, and it could still be terminating on the other end, but it doesn't have to, it will be reconstructed. So in our view, the technology we have, right, the fully homomorphic encryption, the noise based communication, all started with data. If the data is sealed with Omni seal, you know you're dealing with authenticated data, right, not tempered and not to mention our Omni CEO, we verified that you can see it. Not only you can seal data for training purposes, you can do for inferences, we also verify it concealed the AI model itself, the weights and biases. And so if people attack the AI model by trying to change the weights and biases, we will know right? So this way you will have trustable AI. Otherwise you don't. Today, you don't have trustable AI,
