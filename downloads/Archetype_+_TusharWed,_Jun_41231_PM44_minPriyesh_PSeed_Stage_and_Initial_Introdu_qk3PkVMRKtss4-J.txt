0:38looking forward to
S Speaker 10:41learning how you've progressed over the last two years, and original thesis still the same, or is it different now and then? How it's different? She

S Speaker 20:56had access on different different parts of the perhaps, or of our emphasis on different, different, different parts of it. Okay, hey, Yvonne, but to connect the dots for folks. So Priyesh And I had a good conversation a few weeks back, and he thought we should meet with char as well, and also, if you recall Tushar. We met him almost two years ago, exactly, in Carlos, during the pre seed fund raise. So I think we only regardless. Yeah, remember to showers that you told us it made sense, but was going to be really, really hard,

1:33and you were right.
1:37I clearly remember
S Speaker 11:41what I said. So I remember what I said, Because essentially, my background, a lot of it is in selling to IRP, and then at Qualcomm, we sell to a lot of these customer profiles. And then we've invested over the years, actually now we've invested even more in these spaces, given how strategic it is to
what I said. So I remember what I said, Because essentially, my background, a lot of it is in selling to IRP, and then at Qualcomm, we sell to a lot of these customer profiles.

us. So I understand, I mean, essentially, the question is

us. So I understand, I mean, essentially, the question is
S Speaker 12:09our big learning in just in this space, which is typically, you know, I think the broader term get, that gets used is like IOT is a trillion dollar market, or whatever that number is, but, but it's more about, it's 1000 billion dollar markets or, or maybe 10,000 $100 million markets. So, so then, when you, when you make that statement, that means that selling to one customer is not the same. So the repeatability in this business, how do you reduce sales cycles? How do you reduce POC cycles? How do you reduce like, how do you go sell the same product to 50 different customers for a million dollar contract, right? So those things like, those are the main questions that we typically ask in these spaces. So looking forward to learning, your perspective and your learning, I'm sure you've learned from along the journey. And then, yeah,

S Speaker 33:16I think, I think maybe, look, this is that Brendan hasn't seen, well, something that this candidate there brother hasn't seen that so he'll be excited to see what we're gonna say. But I think what you're saying is very correct. I think it's and that's fundamentally the problem. What we have for gorgeous to solve, that's what you're trying to solve. And we will show the progress which we made. And I think you really need to do it end to end, you know, you can just like piece of it, and because everything has come together, one of those problems, you have to do the whole thing, and that works. But I want to steal, like, I don't like how much you remember about us, you know, like five co founders from Google, yeah,
I think, I think maybe, look, this is that Brendan hasn't seen, well, something that this candidate there brother hasn't seen that so he'll be excited to see what we're gonna say.

S Speaker 34:48the raise after, see, we raised one more million dollar from the Jeff Bezos, he came over and spent a couple of hours with us, and he he was small check. Got it. Got it? Okay, yeah, so, oh, he wants to write more obviously, but we just at that evaluation. Does it make sense for us to take all the money, but we wanted to have a jetty, having Jeff Bezos, I think was very valuable. So again, so I'm going to skip, you know, physically I stuff, I think this is a kind of like, I think basic statement is that, you know, the physical world, rather than sensor data. And I think the biggest problem with which kind of building solutions for it is that most of the data is getting lost and used, like, 70 90% like, just look at data yesterday is wasted because there's ability to build software to run, to build this. This all comes back to your problem. We say, like, you know, custom model is expensive. There's hundreds of sensor types. There's data fragmentation. All the data is different. Like, all sensor types are different. There's a development cycle is very long, Master years, integration, and there's lack of expertise in companies, right? So, so that's kind of like, what locks in the IT market, and as a result, is kind of massive fragmentations. We have to do those use cases, so

S Speaker 16:05that's from a product standpoint. But what about appetite for these customers to pick? Which is these sectors? Have you seen? Because, you know, it all boils down to like the ROI they have to see strong ROIs. And then right is there appetite for these customers to

S Speaker 36:29to pay? We, I think if you come into the right side with the right solution, there is appetite to pay. So what we are coming to them not with the vertical solution. Secretary, what we're saying is saying is saying like, look, we're going to give you a a single model and and a platform which allows you to build all these use cases using this natural language. But we're not coming to them like, Okay, well, this is a model for this use case, a model for that use case. So one of the massive unlock was Erica talked a little bit more like capabilities of our model demonstrates very impressive chrome qualities. To first be able to generalize across multiple sensor types you have, like one data from all the sensors you want number one, and also a capability to interpret this data to the natural language. It's almost like chat GPT for physical world. Data. Three, we build this platform which makes it very easy in terms of go to market perspective. We try to make it reduce friction of deployment as much as we can, so the customers don't have to worry about the protocols and everything is everything comes in one package. That would be, sorry, we build, we build a developer environment where I can, when people can create these use cases with natural language. You can just write using text, just like you do agents now in cloud, and that's how people do this, like with the course right now, and everything else, you just program with natural language. So if you come with that package, and not with one of those solutions. Customers are willing to pay and switch to Brandon to talk some of the traction we have with our customers, I just want to clearly answer

S Speaker 28:10your question was that yes, like we signed a deal with Mercedes for 850k for a six months evaluation of their team, using that platform to build features to demo and vehicle to the CEO we are in procurement now for multi year. AR deals with Comcast entering where the first year land is, you know, between 500 and a million dollars. And then the other folks on that screen there. Those were all paid pilots. Typically think all were all on this slide. So it's for us, it'll be

S Speaker 18:43more from like, how do you go? So that's the my problem statement, which is, yes, paid quite pilots are good. And then we see a lot of paid pilots, even across a lot of our portfolio companies in this space, life size,
more from like, how do you go? So that's the my problem statement, which is, yes, paid quite pilots are good. And then we see a lot of paid pilots, even across a lot of our portfolio companies in this space, life size,

I want to emphasize the replicability of that across these verticals or something. The other part of your question. And then the question is, yes. Well, the question
S Speaker 19:17really is like, how do you go from like these paid pilots to not to a space where you don't have to do paid pilots. I mean, it's almost the realization that we've had, like, one big learning across our IoT portfolio, is, can you sell a product without a paid pilot?

S Speaker 29:42So on that count, we've used these, this first wave, to build the platform product on is describing ring is the first customer where they saw a demo, and they've moved it right to commercial discussions with no paid pilot. Now we get to procurement. Still maybe that flips back pilot structure and so on. But the whole goal of building out this platform that's increasingly self serve has tools of one we'll talk about like like the workbench, this no code interface to quickly try things, building applications with natural language, with some sample data. That's our thesis for how we shorten the sales cycle, and reduce the need for these multi month, months, month pilot, pilots, and get down to very fast trials.

S Speaker 310:29The reason for the paid pilot comes, for the pilots, the reason for the pilots comes is about we identified two reasons. Right is that the model requires training, so almost every AI company needs to collect some data from the customer to fine tune and train the model. Our main unlock was building the model which can zero shot. And it's kind of discovery I would call it, and it's very proprietary to us. Our model is capable to ingest a sensors without training and be able to do basic problems with them without having to fine tune and train the model. So you don't use cutting out. Give you this example, right? Yeah, this an example is, I'll just give you example like this is a demo that demo show the model does, right? So this model now here is very simple tasks, predicting behavior of mechanical system. There is a sensor attached to it with accelerometer. The model has not been trained on accelerometer. I've never seen the pendulum, and it's able to predict chaotic behavior of the pendulum, as long as you can predict the regular behavior of the pendulum. But here, pendulum. But here is be able to predict. You can see a prediction of a chaotic behavior of the pendulum. Zero. Shot, no training. Same model, same model. I give a little bit more polished examples of that same model can predict here, you know, like, okay, periodic stay, periodic motion, whatever it is, a little bit easier. But here you have a gradual settlement of temperature between two, like thermodynamic system, gradually settling down. And again, our code was able to predict zero. Shot never been trained or not. So because our models on physics, we build this unique physics model which can do that. So this is number one unlock, how you can remove pale pilot so you don't need to collect any data anymore. And a second unlock is that, how can you create a environment where customer can experiment with the use cases without having us building the use case for them? And that's why we invested in this platform, which includes all the tools you need running on our data, on their data, on data infrastructure, on a prime, on the cloud, on GCP, on Amazon, everywhere you want. And we build a system of kind of very simple to build agents, which we'll call lenses, because we like could make our own names and not follow the you know, the beaten path. So we do this for this agent called lens, where, fundamentally, by writing a piece of JSON and writing the this very simple language instruction, like here, you can tell the model what you want to do. So you what it does. Agent does. You connect the sense input data. So there's a call here collecting the data input. Can collect multiple sensors just by writing little JSON file you created. You write down an instruction using natural language. You choose processor like specific agent, you know, engine for the engine, and you done. So that's all could be done by the right by the customer. I'll give you example. This is what we do, very

S Speaker 313:49here, for example. This is instruction for the model saying you are an AI assistant, mentoring impacted accelerometer. Inside accelerometer is currently directing time series, motion, made based on information, right? The short sentence on specified topics, and here you have the model. Now be able interpreting motion of this mobile phone and telling like, hey, based on the current reading of the sensor accelerometer, it appears the package is not being mishandled, right? Because this is, this is what you have right now and now the shaking coming in models now can interpret it. So, okay, they serve this at the package. It takes high impact and is mishandled by the area indicated likelihood of damage or loss during trust. And then she stops again, and that's so the model can continuously interpret it. Just so you wrote, basically you build an agent and the buildings, we build a software piece of use cases just by writing instructions to the model. So that's how you eliminate the pilots. Because by making it so easy to build this way with these things that you don't even

S Speaker 317:16slumber J, I can give example. Slumber G and Applied Materials, yeah. So they come into us. I mean, like when we talk about the environment, I mean, it's not the same. We do have to give this to customers. Like you guys figure out how to do this. Some customers want it, but a lot of customers who have a problem, which is, like the cost for us to test their data, build the use case for us. If it's become zero, then it's not a POC, right? So we are ourselves, using this environment and using this model to very rapidly build a proof of existence for those customers. So coming to us, it's like, when horizontal really problem. We have like 20 sensors deep, deep inside the earth. Need to find out what's the state of those senses. We cannot find any solution. Can solve it? Can you do this, and we say, like, that's what we're working right now. So we're going to demonstrate them that our model can detect their sensors, and it's going to be built using our own platform. Because, like, our our, like fuel engineers, spend 10% of the time to build this solution right like, and then what interesting point here is that they are interested in the platform. I think this is where I think these unlocks coming from. Think there's, if you can show them that this actually builds use cases themselves. After that they are. I mean, Brendan, correct me if I'm wrong. A lot of this customers want to see this. You can. You can, how easy this?

S Speaker 320:04it's all the same. Go use this, right? So the platform underneath the tools people to build, whether it's, you know, the entity, data, building stuff and selling to people, or housing people, or we're quickly building proof of concept for some Bucha and then sell it to them. Or we sell the whole platform, and they build like, this is all using the same engine, build custom solutions, follow them. Yeah,
it's all the same. Go use this, right? So the platform underneath the tools people to build, whether it's, you know, the entity, data, building stuff and selling to people, or housing people, or we're quickly building proof of concept for some Bucha and then sell it to them.

S Speaker 120:33that's so yeah, our learning, we've got about, like, I'd say, active portfolio, about 20 odd active portfolios in IoT in this space, our big learning in this space is, I mean, I could be wrong, but learning across The portfolio has been more vertical solutions over platform plays. We've invested in platform companies in this space and then so the reason why is repeatability is because if the education that you have to do for with a platform play in this market, like going back to my first thing, which is this is 10,000 100, million dollar market and and if that's the case, then for platform plays, for each market, you have to do some customization, more hand holding, the repeatability, and then the Sales Team education is hard, because how are you incentivizing the sales, sales people to go build repeatability in their sales pipelines and all of those, right? So, so this is like, I think the your go to market motion. See, I understand you go to market motion. I'm curious if you ever thought about, and if that would work building a more grassroot, community based open source like go after building, you know, hundreds of 1000s of developers, I don't know if even that will work. We've had portfolios who've gone and tried that as well. But if that's something that would work to go faster in this case, because, because otherwise you're going to have these long POC cycles with many of these customers, right? Because it's custom, yeah. I mean, you know, I know you say they want to build it, but it's more hand holding. It's I make the signal, imagine Brandon. Don't get me. I mean, I'm trying to add, like, a direct

that's so yeah, our learning, we've got about, like, I'd say, active portfolio, about 20 odd active portfolios in IoT in this space, our big learning in this space is, I mean, I could be wrong, but learning across The portfolio has been more vertical solutions over platform plays. We've invested in platform companies in this space and then so the reason why is repeatability is because if the education that you have to do for with a platform play in this market, like going back to my first thing, which is this is 10,000 100, million dollar market and and if that's the case, then for platform plays, for each market, you have to do some customization, more hand holding, the repeatability, and then the Sales Team education is hard, because how are you incentivizing the sales, sales people to go build repeatability in their sales pipelines and all of those, right? So, so this is like, I think the your go to market motion. See, I understand you go to market motion. I'm curious if you ever thought about, and if that would work building a more grassroot, community based open source like go after building, you know, hundreds of 1000s of developers, I don't know if even that will work. We've had portfolios who've gone and tried that as well. But if that's something that would work to go faster in this case, because, because otherwise you're going to have these long POC cycles with many of these customers, right? Because it's custom, yeah. I mean, you know, I know you say they want to build it, but it's more hand holding. It's I make the signal, imagine Brandon. Don't get me. I mean, I'm trying to add, like, a direct
S Speaker 322:47conversation. So I think, look, I think this is a feedback we hear from quite a few VCs, to be honest, because people get burned and verticalized on the kind of like all on industrial AI, not before. And the basic right now, the dogma is like the horizontal platform doesn't work. But at the same time, everybody understand that if somebody cracks the horizontal platform your physical world, that's gonna be holy grail. And that's what OpenAI did for natural language processing. There was exactly the same dogma that in natural language and online data, you have to build verticalized natural language solutions and and that was a dogma, right?

S Speaker 123:25So the difference even is, in case of open AI, you spin up a GPU in the cloud, and then you host your own model, and then you make it available to everybody as as a chat interface or as an API interface, right? And then there's no variability in like in the physical world. The biggest problem is physical so.

S Speaker 323:52But I think, I think this is, this is, I will double click on that, because the variability comes from three places, fundamentally, sensor data because it's variable we

S Speaker 224:33the other side of the distribution, I think that's increasing your thinking on Tushar is, what about a world where all of your verticalized IoT investments were customers of Newton, and they didn't all have to run separate and duplicative base model infrastructures and infrastructures like, why should they all have to build models with classical ml versus a thing like Newton?

S Speaker 125:00I'll tell you why they do it. They do it because then they get commoditized versus their competitor. Uh, I've had the conversation with many of our startups, right, like, and then they do it. So one is that second they do it because, so I'll give you an example of one of our portfolio companies do elder care. Fall detection, right? It's a solved problem, right? Fall detection, they do it with like 99.9 and it's better than anybody else and everything, right? Let's find and then do? They do it by running everything on the edge, all of that, right? But by having more control. And then for them, it's not that, it's a lot of other stuff, like building trust in that industry is way bigger than the actual tech, for example. So so they want to own have more control of their destiny and and that's why, like, we have another company called spotty that's doing all these they want to have. I've asked this question to them as well. Right as the world is moving towards these vlms, that one model that does it all. Do you need to build your own models? And then their answer is that we just need a lot more control of our own destiny. We don't want somebody to switch up an API and jeopardize everything, right? Like, yeah,
I'll tell you why they do it. They do it because then they get commoditized versus their competitor. Uh, I've had the conversation with many of our startups, right, like, and then they do it.

S Speaker 226:27vlms, really good comparison. But then the spot AI, they have the resource and expertise to build a VLM and stay competitive, to someone that builds spot with a BLM and competes, no,

S Speaker 126:36I mean, they don't want to, which is, they have enough expertise to take these and know what to do with these in the open source realm. And then in some cases, they'll call an API to open AI, sometimes for things that are more complicated. So your point is that
I mean, they don't want to, which is, they have enough expertise to take these and know what to do with these in the open source realm. And then in some cases, they'll call an API to open AI, sometimes for things that are more complicated. So your point is that

S Speaker 226:55they would still use a VLM. They would take an open source one. They will

they would still use a VLM. They would take an open source one. They will
they would still use a VLM. They would take an open source one. They will
S Speaker 126:59take an open source Yeah, I will pick an open source one, and then do make. They're smart enough to make modifications to it their own use and build, you know, business logic above it. But at the same time, they don't want to buy from somebody else. I mean, they would buy, they would send every now and then they'll make an API call to open AI or anthropic,
take an open source Yeah, I will pick an open source one, and then do make. They're smart enough to make modifications to it their own use and build, you know, business logic above it.

27:31Moving forward, thanks for

S Speaker 127:32so that's, I mean, that's the big
so that's, I mean, that's the big
so that's, I mean, that's the big
so that's, I mean, that's the big
S Speaker 127:41for you, which is, and then the, you know, the indication that I would look for, the indication that I would look for is that that in that chart, if you would have shown like customer, you know, like your traditional, which is, okay, we're signing up this customer for 25 I don't actually, I care less about like these 100,000 $800,000 POCs. That's not a signal to me. To me, the signal is, oh, I've got, you know, 20, $25,000 customers that are that we're already seeing signs of, okay, they're every month, month over month, their usage is increasing. So they've gone from 25 to 30 to whatever right like. So I think that's the and, and we continue to add right like, and continue to add on a monthly basis. This is so that just shows that okay, that the repeatability story, that this product can be used across multiple verticals, multiple companies,
for you, which is, and then the, you know, the indication that I would look for, the indication that I would look for is that that in that chart, if you would have shown like customer, you know, like your traditional, which is, okay, we're signing up this customer for 25 I don't actually, I care less about like these 100,000 $800,000 POCs.

29:03say that this is
S Speaker 329:05kind of like easy sell. Also like for for VCs, because I think you're right. I mean, what you're saying here is we hear quite often, because if this works, it's super it's super attractive, but it just goes against the all the experiences people have in last 20 years on building these companies. So we would like to see more of the proof that you not only can do the model, which can do this stuff, but actually we can sell that model and actually deploy some more that people don't use this stuff. So it's, it's a very, very we hit quite often. So yeah,
kind of like easy sell. Also like for for VCs, because I think you're right.

S Speaker 129:44so what's the like? What's your you're looking to raise? How much are you looking to raise? So
so what's the like? What's your you're looking to raise? How much are you looking to raise? So
so what's the like? What's your you're looking to raise? How much are you looking to raise? So
so what's the like? What's your you're looking to raise? How much are you looking to raise? So
S Speaker 329:49we're looking our anchor balance is 30. We would like to raise 35 we can go down 25 at good condition and but we kind of anchor into 30.
we're looking our anchor balance is 30. We would like to raise 35 we can go down 25 at good condition and but we kind of anchor into 30.

S Speaker 130:00Okay, so 30 and then you, you're looking for a lead, yeah?
Okay, so 30 and then you, you're looking for a lead, yeah?
Okay, so 30 and then you, you're looking for a lead, yeah?
Okay, so 30 and then you, you're looking for a lead, yeah?
S Speaker 330:09Okay, we have a couple of, we have a few folks who kind of, like, excited about the opportunity. And want to bet, I mean, it's a bit of a it's a risk, of course, yeah, everything has been risking. This is life, you know, but again, so I think if these things work, like, if these things work, everybody going to come to us, because it's just, just, there's nobody else to come to from Italy and the so that people like, no. So we have a couple of couple of couple of folks who are interested this. We had a conversation this next week, and we looking for more investors who, you know, like, see an opportunity and want to bet on it. So I think for physical AI companies, our rate for the SaaS companies, maybe our raise is quite large, but physically, our company is quite, quite small. We have, we can, we can run very economical, economically and very, very tight business.
Okay, we have a couple of, we have a few folks who kind of, like, excited about the opportunity. And want to bet, I mean, it's a bit of a it's a risk, of course, yeah, everything has been risking.

S Speaker 131:11Yeah. See, you don't have a hardware component. So you don't have a hardware component, so you can raise 35 and then the risk maybe, what, two, three years, is that what you're thinking, yeah, so
Yeah. See, you don't have a hardware component. So you don't have a hardware component, so you can raise 35 and then the risk maybe, what, two, three years, is that what you're thinking, yeah, so
Yeah. See, you don't have a hardware component. So you don't have a hardware component, so you can raise 35 and then the risk maybe, what, two, three years, is that what you're thinking, yeah, so
Yeah. See, you don't have a hardware component. So you don't have a hardware component, so you can raise 35 and then the risk maybe, what, two, three years, is that what you're thinking, yeah, so
S Speaker 331:25two, three years. So we do have, I mean, again. So everything you're saying is, is, is we completely see where you're coming from, completely understand your hesitation or, like, risky thing. And the goal for us is to do to de risk those risks, you know, and maybe, like, of course, like we were looking at the entire physical industries making this big, you know, big statement, 80% of the world economy. But I think what's going to happen, and I think it's happening already now, is that we will, we have it right now, sort of champions of our champion, kind of categories of businesses, I think we'll we will probably focus on those for now, but we also preserve the horizontality of the platform. We don't want to become like oil and gas exploration company or automotive company or humanitarian company, but we have the biggest, biggest tractions from smart homes and smart like, smart homes, smart cities, smart offices, like, just to have a lot of data already, and they need to merge it to get into one representation which you can understand what's going on. Like, this is a huge, huge look for that. And the second one is you have manufacturing, like a mod slumber gears, which have tons of sensor data, and they need to figure it out, like how to use it efficiently. So this is, this is two big customer looking. We probably will have enough focusing. I think we need to take it all the way. I agree. We're going to take it in the last three years, we're going to take it all the way to deployment and see the growth and see the use and make sure it's successful.
two, three years. So we do have, I mean, again. So everything you're saying is, is, is we completely see where you're coming from, completely understand your hesitation or, like, risky thing.

S Speaker 132:58Yeah, I agree. I think that those are right steps for for us. We early. I'll tell you why, because we have a pretty big hierarchy portfolio and and then we the signals that we look for, I know it won't work for our team,
Yeah, I agree. I think that those are right steps for for us. We early. I'll tell you why, because we have a pretty big hierarchy portfolio and and then we the signals that we look for, I know it won't work for our team,
Yeah, I agree. I think that those are right steps for for us. We early. I'll tell you why, because we have a pretty big hierarchy portfolio and and then we the signals that we look for, I know it won't work for our team,
Yeah, I agree. I think that those are right steps for for us. We early. I'll tell you why, because we have a pretty big hierarchy portfolio and and then we the signals that we look for, I know it won't work for our team,
33:27but you're looking
S Speaker 333:29for the repeated sales, the growth. I mean
for the repeated sales, the growth. I mean
for the repeated sales, the growth. I mean
for the repeated sales, the growth. I mean
S Speaker 133:32repeatability, like in that, like not POCs, which is, does that? Can you sell this? So I'll tell you like, there's been I, I've tried to find a lot of data points across the industry, not just in our own portfolio, right? It just hasn't happened. So now I'm not gonna like, so this is something that I think at some point after the fund raise, or something you should probably think about, okay, so I can, I mean, in just for data points, for you, like, there's, there's several portfolios that we've had in the past. Like, we've, like, one of our portfolios, particle, particle had this, you know, the idea was to build Arduino, or for with a better software and everything for these larger enterprise customers, right? The one of the things that they started noticing is like, oh, when you go to horizontal, any one customer that tries to become big, they actually want to go build their own in this space. So, so then, then they had to go build, like three vertical products and what have you right. So it was, and then this is edge impulse. Was one company that we recently bought, right, right.

35:59So the problem? What is the problem? Then
So the problem? What is the problem? Then
So the problem? What is the problem? Then
So the problem? What is the problem? Then
S Speaker 336:02what? So their problem you and what? What was their problem? Their problem was repeatability, or
what? So their problem you and what? What was their problem? Their problem was repeatability, or
what? So their problem you and what? What was their problem? Their problem was repeatability, or
what? So their problem you and what? What was their problem? Their problem was repeatability, or
S Speaker 136:07it's just, yeah, repeatability didn't happen. And then the question is, so no repeatability is like, what you see, right? But what's the original? Like, why is there no repeatability? Right? Like, why is there no repeatability? What's the what's the biggest?
it's just, yeah, repeatability didn't happen. And then the question is, so no repeatability is like, what you see, right? But what's the original? Like, why is there no repeatability? Right? Like, why is there no repeatability? What's the what's the biggest?

S Speaker 136:27It's just that you're not the pain point for many of these customers, it's there, but it's not big enough. Let's see the pain point for these customers. It's almost so the it's the decision maker, which is, you talk to the engineers, the engineers at these companies will all say, this is a big, main problem, right? But the decision makers are either the head of operations or either the head of finance, right? You go talk to these head of finance and he head of operations people. They say, You know what? In most of these industries, the budget approvals happens once or twice a year, and then whenever there's budget approvals happen. It's not like, you know, in the technology industries, which is, you can swipe a credit card whenever you want, right? It's mostly these budget approval cycles. You have to wait for these budget approval cycles, and then these budget approval cycle when they come the list is like, you know, 10 different things. And then they're only going to approve the top three. So these typically don't fall under top three. Is it a nice Yeah, but it's a must have. No,
It's just that you're not the pain point for many of these customers, it's there, but it's not big enough. Let's see the pain point for these customers.

37:29I see, right? So,
S Speaker 137:33so that's and then these are low margin businesses, Legacy businesses, where people that are making the decision, they don't really understand it, hopefully, so so they don't fully understand the value of this thing as well. So it's it boils down to actually, I would, I would recommend you to talk to actually the decision, the final decision makers, right, rather than the heads of engineering and these things,
so that's and then these are low margin businesses, Legacy businesses, where people that are making the decision, they don't really understand it, hopefully, so so they don't fully understand the value of this thing as well.
