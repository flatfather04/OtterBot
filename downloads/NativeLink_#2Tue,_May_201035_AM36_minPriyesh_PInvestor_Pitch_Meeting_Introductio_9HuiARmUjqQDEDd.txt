S Speaker 10:00A principal engineer on iCloud, current generation of iCloud, he left a very lucrative salary to work for us for minimum wage and stock. Okay, I'm a little more than minimum wage now, but he did that for eight months just to get the right mindset and and and myself, you know, I built MongoDB, first AI infrastructure product. I turned their failing search business into a thriving search business.

And this was when Marcus
S Speaker 10:33I did. I started working on vector search stealthily in 2020, before anyone knew what a vector database is, or most people knew how vectors were so important to machine learning and AI and it was launched in private preview in 2022 in June of 2022 by building it kind of loudly 2021 and before I built the company on MongoDB that's owned by Newell brands. So I don't take a salary. I mean, the California regulators make me take minimum wage, but like, yeah, I don't need it. Like, I'm an LP in a few funds. One of those funds is an investor in us. The other two. I told no, because they're just collecting beads. They're not actually doing venture. I'm not investing in the next one for sure. Yeah,

1:32it's good though. What are your investors,
it's good though. What are your investors,
it's good though. What are your investors,
it's good though. What are your investors,
S Speaker 11:33though? So, I mean, we have a bunch. We have the best one I think, is verisimo, that it's like our partners, like a former Andreessen and Sequoia co founder, CTO verissimo. This like based in Indy. It's based in Israel and New York City. Okay, yeah, and then we have a small check from Sequoia. I at Bogle meal. And then we also have integral ventures, which is, I mean, I'm an investor in that fund. That fund is crushing it. It's like my best performing fund by far, is that, right? What's the integral integral ventures? Yeah, crushing it. Absolutely crushing. This a woman from Taiwanese American like early data, dog employee, just like so scrappy. We'll get to anybody. So good, so good. And then we also have Wellington, which is like I had a different view of Wellington from the outside and from like, knowing about their involvement in MongoDB. Like, Wellington is like this. They're just not really tool most of them are not tooled for early stage investing.

Well, how do you say her name?
S Speaker 13:21Stephanie, sure, sure. Oh, how do you spell it here? This is her, I'll send you the form d link or something. Yeah. I mean, I, I know it's real because I got the LP docs from Gunderson, and they definitely took the money out in the capital costs.
Stephanie, sure, sure. Oh, how do you spell it here? This is her, I'll send you the form d link or something. Yeah. I mean, I, I know it's real because I got the LP docs from Gunderson, and they definitely took the money out in the capital costs.

S Speaker 24:17a little bit about like so it seems you started a company in 2023, after, and this was right after MongoDB. Yeah,
a little bit about like so it seems you started a company in 2023, after, and this was right after MongoDB. Yeah,
a little bit about like so it seems you started a company in 2023, after, and this was right after MongoDB. Yeah,
a little bit about like so it seems you started a company in 2023, after, and this was right after MongoDB. Yeah,
S Speaker 14:25like I left MongoDB and started this the next day. Oh, okay, actually, it's not totally accurate. I announced that I was starting it. I I had a foster child that I eventually adopted. She was homeless in my neighborhood, and then when she went to the Fauci system, she was bouncing around a bunch like no one wanted her, and I finally got her. MongoDB did not. MongoDB did not want me to do this. It was actually the best thing I've ever done for my life. So weird. But like she and I cruise up with my in laws, up the up the Rhine, and we also, like, toured Paris, and it was a lot of fun. She had her own cabin. She thought that she was on a Titanic. I was like, You're not gonna
like I left MongoDB and started this the next day. Oh, okay, actually, it's not totally accurate. I announced that I was starting it. I I had a foster child that I eventually adopted.

Oh, that's interesting. Okay, so, and then how big is a team? Now it's
Oh, that's interesting. Okay, so, and then how big is a team? Now it's
5:32like 10 people, I believe. Okay,
like 10 people, I believe. Okay,
like 10 people, I believe. Okay,
like 10 people, I believe. Okay,
S Speaker 15:39so we have a couple people in Germany, yeah, trying to move them to Switzerland, just because Switzerland is more compatible with private equity, like data. Germany is just the laws. Like, we can't scale that team too much because the laws. But they said, they say, Oh, those are great laws. This is why we live here. It's like the tracks talent, like whatever. Man, it's fine. I'll deal with it. But we're about to add
so we have a couple people in Germany, yeah, trying to move them to Switzerland, just because Switzerland is more compatible with private equity, like data. Germany is just the laws.

6:07I can come. I mean, I can
I can come. I mean, I can
I can come. I mean, I can
I can come. I mean, I can
S Speaker 16:10go to wherever, anywhere, wherever anyone is. So I got confused because someone sent me a text, and I can come to the office to get the monitor. I don't know an engineer who's in Mountain View. I'm in Palo Alto, so I can come get the monitor, but let me put my on. Do not disturb it. Should do it automatically. But I don't know if it's connected to zoom. So basically, we have one person that we're going to hire in Bangalore, and like, 10 days he starts. I mean, he is so incredible. I'm so glad we found him. People like, times have changed. Like, one of my co founders of my first business is from Hyderabad, originally, IIT. I mean, this man is off the grid now. He's like, I'm wealthy, I don't need to do anything. Yeah, he moved back to Hyderabad, but he told me, when he got to it and never seen a computer. There was not one in his village. He moved back to where he grew up. That place is called High Tech City. Today, the one has changed, and I think that the view, I mean, there are people in Bangladesh, because anywhere in the world, 1000s, even, and so, like, we landed this one engineer who was working at, like, a big company in the US, based in the US, like, and they just gave him garbage work. And he's like, this is real work, and he's probably gonna be the third most talented engineering company. Talented 22 and so I see, I see a lot of growth opportunity there. We also see, like, growth opportunity with potential customers there as well. The

S Speaker 17:36they're very intense. I mean, we did a small deal with a company called Phone pay. Oh yeah. And, like, they put us into the ringer for that, but the idea was just to get on the approved vendor list. We're going to expand our scope. And I think by the end of the year, they could be, like, 150 $200,000 customer. And I mean, we have a $2 million opportunity with a Malaysian slash Vietnamese company. Why? Like, building hardware with open AI, and this, like, really, really exciting. They want to compete with Qualcomm, honestly, they're like, you know, we started off as the CM, we're moving up the stack, like we have a few different products, customers are buying them, and the American incumbents are sleeping.

S Speaker 28:13I mean, is, it'll be interesting how, like, you know, as you know, like, the world of semiconductor, of course, will also get disrupted. With the speed at which we we build semiconductor will get disrupted, I think, and then this is where the incumbents will be slow to act, and new players will be faster to act. But challenge, I think it's just the supply chains of building semiconductor are so challenging to navigate, and I think that it's relatively harder than like software companies, but, but I do see I agree. I mean, that's why we continue to look at companies that are

S Speaker 19:11technologies used to build software over the past 30 years were to solve a problem from 30 years ago. That that's the simple answer, right? And like So Java is pervasive, and, like the JVM runtime is pervasive, and Docker containers are pervasive. But there are new ways and new capabilities and new technologies to exploit that give customers more determinism and greater scalability and the and more flexibility, frankly, like our customers have come from. I mean, they were paying Xilinx, they were paying cadence, they were paying synopsis. They were paying answers like most of these companies I'd never heard of. I mean, I knew Xilinx because one of my co founders of my first business was an executive at Xilinx, and then I knew cadence because lip buo is an investor in our company. But like the other ones, I kind of knew what they were like. I knew they were public companies, but I didn't know anything about them. And companies have said that, you know, we kick off certain runs like where we're trying to simulate material properties and an environment and trying to understand causal relationships between some of these ambitions that we have and reality. And we kick off those runs on Thursday and check the results Monday morning. I said, That is ridiculous. Yeah, this way to work. And so, like I remember I asked one, one company in Korea, this is a great company. I said, What did the engineers do on Friday? He said,

S Speaker 111:08like, I think that team is just shooting the shit, like they're not doing anything. And so we, and this is not Samsung, this is a different company, but Samsung, we took a process that took two to three days and turned it into a one to two hour workflow. So you can imagine, or what, for Samson. So this was for validating operating system software before sending it out to a fleet of, like, 1.4 billion devices.
like, I think that team is just shooting the shit, like they're not doing anything.

11:38phones and TVs. Yeah,
phones and TVs. Yeah,
phones and TVs. Yeah,
phones and TVs. Yeah,
S Speaker 211:39Android phones. And then, and then, over there, so switches, this is Android build that you're validating, and then you're validating that for
Android phones. And then, and then, over there, so switches, this is Android build that you're validating, and then you're validating that for

S Speaker 111:53different phone variants. So they have such a large they have such a large fleet, yeah, yeah, that they have to, like their their supply chain has to be diverse, like they have to get a few parts from some places. They even have to keep a few places warm and get some parts from them, just because, in case, there's a failure at this other place, they can ramp up with this one quickly. And then they have some regulations. I didn't even know this, that, like China, will make them buy a certain proportion of Huawei devices before they deliver. And so like Samsung has to navigate an extremely complex supply chain, far more complex than like Ford. I saw Ford and thought Ford was like, I'm like, this will outlive the dollar. Now I'm not so sure, because, you know, electric vehicles take a lot fewer parts and are a lot less complex, and the semiconductor and the electric, the complex electronics, advanced electronics, are far more complex and and so, yeah, we validate on all these different variants. So I think it's like 2400 different total variants, and they run this validation across all of them. Then, secondarily, that's one the like. There's another team at Samsung that's doing Silicon Photonics that wants to that, you know, I think they want to get an industry leading yield. I mean, Samsung's yield is falling across all their different segments. That three nanometer yield is like 10 to 15% and so they are exploring, if these new tools and new approaches like and they're really adopting the approach pioneered at Google, like Google makes the TPU with a system called Forge, which is very similar to natively and and so they're like, well, maybe there's a possibility that we can augment our capabilities. Like, we're not getting all that much from like. So how
different phone variants.

S Speaker 113:58very similar to the other use cases, which is, you, you have to build a tool chain. And then once that tool chain exists, customers supply the code that they want to parallelize the execution of So I recently, for one of our customers, like I needed to, I needed to work all weekend, wrestling with wrestling with LLVM and G Lip C, because they have some bespoke requirements. Like, I don't always have to do this, but I did this week. I kind of did it because, like, my team had been working really hard all weekend, and I wanted them to know, like, I mean, the founder will also work real hard, you know what? I mean, where is this? So this is, yeah, Marcus. This is me remote execution. So I wrote this remote execution image. So basically, this is, this is for a streaming engine, and C Plus Plus that will replace all of confluent. I mean, red panda is replacing confluent so fast

S Speaker 115:30that they are going to be probably worth $50 billion because it's so important. So it's a high value use case. But they also need us. They all need us. So I built this tool chain. This takes hours the first time. Then I built like a layer on top of it, just for their ease of use, because that's how they work. Then you modify, like you just follow the instructions on our app so a customer this is the same for semiconductors, it's actually all quite similar. So they had copied this,

I can't do this forever. But like, there, there are other people in the company who who are also very strong in this domain, and then you just run the build. Or sometimes it's like, you'd probably the test value rather than the build value, the test invocation.

Like, that's how I that's how I know the phone pay folks and the blue car people like, we're good. I spent a lot of time in Chennai. I almost married a girl from Punjab, and my veterans friend is from Nasik. So that's awesome, yeah. So, but then this other, this other person that you're going to see is a guy named David Barr. He's a Principal Engineer at Samsung. He lives in Suwon C he is a part of an elite team. I wish I could show you on the back of my computer, I have these VIP stickers. When you go there, they take your laptop and put it in Faraday cage I infiltrated that got to this floor. This is

S Speaker 519:35So would you just link as, like, simulate, simulate. What sounds more relevant, like a simulation infrastructure tool or a remote execution backend tool, like, what do you,
So would you just link as, like, simulate, simulate. What sounds more relevant, like a simulation infrastructure tool or a remote execution backend tool, like, what do you,

So would you just link as, like, simulate, simulate. What sounds more relevant, like a simulation infrastructure tool or a remote execution backend tool, like, what do you,
S Speaker 419:48I mean in terms of my, of our immediate needs, then the current capability is addressing those. And so as a I mean, it's, yeah, I guess it's like combination, right? It's the whole shebang execution plus caching, and that all the pieces that you need in order to create your infrastructure that scales. Yeah,
I mean in terms of my, of our immediate needs, then the current capability is addressing those. And so as a I mean, it's, yeah, I guess it's like combination, right?

S Speaker 421:20we have some kind of mixed workload. We need to do some GPU stuff. Do some GPU stuff, intensive stuff, etc. Like, you have a hard time getting individual kids hardware that would do well, of all those things, you know, if you can split stuff and and push them to where work is done more effectively, then that'll scale better.

21:57But like at the extreme end,
But like at the extreme end,
But like at the extreme end,
But like at the extreme end,
S Speaker 422:01basically, like running, running the original stuff on specialized hardware without any acceleration at all, versus the sort of segmented solution using native link. Basically, I think we're looking at the scale of the process originally taking like two or three days and getting down to about an hour. Yeah, an hour two hours. So that's the kind of overall
basically, like running, running the original stuff on specialized hardware without any acceleration at all, versus the sort of segmented solution using native link.

S Speaker 222:46and so. So how do people like how do you, how do you deploy it? Samsung, for example, do
and so. So how do people like how do you, how do you deploy it? Samsung, for example, do

S Speaker 122:51you so for them? Because they also they test on so many proprietary systems that they don't even want to give to AWS or GCP that they don't trust them. They it's, it's in a few data centers around the world. So it's in the UK. I mean, it's mostly in Korea, but I think it is they also have it in the UK. They have team members in the US, UK, Australia, Bangladesh, India. They even have a few team members in China. But this, this data centers. There's two, I believe, in Korea, and maybe a small deployment, and the UK and all the engineers just interface with these clusters and

S Speaker 123:44Yeah, so our job is to get really sticky and into the most critical points of businesses. So we have an open source repo. We have a Helm chart that we deploy. Our Helm chart has some proprietary, closed source code, and then our UI is entirely closed source. And so, yeah, that is how we get in, through them. And then they, we become critical to their business, and then we pounce. We should do $2 million with them. So I'm going to Korea probably next week. I wasn't expected. But like, they need to upgrade.

S Speaker 124:26so so, like, we have over 500 companies in our cloud and our managed service, like, in our SAS, but we haven't turned on monetization because it wasn't the priority. In fact, some of the experienced open source investors told us not to. They said, Get usage. Like, prioritize usage is the big one, telling me that. And And now, now, like, just since we've started to turn on, like text to experiment with monetization has been really good. Like, companies just threw out a price to me. They're like, 40k per engineer. That's what we pay. Answers. I was like, what? And so we did. We signed one contract to that effect, we have another company that's going to bring their TCV. There's a 48k

S Speaker 125:20I mean, 108k and, you know, I showed you this repo that I worked on over the weekend, just briefly, like they're probably going to be 202 50 in our cloud. So like, things are moving, but we need to scale, like the engineering around just being able to support that with robustness. So, yeah, like, this is me 12 hours ago. But like, yeah, that this one is going to be probably, I would guess, 203 so far. And then we have some robotics companies that, like, easily could Eclipse one and a half million dollars in our cloud this year. And some more, like the semiconductor company in Malaysia, and they're in the one to $2 million range. They haven't walked out the number yet. And so the C suite there, by the way, like they found us, they said, Look, we manufacture the TPU. We know how it's made. We and

S Speaker 126:34500 companies in our cloud, yeah, which is crazy, yeah. And my friend's company went into the series B, and they had less revenue than we have now, they had probably, like, 280 companies in their cloud. So, but, yeah, this is the effect of the iCloud architect is building our cloud so it's kind of resilient scales and like, by the way, we can juice that, we can grow. We can growth hack all we want. We've just been very prescriptive about we want the highest value use cases. Like, if we got to an NDA stage, I could tell you about some of our other companies. Like, our newest signed agreement from this week is, like, one of the most ambitious companies you've ever heard of.

28:16it could be higher than that.
it could be higher than that.
it could be higher than that.
it could be higher than that.
S Speaker 128:21It could be as high, realistically, it could be as high as two and a half million. That's if, like, one of our key robotics customers is still kind of in the implementation validation phase. If things are, we'll be on pace for two and a half million actually booked and received.
