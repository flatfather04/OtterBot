S Speaker 10:00Do you prove this? The cost curves going down that you saw is basically the same thing as the number of people coming down. So for example, if we double from 125 stores or even 10x, you go to 1000 stores, you don't go to 440 people. Like if I have to cost instead of 400, you have 200 people because now it's one person for the six stores. My goal is to ultimately later down the road get to one person for 100 stores. But it's the same proportionality is the cost per item shift a different way to see the same cost? Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

S Speaker 10:56exactly right. I'm gonna use that more. Exactly. Actually, I'll tell you this. The, during the last, like maybe six months, shown the head of operations five 50% of the team in India. And we've increased the number of items by more than 40%. And and on top of that, the idle time of these guys that are still there, just increased. So you can see how the tech is automating a lot of their work. And Shawn kind of fire everyone all the time. So it's kind of a race between tech getting better and in getting the right number of people. Yeah, very good.

S Speaker 32:08I think it's a false alarm, the headline the other day, but brioche, you wanna you want to wrap this up for me? Yeah. I'm so curious about the deployment. How long does it take to deploy with cost? It's the biggest has obviously, some implication on scaling how fast we can scale. Right. Jamie, thank you so much. Everything's okay. Thank you. It's gone. It's gone. So the modules

S Speaker 12:34so so sometimes, and as a manager may go on site, but typically only on big projects, like danger dome, we have an SI manager, like David waffle was there, but we don't we're not doing any deployment. I mean, we hire different companies to do that. So yeah, it's all said partners. Okay.

S Speaker 32:57Very good. Really. Appreciate JB, I will send a note to to you, Fabio and, Steve, we have a call with our team on Monday. I think it would be good to talk a little bit about this summit. Some of these questions cover some of these questions, you know, at a higher level, obviously. And I think it would also be exciting if you could maybe try to summarize sort of the some of the technology aspects of the internet domain because I think, you know, it's pretty exciting. There's a lot of stuff you know, as you guys said, It's Super Bowl, right? If this goes well, then, you know, we should see a lot of other stuff.
