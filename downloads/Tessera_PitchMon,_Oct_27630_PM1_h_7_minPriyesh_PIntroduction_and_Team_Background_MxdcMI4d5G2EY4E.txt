And there we host a lot of models, infra companies, all the tooling companies across, say, data cleaning to evaluations, to retraining the model, things like that, and expose this to our own developer audience who want to build AI applications or agentic applications on top of our own silicon. So we have some of those efforts going on. Just wanted to mention that,

West Bridge. Led the unicorn round West Bridge capital. You probably have heard of sumir and Mantan and yeah. So they did our series B, and also the series D unicorn number theory.

just building the team out.
just building the team out.
S Speaker 214:33It was rewarding in every, every, every possible way, financially as well as you know, just the joy of building something, creating something, instead of sustaining. And, you know, in a big company, last year, I took a break. I turned 50 last year, and I I took a break full one year, went for a 10 day silent meditation with Asana and all that. Oh, wow. And this year, then I started back. I said, Hey, I want to do again, another startup as early as possible, right? So, so met a dozen different startups in Jan, Feb, March, and zeroed down on Tera. The reason I zero down on Casera, number one reason I could very immediately recognize the market problem and the market problem is Priyesh fortune, 500 companies over the years have invested in best of breed ERP systems. So companies, companies like GE, for example, has 13 different ERPs across all their businesses and business processes, 60% of GES real estate enterprise real estate, meaning enterprise business processes are on SAP. 40% is on Oracle. And then they have multiple instances of saps and EP SAP and Oracle, yeah, then they have a point solutions. Someone like a Thermo Fisher has 100 different ERPs, because they have grown through acquisitions over the years, right? Qualcomm is big in Oracle, but I see now SAP is also, you know, doing something there, right? Yes, you know your typical business process like order to cash, cuts across multiple ERP packages, customer master is sitting both in Salesforce as well as in safety finance. You know, procure to pay again. Cuts through business processes lead to cash. These are some terms that are used in the ERP one and what, what typically happens is between 60 to 80% of a company's budget, which is the CIO budget, is spent in just maintaining these legacy applications, keeping them together, making sure the customization at a code level is up to date, making sure the data is harmonized and cleaned up across these different systems, or everyone is going to snowflake data breaks. So pulling data from all of these system of records to take them, take it to a database. All of this requires a lot of manual projects, and all projects are done by the livestock cadge and I Accenture Infosys. Yes, this is 10s of billions of dollars really spent
It was rewarding in every, every, every possible way, financially as well as you know, just the joy of building something, creating something, instead of sustaining.

S Speaker 217:43What this does is, this does not allow them to to invest, actually, in AI. One of the biggest problems of AI adoption and real AI adoption, not the copilot that every engineer can use, is these systems are still running on as 400 or mainframes? Yeah. I mean, it's very hard to embed AI into the business process. So, so for me, number one reason was our promise with this gen AI platform is we can accelerate this transformation from legacy to modern stack, right? We can. We can accelerate this by 3040, 50% in terms of timelines, we can reduce the technical risk involved. We can reduce the spend that that goes about. So the market opportunity is real, something that I was part of in my role at Capgemini on the other side. Second is as far up said. We have two co founders. One is Kabir. Kabir is a PhD in AI from UC San Diego. He did his PhD pretty young. He finished it when he was 20.

Yes, Jay was mentioning that that's incredible, for sure.
Yes, Jay was mentioning that that's incredible, for sure.
Yes, Jay was mentioning that that's incredible, for sure.
S Speaker 218:57He was with meta as a research scientist for a few months before doing the startup, while he was doing his PhD, he was working full time at Netflix in the ML content generation team. He also did a stint with Apple CD team when he was, I think, 15 years old or 16 years old during his undergrad days. So he's, he's the face of the company, and we are all very, very clear in the company, that is the face of the company, is the, is the Mark Zuckerberg for us, for the for the business, you know, B to B multi. Our other co founder is Ming Chang. Ming is x SAP, okay, so he spent 15 years with SAP in their max attention team, which works with the most complex and biggest SAP clients called they Max attention is called when the SAP systems performance goes down at Apple, at Nvidia, in the largest you know SAP client, yes, so, So between both of them, they have the right combination to build a product. One with the business process. ERP, understanding. Second is with the AI, understand, right? So, so that's how you know that's number two, right. Number one, does the market opportunity exist? Number two, is the team, right? And, and do we have something which is a painkiller versus versus a vitamin? Yeah, because that's always in yardstick. In startup world, we we say, Are you selling a painkiller or a vitamin? And in this case, this is the value can be realized in hard dollars. So and it is. It is something that every CIO, everyone that we present, the reason we are in 3040, fortune, 500 companies, is before we even start presenting the customer is, is, is asking for something like this. When we ask them about their challenges, they are, they're talking about this without even be presenting what we are building, right? And third, of course, is the foundation capital. Is someone I worked with in the past at Turing. Yes, they are the one who introduced me. They are the one who introduced me, Ashu and Jaya. So I know that we have solid backing in terms of investors, right? So my three reasons, I joined them on first of April, employee number three, after Kabir and Ming. Yeah, the team has grown after that. I'll pause here and pull out the presentation, but please ask questions. Absolutely.

22:57year transformation.
S Speaker 123:01Let's and maybe you'll come to this, Prakash, but when you say integrating ERPs at the time of m and A's, are you actually integrating the databases the ERPs, or are you actually just creating an orchestration layer on top of it, and, say, providing an interface to chat with both the ERPs at the same time.
Let's and maybe you'll come to this, Prakash, but when you say integrating ERPs at the time of m and A's, are you actually integrating the databases the ERPs, or are you actually just creating an orchestration layer on top of it, and, say, providing an interface to chat with both the ERPs at the same time.

S Speaker 223:23So, so I walk you through, so the chat interface and the orchestration layer is part of the product, yeah, which, which, I'll walk you through, but, but in a typical roll up of ERPs, two different ERPs as part of MNA, what happens is, so let's say real example synopsis is acquiring answers. Both the companies are on SAP. They both have their custom SAP instances. So what's going to happen now is, as part of the MNA activity, and integrating both the IT systems. They want to, they want to evolve into one single SAP instance. One way to look at it simple is, you know, I am acquiring answers. I am synopsis. I'm going to use my instance, which means that I have to retire the answers SAP instance, I have to retire it, which means I have to migrate all the business processes to what I have implemented it. I might generate invoices in a certain way, but yeah, in was doing invoices in a certain way, all the data that is sitting in answers might have been in a certain field type. So I will have to map all the data and move it to my current instance. All the custom code, they might have customization, which means above SAP, above code, I have to, I have to rewrite those customizations, because I'm also, I'm also doing a transformation of the business process, yeah. So, so the end result of the NRA is that the the the answers, SAP system is completely dismantled. So, so in that context, there is no orchestration layer. You know, one year from now, there will be only one instance, which is the synopsis instance of SAP, because otherwise you end up paying license fee for SAP. Got it. If you, if you run two instances, you are going to pay license fee, extra infra cost, and all of that. So, so the idea is to reduce that. As far as the product is concerned, we have the I think that's what you saw in
So, so I walk you through, so the chat interface and the orchestration layer is part of the product, yeah, which, which, I'll walk you through, but, but in a typical roll up of ERPs, two different ERPs as part of MNA, what happens is, so let's say real example synopsis is acquiring answers.

S Speaker 227:13So, so for the first six weeks, back in April, we started by talking to a few sis, we very quickly realized that this is not going to work. The sis one is they're not very interested in cannibalizing their own business unless they are forced by the client.

S Speaker 227:41They also are not best positioned to represent us and our value to the client. Yeah. Also, some of them have an ambition to build something like this in house, which is great. They should all do it. They should have done it in before we thought about it.

S Speaker 228:03so what we did was we decided to go on our own to Fortune 500 after that initial four week period. And we we are able to resonate directly much better with the CIOs in the Fortune 500 world, like Archana, for example. You know very quickly that this is, this is something we are not ready with Oracle. So the conversation with archna did not go far, and we agreed to circle back when we are ready with Oracle.

S Speaker 230:10sense, yeah, we don't want middle man. We are okay. Si is being a finder, getting a finder's fee and, you know, referral program, right? But not make sense. Likes us. SAP loves us. So SAP is taking us to some of their clients because SAP sees value. SAP wants all their clients to move to the latest and the greatest version, right? And barrier is, is the cost of these upgrades, which, which the SIS. Have not done much about the SIS. Want to deploy more. People want to build more versus our goal is like

S Speaker 130:48and Prakash, do you just, just from a market perspective? I'm curious to hear about it. Do you see a lot of, say, tailwinds, in terms of just SAP? I was reading about it. They announced that they will reduce their updates and support for the old versions by 2027 Do you see market tailwind sort of affecting that

S Speaker 231:10because of that? Yeah. That is why we are more busy with SAP. That is the reason we chose to do SAP before Oracle. Okay, so that was the first, the first decision year ago, when Kabir and Ming started this was, let's pick up SAP, because SAP has a hard deadline of 2027 and they will. They extended warranty to 2030 got it
because of that? Yeah. That is why we are more busy with SAP. That is the reason we chose to do SAP before Oracle.

34:52So, this is, this is the, let me spend some time.
So, this is, this is the, let me spend some time.
So, this is, this is the, let me spend some time.
So, this is, this is the, let me spend some time.
S Speaker 234:54So, so this is the, you know, concept. The concept is each of the agent is an open source, large language model that is trained on the standard data model of SAP. It has been trained on various custom business processes scenarios that that a typical, you know, fortune 500 company will use it for so the models are trained on SAP legacy version, ecc, SAP S for HANA. We are training the models now in the future, on Oracle, on prem version, because the data models have changed and standard business processes that come out of the box has changed in each of these functions, we will continue to train it on. You know, various other enterprise apps like PLM. You might have heard of product life cycle management, which is which is used in manufacturing companies. So some of our clients have told us, hey, train, I'm using wind chill from parametric technologies, BTC, I want you to train an agent, because my bill of material for manufacturing is initially designed in a PLM, and then it moves so. So our our mission is really to to have agents trained on all standard ERPs that the typical enterprise use. Some of our clients have built custom applications which are very business critical to them. So we will, we will also train an agent on their custom business application. Then there is orchestration layer and a user interface. This entire platform is deployed on prem, yeah, at the lead. So this is not an optic, this is not an open AI. Your data never leaves the customer private cloud. It's cloud agnostic. So this can work in AWS, as your GCP, any environment, right? So we bring this pre trained agent AI framework once we deploy in the client environment in a matter of a week or two, these agents will then also crawl through your custom implementation of SAP and learn and create a you know, under good understanding of how you have customized sap in your organization and and then both your technical teams and business teams can start using this product to run all kinds of ongoing operations, migrations, upgrades, integrations, things like that. So that's really, you know, the idea, it's, it's, it's step one, pre training the platform. And this training has to be ongoing, because SAP will come with new updates. So ongoing, deploy it, fine tune it, or trade it to your custom instance, and then start using it. It touches all three aspects. One is custom code, second is data, and third is business processes and configurations. So it operates at all three levels.
So, so this is the, you know, concept. The concept is each of the agent is an open source, large language model that is trained on the standard data model of SAP.

S Speaker 138:00Prakash, I would like to double click on a couple of things here. And very, very interesting slide, right?

S Speaker 239:54So we are using meta on one side, and we have, and I will not know this study we can confirm. But there is also a second person, which is a Chinese model company, not very known, I believe, now in the open source world, we only gave up a few, but there are 10s of 100%
So we are using meta on one side, and we have, and I will not know this study we can confirm. But there is also a second person, which is a Chinese model company, not very known, I believe, now in the open source world, we only gave up a few, but there are 10s of 100%

S Speaker 240:14is meta. We started off with meta. I mean, Kabir came from meta, right? And it's always easy to convince a US client. You know that it's open source model from a US company versus a Chinese company, but performance is very important. So katira has his own team that that looks at carefully, looks at what is the right model to use a model. I think you know, my understanding is, over the years, I think model, model availability will also increase, performance will increase. We are keeping it fairly flexible that two years from now, if we want to go through a training process on a completely new model, we should be able to do it. Yeah, we are. We are keeping the data set that needs to be, you know, reused. So, so, so we are, we are. We are keeping, keeping those options open, I think so there is a lot of positive tailwind in that sense, also in terms of what's going to be available in the future, in terms of open source models.

S Speaker 141:19Got it and Prakash, is there, say, any internal benchmarks that you guys have run to just say, compare the efficiency or quality of code ABAP code generation for your models versus some of the models out there.

S Speaker 241:37So what is happening, I will tell you, is, instead of actually doing the proactive exercise of benchmarking, before we go to market, you have been forced, in client situations to be compared against, you know, and there is not much, I mean, and profit will do some, open guy will Do some. But it's not, it's not purpose built for that. Yeah, yeah, Turing. I was a Turing, and all these were my clients. I mean, their starting point is, I mean, their objective is not to trade it on ABAP code. I mean, they start point is Python. Let's, let's deploy Python. Army of Python engineers to train so. So in lot of our client situations, we have been compared against legacy ways of code remediation. There are some RPA era tools that are being used robotic process automation tools. So we get compared to that evaluation purpose. And then there will be someone who will also say, hey, I want to compare you against entropic, because I have been using entropic and all of that. So, so we did not create a full benchmark right now, because the reality is, you know, all these tool vendors also, I mean, model vendors also come up with new models every month. How do you keep up with the benchmark? So a lot of it is happening at a client by client evaluation.
So what is happening, I will tell you, is, instead of actually doing the proactive exercise of benchmarking, before we go to market, you have been forced, in client situations to be compared against, you know, and there is not much, I mean, and profit will do some, open guy will Do some.

43:09So fair enough? Yes, totally.
So fair enough? Yes, totally.
So fair enough? Yes, totally.
So fair enough? Yes, totally.
S Speaker 243:13So let me again, I think some of this will be a repetition, yeah. So really, the way we look at it is, there is a team which, which, which is AI first, and they bring the model, and you know, how to fine tune, how to train, how to optimize model performance. And then there is the other team, which is maybe the business process knowledge and ERP knowledge to train the model. So that's, you know, it's a combination of both of this that we have been able to build this demonstrate value. Merck is one of our, you know, early wins. We have a few more that have started now. And you might have seen this case study, but, you know, in case of Merck, for example. And I'll come back to this slide again. But in case of these two slides, but in case of Merck, we are their Gen AI partner for SAP transformation. They are moving from what is called ECC to escort. It's roughly a $400 million program over three years, we went through a very detailed, you know, last six months evaluation process. We are now on boarded as a partner their vendor system. We are working with the SIS of their choice. We are accelerating some parts of the program, by 80% in other cases, we are accelerating by 40, 50% code level acceleration is the fastest. Data harmonization is a very heavy lift. Data harmonization is basically before you move. You know? Why do you want to carry all this data with you, like these systems have been running for 20 years, and people have not taken the effort to do the data cleanup, data validation. There are instances, I believe, 15 terabytes of data on SAP and then, of course, business process conflict. In this case, it's a technical upgrade, so they don't want to change the business processes much right now, right? So again, our deal is a licensed platform, license deal with forward deployed engineers. That's how we are doing it
So let me again, I think some of this will be a repetition, yeah. So really, the way we look at it is, there is a team which, which, which is AI first, and they bring the model, and you know, how to fine tune, how to train, how to optimize model performance. And then there is the other team, which is maybe the business process knowledge and ERP knowledge to train the model. So that's, you know, it's a combination of both of this that we have been able to build this demonstrate value. Merck is one of our, you know, early wins. We have a few more that have started now.

S Speaker 145:36here. And how would this contract look like in terms of revenue? Prakash, you mentioned 400 million is the budget for the overall transformation. What fraction of that would tesera be able to capture?

S Speaker 245:50So we are able to capture so 400 million includes a lot of internal headcount, SAP licenses, change management, the SI spend, the systems integration spend in this is roughly 100 and 50 million, and we are able to accelerate that By on an average across the program, by 40% of

S Speaker 247:13so early days, but we have been able to do enough proof of value before the program starts to give the confidence to the client that we are able to structure these contracts as a as an annual license fee, which the client can renew. It typically starts with one program, but for example, in case of MERV, there are so many other initiatives that are lined up in parallel. So the platform will get used to integrate with the m&a activity. A platform will also be used to run some ongoing operations. See, because while this transformation is happening over three years, Merck is still running their business on the old legacy system, and that old legacy system still needs to be updated and maintained. And you know, so there is an element of ongoing operation, so the platform is used beyond the program, so we are almost always able to demonstrate the ongoing value, agree on an annual license fee, which can be then renewed, and then the forward record engineers are on a time and material

S Speaker 248:32it, got it so, but, but, but your point is correct. We might run into clients who might want a slightly different structure where there is element of outcomes. So some payment upfront, some based on achievement of outcomes. We just have to be prepared to deal with clients who force us to do that, or push us in a corner. I think as the market gets a little more competitive at some point in the future, all those type of, you know, outcome based pricing, I think we have to be ready. We have to be ready with

S Speaker 249:15So, you know, these are typically the use cases and scenarios, accelerated custom code remediation for SAP. This is classic when you're moving from Legacy sap to new SAP, all the custom code, you can't just lift and shift the custom code, because the data models, everything has changed. Business Process will change. So we have to really the tool basically injects all the current custom code in from the legacy environment, and it will map it to, what is it that you can directly take to s4 what needs change and what impact it will have on the business process? So, so it does those analysis. And then, of course, there is human in the loop. We work with the technical teams, and it will also write back. Then it will generate the new code also, right? So it's ingesting, it's analyzing. Then, of course, the technical teams or the business teams get involved, make the decision, and then the AI writes it back.

So number one, number two, number six,
So number one, number two, number six,
So number one, number two, number six,
S Speaker 251:38there are isolated cases where there is a m&a related activity going on. So that happens, but bulk of it is, yeah, transformation. And then, you know, the product cuts across functions. So it is not specific to just manufacturing or finance. It cuts across, you know, all the functional areas. So depending on what the client is using, the client might be using SAP only for manufacturing and finance, or the client might be using it across, you know, HR and supply chain typically, is also used in conjunction with manufacturing, but sometimes they might have best of the supply chain products, yeah. So what else we went through this? I think these are retail. We can skip this. This was cold remediation. These are some demos that you saw. And yeah, I think we think of ourselves as, as a Palantir, for the for the enterprise world.
