============================================================

S Speaker 11:28Yeah, okay. So if you see here, there's four quadrants to this to this p&l. The first one is what we had projected in the past. That's the top that's the sort of the northwest quadrant, top left. Okay. And then in the bottom is what was the actual okay. And so, what's the new management projections, which is what you have here, right? And what is our projections? Understood?
Yeah, okay. So if you see here, there's four quadrants to this to this p&l. The first one is what we had projected in the past. That's the top that's the sort of the northwest quadrant, top left.

S Speaker 12:02that's, that's. I'm okay to add a line. This is revenues. I'm okay to add ARR line because they're different things. And there's a big difference between AR and revenue. So it's okay to have both lines. question is whether you want to have what you should you should be able to answer what's the revenue is sort of hardware plus service plus recurring. Right, we need to we need to we need to make that clear to the team so they understand and the reality is the recurring is a piece but it's you know, this is the hardware is passed through right yeah. And then they set out to some don't remember what the margin is for setup, but there's some decent margin but nothing terribly exciting, right?
that's, that's. I'm okay to add a line. This is revenues. I'm okay to add ARR line because they're different things. And there's a big difference between AR and revenue.

S Speaker 12:51systems integrators to do that. So, okay, so that's the format that might be present. This that one slide, okay. All right. And, you know, if we don't have 100% of it tomorrow, it's okay. We said, Hey, this work in progress, we're working, right? What I'm trying to get to is now we go let's go forward, right. So as I say, you play with Excel, we're gonna be less aggressive, which makes the case for the return in theory less sexy. Right. But, you know, typically we have three cases. For the bearish, the middle point, Mike. Exciting case, right? And we can't we can make the exciting case and hey, why don't you get a better multiple but, you know, the revenues on this, especially if stuff indeed, behave more like what they're projecting, right? Which means you have a very good business, right? Good business. Alright.

S Speaker 14:04right. So you want to talk about how to look at the projections right, how to look at the returns,
right. So you want to talk about how to look at the projections right, how to look at the returns,
right. So you want to talk about how to look at the projections right, how to look at the returns,
right. So you want to talk about how to look at the projections right, how to look at the returns,
S Speaker 24:11right? And, Carlos, before we do that, are the things on the slides up. Slide three to five are those okay? I'm thinking maybe we can move slide four to backup.
right? And, Carlos, before we do that, are the things on the slides up. Slide three to five are those okay? I'm thinking maybe we can move slide four to backup.
right? And, Carlos, before we do that, are the things on the slides up. Slide three to five are those okay? I'm thinking maybe we can move slide four to backup.
right? And, Carlos, before we do that, are the things on the slides up. Slide three to five are those okay? I'm thinking maybe we can move slide four to backup.
S Speaker 14:25And go back to your decision, right? Yeah. So this one is backup right definitely.
And go back to your decision, right? Yeah. So this one is backup right definitely.
And go back to your decision, right? Yeah. So this one is backup right definitely.
And go back to your decision, right? Yeah. So this one is backup right definitely.
S Speaker 14:33This that this one, I will actually try to put it on this format here. Here. I will try to put it like this. Okay. Okay. And we can have after this one, one slide that talks about the improvement in cost, etc. That's all right. But let's you know, to corroborate whatever is here, right? The financing background will be very similar. So, we do the CLA plus a million follow on okay. Because this was the last time Right. Right. So and I would say the company had raised me and which we did not participate. Then they raised the sale in which we participated and we converted or right, and then a new bullet is done. We did 1 million follow on and
This that this one, I will actually try to put it on this format here. Here. I will try to put it like this. Okay. Okay.

S Speaker 15:38say the new round in this case is a series BB Right? Which then we say it's paid to play. It's an internal round. You know, raising ideally searching for which will not close to 12 million new to them
say the new round in this case is a series BB Right? Which then we say it's paid to play. It's an internal round. You know, raising ideally searching for which will not close to 12 million new to them

S Speaker 35:55the company, right? Yeah. And I think what we need to do pre ash we need to
the company, right? Yeah. And I think what we need to do pre ash we need to
the company, right? Yeah. And I think what we need to do pre ash we need to
the company, right? Yeah. And I think what we need to do pre ash we need to
S Speaker 16:04say okay, that's the rest well, what's the burn gonna look like? You should you should get this from and we got to make sure they don't run out of this. 12 million before raising the D. Right? That's right. Yeah. I in my memo I said they're currently burning about one five. So if they burned one five realistically, well would be only two for eight months, which is they have you have to get some point. The revenues from Intuit will come in what those revenues look like. And what the burn drops, the burn. property needs to drop the costs are much, much below 1 million starting. August September. So can you confirm that with the or or in the spreadsheet? Yeah.
say okay, that's the rest well, what's the burn gonna look like? You should you should get this from and we got to make sure they don't run out of this. 12 million before raising the D. Right?

S Speaker 17:06And then on the business performance, we have the number of stores we have sort of the gross margin trajectory we have that they focused on the sort of stadia and these types of stores. Obviously, they have the legacy contracts with the retailers. We have data points so now I should have accuracy and uptime and all those kinds of things. Okay. All right. So let's talk about that. What was your question about us? So

S Speaker 18:18it's a mix of both. What does without getting into too much detail, what does your multiple get to
it's a mix of both. What does without getting into too much detail, what does your multiple get to
it's a mix of both. What does without getting into too much detail, what does your multiple get to
it's a mix of both. What does without getting into too much detail, what does your multiple get to
S Speaker 18:30Yeah, I think that's very rich does because when it's standard cognition last raised second.
Yeah, I think that's very rich does because when it's standard cognition last raised second.
Yeah, I think that's very rich does because when it's standard cognition last raised second.
Yeah, I think that's very rich does because when it's standard cognition last raised second.
S Speaker 38:53Oh, okay. And do we watch the multiple for them? That run Do you know?
Oh, okay. And do we watch the multiple for them? That run Do you know?
Oh, okay. And do we watch the multiple for them? That run Do you know?
Oh, okay. And do we watch the multiple for them? That run Do you know?
S Speaker 29:06is at a billion dollar valuation without 12 million revenue. Okay, and where did you get this? Data from? Facebook? I'm sorry, vegetable.

S Speaker 19:20Rich book. Interesting. I haven't heard we didn't stop standard cognition in the board meeting last week, so I'm surprised if they have to have million then the revenues are a lot bigger than then I

S Speaker 19:38And I'm thinking, you know, we're basically thinking that I fly at this point to sort of the healthiest. Vegas so can you also ask Fabio Hey, John, about the cognition and the sense, but anyway, here's how I'm freaking out at this. We're gonna have a business that, you know, we're basically projecting to nearly double every year. That's high growth, right and investors will want to pay a higher multiple for high growth. We also I have a business that has a reasonable component of hardware, I receive a component of service and only a portion of it which is returned, right? Yeah. So we can think of this as a business because it's not right.
And I'm thinking, you know, we're basically thinking that I fly at this point to sort of the healthiest.

S Speaker 110:38I'm almost like, to be honest, I think almost like even
I'm almost like, to be honest, I think almost like even
I'm almost like, to be honest, I think almost like even
I'm almost like, to be honest, I think almost like even
S Speaker 110:52But, you know, but then we'd have these other ones that are, yeah, I would probably be more comfortable with the 8x or 9x or whatever. Anyway, we let's start with that and see what what we get right. Okay. Now, we have our projections and
But, you know, but then we'd have these other ones that are, yeah, I would probably be more comfortable with the 8x or 9x or whatever. Anyway, we let's start with that and see what what we get right. Okay. Now, we have our projections and
But, you know, but then we'd have these other ones that are, yeah, I would probably be more comfortable with the 8x or 9x or whatever. Anyway, we let's start with that and see what what we get right. Okay. Now, we have our projections and
But, you know, but then we'd have these other ones that are, yeah, I would probably be more comfortable with the 8x or 9x or whatever. Anyway, we let's start with that and see what what we get right. Okay. Now, we have our projections and
S Speaker 111:17you know, I again, think they will raise after the round year, next year, which we haven't thought talked about what it is, but let's assume it's a let's assume sort of it's $40 million seed round next year. Right and then maybe we don't need to model beyond that. Okay, so $40 million year round.
you know, I again, think they will raise after the round year, next year, which we haven't thought talked about what it is, but let's assume it's a let's assume sort of it's $40 million seed round next year. Right and then maybe we don't need to model beyond that. Okay, so $40 million year round.

S Speaker 111:51would be what do we own 2% 3.2% 2.83%.
S Speaker 112:10one to 2 million, right. Yeah. And then we can say okay, we get, you know, you would need to project out to 2728 and maybe, you know, what's the exit and 28 or something like that?
one to 2 million, right. Yeah. And then we can say okay, we get, you know, you would need to project out to 2728 and maybe, you know, what's the exit and 28 or something like that?
one to 2 million, right. Yeah. And then we can say okay, we get, you know, you would need to project out to 2728 and maybe, you know, what's the exit and 28 or something like that?
one to 2 million, right. Yeah. And then we can say okay, we get, you know, you would need to project out to 2728 and maybe, you know, what's the exit and 28 or something like that?
S Speaker 312:30Right. 2028 is like, three years four. years from now. Right? I don't think I think 26
Right. 2028 is like, three years four. years from now. Right? I don't think I think 26
Right. 2028 is like, three years four. years from now. Right? I don't think I think 26
Right. 2028 is like, three years four. years from now. Right? I don't think I think 26
S Speaker 112:39is pretty mature. The exit is either 27 or 28. Right? So let's get what those numbers look like. And then I mean, the way you think about this is, again, we will have invested 1 million, sorry,
is pretty mature. The exit is either 27 or 28. Right? So let's get what those numbers look like. And then I mean, the way you think about this is, again, we will have invested 1 million, sorry,
is pretty mature. The exit is either 27 or 28. Right? So let's get what those numbers look like. And then I mean, the way you think about this is, again, we will have invested 1 million, sorry,
is pretty mature. The exit is either 27 or 28. Right? So let's get what those numbers look like. And then I mean, the way you think about this is, again, we will have invested 1 million, sorry,
S Speaker 312:59by the way, in general, you think we should do pro rata
by the way, in general, you think we should do pro rata
by the way, in general, you think we should do pro rata
by the way, in general, you think we should do pro rata
S Speaker 113:05based on what you've seen so far, or or a little bit above or above
based on what you've seen so far, or or a little bit above or above
based on what you've seen so far, or or a little bit above or above
based on what you've seen so far, or or a little bit above or above
S Speaker 213:11a little bit of a pro rata might make sense, Carlos, but I am not too aggressive. I wouldn't go to something like a 1.5. Maybe up to one would be my suggestion.
a little bit of a pro rata might make sense, Carlos, but I am not too aggressive. I wouldn't go to something like a 1.5. Maybe up to one would be my suggestion.
a little bit of a pro rata might make sense, Carlos, but I am not too aggressive. I wouldn't go to something like a 1.5. Maybe up to one would be my suggestion.
a little bit of a pro rata might make sense, Carlos, but I am not too aggressive. I wouldn't go to something like a 1.5. Maybe up to one would be my suggestion.
S Speaker 113:221 million, right. Yeah. That's what my mind is. I would maybe do one so we did four. Then one we will do one now. And then let's assume that businesses, whatever we did another one, so that's a total of seven. Right? So we'll have seven to eight. And it's hard but
1 million, right. Yeah. That's what my mind is. I would maybe do one so we did four. Then one we will do one now. And then let's assume that businesses, whatever we did another one, so that's a total of seven. Right? So we'll have seven to eight. And it's hard but
1 million, right. Yeah. That's what my mind is. I would maybe do one so we did four. Then one we will do one now. And then let's assume that businesses, whatever we did another one, so that's a total of seven. Right? So we'll have seven to eight. And it's hard but

S Speaker 113:54So 27 You have what was the revenue?
S Speaker 213:58Grayson once again, I was projecting it. Myself.
14:07So 52 We probably our number will probably be more like
So 52 We probably our number will probably be more like
So 52 We probably our number will probably be more like
So 52 We probably our number will probably be more like
S Speaker 114:143540 I'm guessing. Yeah. Right. Yeah. So and

this easy right let's say it's, that's a it's whatever. 75 Okay, then. That's 750.
this easy right let's say it's, that's a it's whatever. 75 Okay, then. That's 750.
this easy right let's say it's, that's a it's whatever. 75 Okay, then. That's 750.
S Speaker 116:402.5% of 750 75. That was 10% 75 by four. That's twice close to 20.
2.5% of 750 75. That was 10% 75 by four. That's twice close to 20.
2.5% of 750 75. That was 10% 75 by four. That's twice close to 20.

S Speaker 217:10You can imagine God have you been traveling? But yeah, one question here Carlos. The queue CV investment thing. Is this the entire investment till date or is it just for this round?
You can imagine God have you been traveling? But yeah, one question here Carlos. The queue CV investment thing. Is this the entire investment till date or is it just for this round?
You can imagine God have you been traveling? But yeah, one question here Carlos. The queue CV investment thing. Is this the entire investment till date or is it just for this round?
You can imagine God have you been traveling? But yeah, one question here Carlos. The queue CV investment thing. Is this the entire investment till date or is it just for this round?
S Speaker 117:26So that's the entire the follow on is this round. Okay.
So that's the entire the follow on is this round. Okay.
So that's the entire the follow on is this round. Okay.
So that's the entire the follow on is this round. Okay.
S Speaker 317:34Right. Yeah. So So I, the challenge is again, we're going to have one more round right? Yes.
Right. Yeah. So So I, the challenge is again, we're going to have one more round right? Yes.
Right. Yeah. So So I, the challenge is again, we're going to have one more round right? Yes.
Right. Yeah. So So I, the challenge is again, we're going to have one more round right? Yes.
S Speaker 117:43should you should ask Ling Ling and bright, how best to model this. If we're gonna have it, we definitely gonna have another round. Right. Yeah. And I would make things simple. I would basically say, you know, we'll we'll have that run and let's again, I'm picking a number we never talked about it right. But let's say we raise 40 and the dilution is is what 20%. So 40 divided by point two, so that's times five. It's a 400 million valuation is what that round would be. I don't think that next round will be at 400. This is at 100. Let's say the next one. The business does super well, whatever. It's let's say it's 203 and two, and 240 post. I think that's sort of feels better to me and then the exit you know, let's say again,
should you should ask Ling Ling and bright, how best to model this. If we're gonna have it, we definitely gonna have another round. Right. Yeah. And I would make things simple.

18:53it's in the I'm doing 70 What's what's not said? What's the recurring in 26 that you had
it's in the I'm doing 70 What's what's not said? What's the recurring in 26 that you had
it's in the I'm doing 70 What's what's not said? What's the recurring in 26 that you had
it's in the I'm doing 70 What's what's not said? What's the recurring in 26 that you had
19:09a good year in 2652 now it will get discounted after whatever we have discussed. But yes,
a good year in 2652 now it will get discounted after whatever we have discussed. But yes,
a good year in 2652 now it will get discounted after whatever we have discussed. But yes,
a good year in 2652 now it will get discounted after whatever we have discussed. But yes,
S Speaker 119:21yeah. 52 now and then I grow at 30 That's that's us. 50. So that's 67 study. That's another another 18 shows that 85 Right? Yeah. Call it 80 And cut it by, you know, 30% so that we're going to be close to defecting. 60 at accent with a 10x Multiple. That's that's a $600 million business. That's sort of looking backwards. Right if your projected going forward. Exit. So that's another 8800 So if if the next round is at 240 and this thing eventually sells for 100. There's plenty of headroom between today and the exit event the next round that we're thinking at 250 ish, right yeah, to the next one is still at 3x return right. So to me whenever you have a follow on you should have hopefully, you know 3x Return possibility which we actually think it's visible. Right, right. And if we exit again at 750 we owned close to 3%. That will be $22 million, exit and we will have had suddenly the men so it's a 3x sort of thing.
yeah. 52 now and then I grow at 30 That's that's us. 50. So that's 67 study. That's another another 18 shows that 85 Right? Yeah.

S Speaker 122:22Right. I think that all Yeah, I we have effectively two rounds. So I don't know how to use that model.
Right. I think that all Yeah, I we have effectively two rounds. So I don't know how to use that model.
Right. I think that all Yeah, I we have effectively two rounds. So I don't know how to use that model.
Right. I think that all Yeah, I we have effectively two rounds. So I don't know how to use that model.
S Speaker 222:32It sounds good. Yeah. Got it. So for tomorrow, Carlos. I'll try to make some numbers on the return analysis because I don't think I'll be able to have that conversation with link up right before that. But other than that, I think I'm good. I do understand everything. I need to do.
It sounds good. Yeah. Got it. So for tomorrow, Carlos. I'll try to make some numbers on the return analysis because I don't think I'll be able to have that conversation with link up right before that. But other than that, I think I'm good. I do understand everything. I need to do.

S Speaker 122:48Yeah, but let's let's let's, I think we have too much info. We can't show all of this. We can put in the backup. Yeah, let's try to use that format. And then we say look, guys, this is what we're still we're still trying to refine this directionally right now we feel good about doing definitely pro rata we fact we think we should do closer to a million now increase our ownership a little right. We think there will be another X not around next year with Sony 4200. I think that's reasonable. At which point we decide how much to invest. But it feels like the business's sort of now seems to be at a point where it could hit the inflection point. Right. Okay. So we do that. Financing is very similar, just update the business. Projection is you know, number of stores improvement in efficiency. I think you have the chart with that that right that's decreasing, etc. All of those things, if you send me a well, I don't know if we'll have time. But if you send me a draft sometime between now and tomorrow, some maybe a 30 Am or so then I can take a look and maybe make a few couple of edits here and there. On the text. I'll do. Okay. Sounds good,
Yeah, but let's let's let's, I think we have too much info. We can't show all of this. We can put in the backup. Yeah, let's try to use that format.
