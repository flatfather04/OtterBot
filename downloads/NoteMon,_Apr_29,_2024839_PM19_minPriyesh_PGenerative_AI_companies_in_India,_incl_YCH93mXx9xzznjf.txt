S Speaker 10:58that sounds very interesting. You say like, how how, what sort of generative AI companies are you seeing in India? Are they mostly consumer focused? Or are they on enterprise focus? Do you see there is like a big market for enterprise clients in India?
that sounds very interesting. You say like, how how, what sort of generative AI companies are you seeing in India? Are they mostly consumer focused? Or are they on enterprise focus? Do you see there is like a big market for enterprise clients in India?

S Speaker 21:16Yeah, so you're using all kinds of companies. I just make my mark, right. You are to basically I'm tracking some like, you know, 8090 companies right now and you will see all flavors. So let you know at the application layer we are seeing a lot of ways to just take on some like you know generator, tools, content creation tools, kind of companies right. So that we can layer on consumer side and then on our enterprise end we are able to see everything. People are looking to like a million copilot for certain verticals. People looking to automate sales for those people looking to automate customer successful close, develop like innovative like new software tools for industries like Pharma. So we are going to see more those kind of things on the enterprise application side then on the middleware side, we are seeing LLM ops medical records escape I think LLM security LLM evals motivation so it was kind of middleware. On the entrance I would say there's less activity because negativity there are like I don't know where we are invested in and then let you know we own models below models. On the deployment side. We are seeing companies play there are a handful, but we don't but they are lagging way behind together any skill that you get all the large guys in the US Yeah. This is the probably the lay of the land in India. And so your second question, I think I just start I

S Speaker 12:56don't even remember what he said. But yeah, ha Do you Do you see a willingness to pay from on enterprise clients who are native to India?

S Speaker 13:39Fair enough. Yeah, that makes sense. So real personally, are you looking at more seed stage, later series A or later?
Fair enough. Yeah, that makes sense. So real personally, are you looking at more seed stage, later series A or later?
Fair enough. Yeah, that makes sense. So real personally, are you looking at more seed stage, later series A or later?

S Speaker 23:49Even though my sweet spot is the idea of 5 million tracks, two and 1 million tracks? So five year crops into records Lilia, both of those highlight basically layers and diabet of things. And then a five and 10 be hard limit mania. It's a very company and very early we can do over here as well. Let's say they're sitting around the family and obligated to put up with a house and that takes a lot of company was making 40 million we are also happy to be here as a product developer now I think we are very considered to be currently investing. Early Stage vehicle is 800 million. So I think that is ready to sign our checks company and then we have a 1.2 billion rows fine so that can come in at later stage but

S Speaker 14:34that's pretty interesting, bro like that's a lot of dry powder. I am sure like you that makes so much more sense now that you're tracking 90 company that was like hearty coffee but our market map but that makes so many so much more sense now. For Qualcomm I think we are mostly as we thought would be about the same size of China. But a lot of times we would also lose very late stage deals, especially in this infrastructure traditional foundational model of generative AI, we have investments in anthropic weights and biases and a few other ml ops layer so once up may it's usually later stage and the way we are seeing early stages mostly there's there's like like you know, a node of noise a lot of risks to bet and the come and the team is more flexible to sort of wait it out. They do not mind a higher valuation because a lot of it is also strategic focus for Qualcomm. So that goes back that I think I do see that I do come across a lot of early stage Gen AI companies, which do have a dog in India. So every time I come across something like that, I'll send that across to you. Feel free to like if it aligns, I'd be happy to make that connection. Right now evaluating one ad tech company in generative AI Indian founders. Their first app is in India. But they plan to expand like post that just it's sort of an MVP but they plan to do a lot of us in Europe post that to agar agar it's it seems good we are leaning to invest if it if there's more space. It's called Sick IQ.

S Speaker 26:16See, like you're gonna cost this one because
S Speaker 16:20the founders are based in us right now. But Anca first is in UPSC space. So
the founders are based in us right now. But Anca first is in UPSC space. So
the founders are based in us right now. But Anca first is in UPSC space. So
the founders are based in us right now. But Anca first is in UPSC space. So
S Speaker 26:27is this called par.ai? Yes, yes. Yeah. Yeah, I think we have I guess. I wasn't the one who met this company, but I checked my colleagues like where we ended up, but I think this was an interesting one that like, you know, we kind of were tracking so say like you I didn't know that like we have a company that's
is this called par.ai? Yes, yes. Yeah. Yeah, I think we have I guess. I wasn't the one who met this company, but I checked my colleagues like where we ended up, but I think this was an interesting one that like, you know, we kind of were tracking so say like you I didn't know that like we have a company that's

6:52pretty unique domain name per Hi Otalia. In case you,
pretty unique domain name per Hi Otalia. In case you,
pretty unique domain name per Hi Otalia. In case you,
pretty unique domain name per Hi Otalia. In case you,
S Speaker 26:59this will be someone playing difficulty sharing what we're looking at. And I'm sure like you know, on the other hand, we have certain companies I felt like you know, required some wastage so I can give you like, you know, couple of adapter like servers one which is like a noose around from Moore's law, but I'm sure like, you know, all financial models go with they will need like the other company we will use a bigger voice to worse model is called Chi EI. They are currently the same 30 million round to launch their first model, but in that has a diverse portfolio, which might be relevant for you. And then there are a few early ones who are not making anything immediately, but can raise that down the line there is this company continuous AI, which is building agents, agents, basically like your best friend or foe, or even people that use the website. Still early, but I think like you know, these kinds of companies that you will be basically next to 12 months or 18 months when they would let you know HSPs VOCs. So I'm happy to like a challenge that you absolutely in the ecosystem as well because I'm sure like, you know, companies are like raising money because it's a company every business.

S Speaker 110:13totally broke totally. There's a relationship of what's the long term plan like do you you mentioned you want to stay in venture which makes a lot of sense that is where I am, but eventually probably 510 years down the line. Do you have an exit? Do you are you thinking about an exit?
totally broke totally. There's a relationship of what's the long term plan like do you you mentioned you want to stay in venture which makes a lot of sense that is where I am, but eventually probably 510 years down the line. Do you have an exit? Do you are you thinking about an exit?
totally broke totally. There's a relationship of what's the long term plan like do you you mentioned you want to stay in venture which makes a lot of sense that is where I am, but eventually probably 510 years down the line. Do you have an exit? Do you are you thinking about an exit?

S Speaker 210:30Yeah, I don't know yet. But so basically, the thing I'm looking for in this role is to be myself, be there okay. I can be a good investor. Yeah. So, you know, it's for us already for that maybe like a couple of years or three years. I will get some sense of our my other investor and then if I let you go, geez, who hear that okay, I'm a good investor. Then spend like you know, I will be a bit more of like a monitor do what when I can practice my thing. So like you know, and I keep talking about Sonic my own thing. Like, my own investment firm. I keep like you're thinking about doing this thing, globally, which I think should also happen as a part of me to be in because they're not similar anymore. To you so and so I think going back to building is something that you have which has not crossed my mind. So I do come across like you know, some interesting ideas. I do know some interesting ideas, but you even know Interscope barriers because they are like no I really thought building but but I think I will enjoy is like you know, sort of this matches to do when you are trying to kind of like also sort of like you're investing in them and you have like a board of like civilian companies. Those still building my knowledge because you will also have to resort or trade either as an investor. So just how I'm thinking about it, but I think first, like close to milestone would be to like just, yeah,
Yeah, I don't know yet. But so basically, the thing I'm looking for in this role is to be myself, be there okay. I can be a good investor. Yeah. So, you know, it's for us already for that maybe like a couple of years or three years.

S Speaker 112:07investor rule. I cannot tell you how much I relate to everything you said. I am thinking of starting my venture fund down the line. So trying to see if I can make some of those LP relationships now. College was a great place to sort of meet those high net worth individuals, a lot of those board advisors to forge a connection has been a but yes, I agree. It will be some time before I'm able to do that. I don't know maybe I'm being a little bit more aggressive. I'm putting a three year five year timeline to it and which might be over ambitious, but I'll probably realize that down the line when I'm actually in the trade more deeply. At the same time when Loga when I was at Menlo I was also sort of interfacing with their Menlo labs the venture studio model that they have. Very interesting. I love the framework they have created I love how they think about things validate that they've put a fucking machine on top of it and churning ideas back and back again, which is a pretty pretty amazing model I feel could be very well replicated in India. Boards are the opportunities. But yeah,
