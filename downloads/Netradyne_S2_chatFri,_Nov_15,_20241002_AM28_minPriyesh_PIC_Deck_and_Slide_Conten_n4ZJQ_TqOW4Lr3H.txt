S Speaker 10:00Where it's more kind of the stuff that was in the company's main slide, right? It's, yeah, it's, you know, venturedine and then all the others, Samsung or emotive geotech, you know, we can flush it out with a couple of more logos if we want, but it could be fairly basic. I think that's the only one that's really missing from the IC deck. Everything else is kind of like, you know, it's the summary slide, the product slide, the cap table management team, right? And then the financial competitive slide, super easy

S Speaker 20:37I can put. I edited one slide too, or the one question, but I did it in the other deck, on the customer acquisition cost. I added that slide into the v2 on the stage one, for the questions, but and for the IC deck, I can start the skeleton. I put it in our chat and like, and I can start on the execute executive summary. And, you know, like the intro slide, kind of like to give the segue into the executive summary, and then, you know, like you said, like the product slide, the strategic fit slide, you know, and then, and obviously the management slide, and kind of, like the investment thesis. So I can, I can solve it skeleton and, like, fill in, fill the content. And then we can modify, yeah, I'm

S Speaker 11:20not sure how much we're going to add on the strategic fit slide. I'm not sure we need an entire slide on it, or if it's just executive summary and because it's already there, right? Yeah, it's kind of already there. Everyone already knows it. Yeah, that makes sense. If Quinn or Carlos want a separate slide, I think that's fine as well. But this isn't a type two deal. This is a type one deal, right? So it's not like it needs a ton of weight on it. I think the strategic fit is fairly clear we can, you know, and I don't know if Quinn wants to add, you know, product details. I haven't reached out to the BU yet, tax, I actually don't even know what the exact skew is, which might be something good to have,

S Speaker 21:59like an 800 or whatever, like, you know, skewer. I think that is an expect. It's
like an 800 or whatever, like, you know, skewer. I think that is an expect. It's
like an 800 or whatever, like, you know, skewer. I think that is an expect. It's
like an 800 or whatever, like, you know, skewer. I think that is an expect. It's
2:03an expensive skew, for sure,
an expensive skew, for sure,
an expensive skew, for sure,
an expensive skew, for sure,
S Speaker 22:07when I, when I was talking to my thinking, at least they were looking at it, because they need, like, a certain AI, you know, some certain number of tops for like, their their capabilities. Yeah, right. Yeah, yeah. Go ahead. So do you want to take a look at the do you want to take a look at that slide for, like, the CIC two? Like, really quick, if that's kind of like what you envisioned on the for answering that question for Tushar,
when I, when I was talking to my thinking, at least they were looking at it, because they need, like, a certain AI, you know, some certain number of tops for like, their their capabilities. Yeah, right. Yeah, yeah. Go ahead. So do you want to take a look at the do you want to take a look at that slide for, like, the CIC two?

Like, really quick, if that's kind of like what you envisioned on the for answering that question for Tushar,
S Speaker 12:39sorry, which one is this is for the stage two, yes, yeah. Do you have the do you want to put it up real quick, and we'll take a look at it quick.
sorry, which one is this is for the stage two, yes, yeah. Do you have the do you want to put it up real quick, and we'll take a look at it quick.
sorry, which one is this is for the stage two, yes, yeah. Do you have the do you want to put it up real quick, and we'll take a look at it quick.
sorry, which one is this is for the stage two, yes, yeah. Do you have the do you want to put it up real quick, and we'll take a look at it quick.
S Speaker 22:57So what I was thinking, Yeah, so what I was thinking is, you know, to regards to two questions, kind of like, basically viewed his concern has to be like, some, some, some formatting stuff still happening. But there's basically two pieces that I think are very sure very well, like, how we think about marketing, kind of impact it has one of them is obviously like, show how, how to see it, how the cat differentiates within these segments. So the camis shows you, like, yes.
So what I was thinking, Yeah, so what I was thinking is, you know, to regards to two questions, kind of like, basically viewed his concern has to be like, some, some, some formatting stuff still happening.

3:28Are you sharing slides right now?

3:30Yes, oh, it doesn't show. Let me do
Yes, oh, it doesn't show. Let me do

3:34one more time. Sorry, I

one more time. Sorry, I
one more time. Sorry, I
S Speaker 23:36didn't work. Okay. Now it should work. There we go. Okay, so it's very simple. There's like, I mean, we can pull up different metrics, but just wanted to hear your feedback. It's kind of like, that's kind of like, what your vision? So basically, it's two sections. It's like, one of them is kind of show, okay, how does the CAC differentiate within each of the segments, which kind of like, is, naturally, we would assume the mid market is very high. It shows like where the enterprise is, the resale is, and where the international segment is in terms of average, like CAC per year. But it also shows like respect the whole for the whole non Amazon. Basically the average, I may call it average, is essentially showing that that given, given the low contribution of of of the mid market and the offset by resale India, because of the extreme low, low, low CAC that the average CAC for, you know, each of those years is actually below The Enterprise CAC for for netradynec numbers.
didn't work. Okay. Now it should work. There we go. Okay, so it's very simple. There's like, I mean, we can pull up different metrics, but just wanted to hear your feedback.

S Speaker 24:41Yes, I looked at it from an annual perspective, and essentially just calculated each candidate. They didn't include the resale. So I included resale. Otherwise,
Yes, I looked at it from an annual perspective, and essentially just calculated each candidate. They didn't include the resale. So I included resale. Otherwise,
Yes, I looked at it from an annual perspective, and essentially just calculated each candidate. They didn't include the resale. So I included resale. Otherwise,
Yes, I looked at it from an annual perspective, and essentially just calculated each candidate. They didn't include the resale. So I included resale. Otherwise,
S Speaker 14:53I was wondering, if I'm not mistaken, I think the numbers look way off, right? They should be on a per unit basis. So if it's not, it's not Summing up, right? The cash can't be $10,000 it's $1,000 Oh, this is, yes,
I was wondering, if I'm not mistaken, I think the numbers look way off, right? They should be on a per unit basis. So if it's not, it's not Summing up, right? The cash can't be $10,000 it's $1,000 Oh, this is, yes,
I was wondering, if I'm not mistaken, I think the numbers look way off, right? They should be on a per unit basis. So if it's not, it's not Summing up, right? The cash can't be $10,000 it's $1,000 Oh, this is, yes,

S Speaker 25:13yeah. This is not looking at unit this. I can do it per unit, by the way. This is looking at it from, from, from a total to like, show, like, the offset of it. But I can do it per unit, because, obviously,
yeah. This is not looking at unit this. I can do it per unit, by the way. This is looking at it from, from, from a total to like, show, like, the offset of it. But I can do it per unit, because, obviously,
yeah. This is not looking at unit this. I can do it per unit, by the way. This is looking at it from, from, from a total to like, show, like, the offset of it. But I can do it per unit, because, obviously,
yeah. This is not looking at unit this. I can do it per unit, by the way. This is looking at it from, from, from a total to like, show, like, the offset of it. But I can do it per unit, because, obviously,
S Speaker 15:23I think it's by unit, because that's the big difference when you're kind of thinking between enterprise and mid market, right? The difference is your, you put a little bit of effort into getting an enterprise customer, you get 50,000 units, right? Your CAC, your LTV to CAC, is low, right? And we can show it by LTV to CAC as well, and pure CAC, but the cost of acquisition for mid market customers is generally higher, right? It's like $1,000 versus, if you looked at enterprise, it's like $300 right?
I think it's by unit, because that's the big difference when you're kind of thinking between enterprise and mid market, right? The difference is your, you put a little bit of effort into getting an enterprise customer, you get 50,000 units, right? Your CAC, your LTV to CAC, is low, right?

It's like $1,000 versus, if you looked at enterprise, it's like $300 right?
6:00Yeah, yeah, it's exactly like one and a half 1000, almost, I
Yeah, yeah, it's exactly like one and a half 1000, almost, I
Yeah, yeah, it's exactly like one and a half 1000, almost, I
Yeah, yeah, it's exactly like one and a half 1000, almost, I
S Speaker 16:03think so the only we can't show it this way, because people know the numbers on a per unit basis, right? Like we make, you know, $40 a month per per device, right? That's you get the $300 for the device, and then $40 a month as your subscription. You want to look at it on your Okay, right? First is your revenue, not total. Total is based on growth, right? So
think so the only we can't show it this way, because people know the numbers on a per unit basis, right? Like we make, you know, $40 a month per per device, right? That's you get the $300 for the device, and then $40 a month as your subscription. You want to look at it on your Okay, right? First is your revenue, not total. Total is based on growth, right? So

That's you get the $300 for the device, and then $40 a month as your subscription. You want to look at it on your Okay, right? First is your revenue, not total. Total is based on growth, right? So

That's you get the $300 for the device, and then $40 a month as your subscription. You want to look at it on your Okay, right? First is your revenue, not total. Total is based on growth, right? So
S Speaker 26:31that's what I was thinking first, because I thought I can show obviously, I can. I can change that per unit. Because the thought process here was that if we show it based on, because this is based on, well, I have to like that, tie it back to our growth. If you do it, tie it back to our growth assumptions essentially, then it kind of like shows how, like, in total the cost, because we're not showing mid market growing as much as like, maybe, like somebody thinks, because when you see here on the contribution in credit, or contribution by segment, the mid market really only contributes roughly, like, you know, like 10, 11% to, like, the total incremental AR. That's
that's what I was thinking first, because I thought I can show obviously, I can. I can change that per unit. Because the thought process here was that if we show it based on, because this is based on, well, I have to like that, tie it back to our growth. If you do it, tie it back to our growth assumptions essentially, then it kind of like shows how, like, in total the cost, because we're not showing mid market growing as much as like, maybe, like somebody thinks, because when you see here on the contribution in credit, or contribution by segment, the mid market really only contributes roughly, like, you know, like 10, 11% to, like, the total incremental AR. That's
that's what I was thinking first, because I thought I can show obviously, I can. I can change that per unit. Because the thought process here was that if we show it based on, because this is based on, well, I have to like that, tie it back to our growth. If you do it, tie it back to our growth assumptions essentially, then it kind of like shows how, like, in total the cost, because we're not showing mid market growing as much as like, maybe, like somebody thinks, because when you see here on the contribution in credit, or contribution by segment, the mid market really only contributes roughly, like, you know, like 10, 11% to, like, the total incremental AR. That's
that's what I was thinking first, because I thought I can show obviously, I can. I can change that per unit. Because the thought process here was that if we show it based on, because this is based on, well, I have to like that, tie it back to our growth. If you do it, tie it back to our growth assumptions essentially, then it kind of like shows how, like, in total the cost, because we're not showing mid market growing as much as like, maybe, like somebody thinks, because when you see here on the contribution in credit, or contribution by segment, the mid market really only contributes roughly, like, you know, like 10, 11% to, like, the total incremental AR. That's
S Speaker 17:10the right way. The bottom one is, is correct? That's a good way to show it to basically say, hey, at the end of the day, look, we're a big blue company, right? It's all that's where our ARR comes from. That's the segment we really need to believe in. Mid market. We need to stay competitive in that area, but like, it's no no one's planned that we're gonna own and dominate that market, right? I'd say there's way more competitive, there's better other players, Legacy players. There's another slide I'll add to kind of show the change in mix on that as well, which is basically for video, right? The penetration of the video market today is very low. And then if, if you look at connected vehicle, it's already a it's a mature market, right? It's like 80% penetrated. So we're fighting for that top 20% when you're kind of going up to full connected so that's why you know that side is going to be smaller, that's going to be on the connected vehicle, not the video solution side, but the same time mid market is right is going to be that that potentially more value oriented customer, the guy's looking for the all in one solution and things like that, we need to own and like we need to keep growing in enterprise. But enterprise has a lot more Greenfield opportunity, and that's where, that's why, you know, we'll think we're doing well in enterprise today. We need to keep doing well in enterprise because as far as ARR contribution over the next five years, that's where we're going to grow enterprise value, right? We're our enterprise value grows with the video market. We need to have competitive solutions for other parts of the market, not to let the some stars of the world only push up toward us, but the like, as you're relating to tech, basically, we're saying yes, for us to compete in that world, it's going to cost us more to compete in that world, right? So to compete in mid market, it's going to be more expensive on a per unit basis for us too, and when our assumptions justify that right, it's not like we're saying, you know, it's the same, yeah, let me know if that methodology doesn't make sense to either of you, because, you know, this is a right. Obviously, don't want to get
the right way. The bottom one is, is correct? That's a good way to show it to basically say, hey, at the end of the day, look, we're a big blue company, right? It's all that's where our ARR comes from. That's the segment we really need to believe in. Mid market. We need to stay competitive in that area, but like, it's no no one's planned that we're gonna own and dominate that market, right?

We need to have competitive solutions for other parts of the market, not to let the some stars of the world only push up toward us, but the like, as you're relating to tech, basically, we're saying yes, for us to compete in that world, it's going to cost us more to compete in that world, right? So to compete in mid market, it's going to be more expensive on a per unit basis for us too, and when our assumptions justify that right, it's not like we're saying, you know, it's the same, yeah, let me know if that methodology doesn't make sense to either of you, because, you know, this is a right. Obviously, don't want to get
the right way. The bottom one is, is correct? That's a good way to show it to basically say, hey, at the end of the day, look, we're a big blue company, right? It's all that's where our ARR comes from. That's the segment we really need to believe in. Mid market. We need to stay competitive in that area, but like, it's no no one's planned that we're gonna own and dominate that market, right? I'd say there's way more competitive, there's better other players, Legacy players. There's another slide I'll add to kind of show the change in mix on that as well, which is basically for video, right? The penetration of the video market today is very low. And then if, if you look at connected vehicle, it's already a it's a mature market, right? It's like 80% penetrated. So we're fighting for that top 20% when you're kind of going up to full connected so that's why you know that side is going to be smaller, that's going to be on the connected vehicle, not the video solution side, but the same time mid market is right is going to be that that potentially more value oriented customer, the guy's looking for the all in one solution and things like that, we need to own and like we need to keep growing in enterprise. But enterprise has a lot more Greenfield opportunity, and that's where, that's why, you know, we'll think we're doing well in enterprise today. We need to keep doing well in enterprise because as far as ARR contribution over the next five years, that's where we're going to grow enterprise value, right?

Obviously, don't want to get
S Speaker 29:41called out. No, that makes sense. It makes that makes sense. So other than that, I don't think there's, I mean, we can, we can slice some of the data into like, we can show some some different views on other metrics too, but, but at the end of the day, I think they all tell the same story. So I don't know if you have, like, another view in mind, like another metric in mind that you want to show in regards to CAC, but, but I think, like, if we, if I change that to, like you said to per units. And I, you know, for once, I put some bullet points in
called out. No, that makes sense. It makes that makes sense. So other than that, I don't think there's, I mean, we can, we can slice some of the data into like, we can show some some different views on other metrics too, but, but at the end of the day, I think they all tell the same story.

And I, you know, for once, I put some bullet points in
S Speaker 110:09there, basically, right? You have Enterprise today at like, $250 CAC, right, yeah. We're saying by 2028 the CAC is going to be $450 right at the end? Yes. So, you know, even in our best market, you know, we are expecting acquisition costs right to get more competitive, we're gonna have to work harder to get more customers. Yeah, exactly, yeah. The same kind of in mid market, mid market where, like, at 1000 today, and, you know, it's 1300 or whatever kind of in at the end of 28 right? So, like, we're not expecting, you know, our acquisition costs to really improve much in mid market. It's going to continue to be hard, right? And that's kind of a story. So we're not basically saying we're owning the enterprise market, you know, because we're, you know, you know, we have these unrealistic assumptions that this doesn't get more competitive, it does get more competitive, but we'll continue to, you know, we can continue to grow even in that kind of scenario where cost of acquisition essentially doubles over the next, you know, four years for for even at the bread,
there, basically, right? You have Enterprise today at like, $250 CAC, right, yeah. We're saying by 2028 the CAC is going to be $450 right at the end? Yes. So, you know, even in our best market, you know, we are expecting acquisition costs right to get more competitive, we're gonna have to work harder to get more customers. Yeah, exactly, yeah.

S Speaker 211:24yeah, yeah. So basically shows that that we are, the numbers that we have shown in Financials already assume, like, like, like, a substantial growth in customer acquisition costs. You're not, like, just ignoring that fact, right?
yeah, yeah. So basically shows that that we are, the numbers that we have shown in Financials already assume, like, like, like, a substantial growth in customer acquisition costs. You're not, like, just ignoring that fact, right?
yeah, yeah. So basically shows that that we are, the numbers that we have shown in Financials already assume, like, like, like, a substantial growth in customer acquisition costs. You're not, like, just ignoring that fact, right?
yeah, yeah. So basically shows that that we are, the numbers that we have shown in Financials already assume, like, like, like, a substantial growth in customer acquisition costs. You're not, like, just ignoring that fact, right?
11:39That's kind of exactly where we are
That's kind of exactly where we are
That's kind of exactly where we are
That's kind of exactly where we are
S Speaker 211:41today. And given, given that the mid market is very just, it's a small portion of of the overall, like, you know, revenue and increment AR that we have real material forecasting, it has, like, a very, very minimal impact on the on the average customer acquisition costs, right? That's kind of the takeaway. So, like, we're not, we're not under, under counting or like under we are not under evaluating, like the customer should just talk also, I think, I think that's kind of like the takeaway, right? So for char, right?
today. And given, given that the mid market is very just, it's a small portion of of the overall, like, you know, revenue and increment AR that we have real material forecasting, it has, like, a very, very minimal impact on the on the average customer acquisition costs, right?

So for char, right?
S Speaker 112:1724 right. So we'll do each like, December 24 december 25 this way we have our baseline as well. Not that we're only starting with the end of 25
24 right. So we'll do each like, December 24 december 25 this way we have our baseline as well. Not that we're only starting with the end of 25
24 right. So we'll do each like, December 24 december 25 this way we have our baseline as well. Not that we're only starting with the end of 25
24 right. So we'll do each like, December 24 december 25 this way we have our baseline as well. Not that we're only starting with the end of 25
S Speaker 212:29and one, one question I have to is like, oh, and like, what's the big impact too? And I don't know how you think about it is like, one big part to why, why? The why the average CAC is relatively low, it's even like below, you know, like the enterprise CAC is because they have, still a huge portion. You can see here is like 15% of the increment AR is coming from the reseller, which basically has almost like no customer decision costs, right? Because it's not, they're not acquiring the customer, because the reseller is doing that essentially, so that that's also, like a very, very big takeaway, a contributing fact,
and one, one question I have to is like, oh, and like, what's the big impact too? And I don't know how you think about it is like, one big part to why, why? The why the average CAC is relatively low, it's even like below, you know, like the enterprise CAC is because they have, still a huge portion. You can see here is like 15% of the increment AR is coming from the reseller, which basically has almost like no customer decision costs, right?

Because it's not, they're not acquiring the customer, because the reseller is doing that essentially, so that that's also, like a very, very big takeaway, a contributing fact,
13:08that's a good one, yeah,
that's a good one, yeah,
that's a good one, yeah,
that's a good one, yeah,
S Speaker 213:09and then just like one, okay, I think I'm I think I'm good. I'm not going to change that one, one question I had when I realized, and just really quickly to get it's not okay? It's not
and then just like one, okay, I think I'm I think I'm good. I'm not going to change that one, one question I had when I realized, and just really quickly to get it's not okay? It's not
and then just like one, okay, I think I'm I think I'm good. I'm not going to change that one, one question I had when I realized, and just really quickly to get it's not okay? It's not
and then just like one, okay, I think I'm I think I'm good. I'm not going to change that one, one question I had when I realized, and just really quickly to get it's not okay? It's not
S Speaker 113:21100% true. And apples to apples, there's different ways where that kind of comes into play. It's not customer acquisition cost, it's margin stacking, right? You give up margin the same thing, right? That's That's your that's your cost, but it's not a direct customer, but that's what that's building,
100% true. And apples to apples, there's different ways where that kind of comes into play. It's not customer acquisition cost, it's margin stacking, right? You give up margin the same thing, right? That's That's your that's your cost, but it's not a direct customer, but that's what that's building,

That's That's your that's your cost, but it's not a direct customer, but that's what that's building,
13:38but that's good, that's put in our margin at the end of the day, exactly? Yeah,
but that's good, that's put in our margin at the end of the day, exactly? Yeah,
but that's good, that's put in our margin at the end of the day, exactly? Yeah,
but that's good, that's put in our margin at the end of the day, exactly? Yeah,
S Speaker 213:45exactly. They could just, you know, have low proceeds. And the only thing I realized here on the bottom, I don't know if that's a mistake, I think it's a mistake because I can't explain it. So when you look at, when you look at the CAC by unit segment, it's trailing. It's trailing. Okay,
exactly. They could just, you know, have low proceeds. And the only thing I realized here on the bottom, I don't know if that's a mistake, I think it's a mistake because I can't explain it. So when you look at, when you look at the CAC by unit segment, it's trailing. It's trailing. Okay,
exactly. They could just, you know, have low proceeds. And the only thing I realized here on the bottom, I don't know if that's a mistake, I think it's a mistake because I can't explain it. So when you look at, when you look at the CAC by unit segment, it's trailing. It's trailing. Okay,
exactly. They could just, you know, have low proceeds. And the only thing I realized here on the bottom, I don't know if that's a mistake, I think it's a mistake because I can't explain it. So when you look at, when you look at the CAC by unit segment, it's trailing. It's trailing. Okay,
S Speaker 114:02it did. That is the way it's done. They have. I it took me forever to figure that out. I started rejiggering the model to be like, this is all fucked up. But then I went through there, they actually have, they posted their methodology, and it did. It's, it's correct to look at it on a trailing so basically, because it's when you're acquiring that customer, not when you're get getting the revenue. So you've acquired the customer, you've issued the PO, and then you have a transition to revenues, right? So yes, it's kind of it. It's probably more accurate their way. It's more conservative. Also,
it did. That is the way it's done. They have. I it took me forever to figure that out. I started rejiggering the model to be like, this is all fucked up. But then I went through there, they actually have, they posted their methodology, and it did.

14:39okay, okay, because
S Speaker 114:41you spend a lot of money out here to acquire a customer, the revenues don't come in, right? So your, your LTP, right, takes, it's a longer window, yeah,
you spend a lot of money out here to acquire a customer, the revenues don't come in, right? So your, your LTP, right, takes, it's a longer window, yeah,
you spend a lot of money out here to acquire a customer, the revenues don't come in, right? So your, your LTP, right, takes, it's a longer window, yeah,
you spend a lot of money out here to acquire a customer, the revenues don't come in, right? So your, your LTP, right, takes, it's a longer window, yeah,
S Speaker 214:54but shouldn't that be the units also be trailing for that? I guess? No, I guess not. Right, no, yeah.
but shouldn't that be the units also be trailing for that? I guess? No, I guess not. Right, no, yeah.
but shouldn't that be the units also be trailing for that? I guess? No, I guess not. Right, no, yeah.
but shouldn't that be the units also be trailing for that? I guess? No, I guess not. Right, no, yeah.
S Speaker 115:04A long time I was like, I literally nearly rebuilt this entire piece. And then I was like, Oh, okay. I only understand, yeah,
A long time I was like, I literally nearly rebuilt this entire piece. And then I was like, Oh, okay. I only understand, yeah,
A long time I was like, I literally nearly rebuilt this entire piece. And then I was like, Oh, okay. I only understand, yeah,
A long time I was like, I literally nearly rebuilt this entire piece. And then I was like, Oh, okay. I only understand, yeah,
S Speaker 215:12okay. I just wanted to check that in. Okay, okay. I think, I think I make those little twists and add some some commentary, and then I think, let me know if you have any other I mean, if you feel like something is missing in the message to the Tushar, but I think that I don't know what else you could ask on to Shaw side, like, Did
okay. I just wanted to check that in. Okay, okay. I think, I think I make those little twists and add some some commentary, and then I think, let me know if you have any other I mean, if you feel like something is missing in the message to the Tushar, but I think that I don't know what else you could ask on to Shaw side, like, Did

S Speaker 215:40can take it out here. I can put, I just put it into, like, the existing deck.
can take it out here. I can put, I just put it into, like, the existing deck.
can take it out here. I can put, I just put it into, like, the existing deck.
can take it out here. I can put, I just put it into, like, the existing deck.
S Speaker 215:57it up. Okay, then I can then just drop it in there, yeah? And then you
it up. Okay, then I can then just drop it in there, yeah? And then you
it up. Okay, then I can then just drop it in there, yeah? And then you
it up. Okay, then I can then just drop it in there, yeah? And then you
S Speaker 116:01guys can tell me, you know, what do you we think is missing? What you know, what order is kind of right? I'm again, with this, really, the main question is around the competitive position. So a lot of this stuff is going to be at the top. The other stuff is largely ancillary. And then Priyesh, I think the only other pulling up the question chief, the other big one, right? There's maybe the pricing. I'm not sure how easy that is, and I found it hard to, like, break out discrete pricing, like one to one, because that's not the way they sell. But it would be like Tushar had a little bit of information on, like, they're not selling just a camera solution, right? Like, yeah,
guys can tell me, you know, what do you we think is missing? What you know, what order is kind of right? I'm again, with this, really, the main question is around the competitive position. So a lot of this stuff is going to be at the top. The other stuff is largely ancillary. And then Priyesh, I think the only other pulling up the question chief, the other big one, right?

guys can tell me, you know, what do you we think is missing? What you know, what order is kind of right? I'm again, with this, really, the main question is around the competitive position. So a lot of this stuff is going to be at the top. The other stuff is largely ancillary. And then Priyesh, I think the only other pulling up the question chief, the other big one, right? There's maybe the pricing. I'm not sure how easy that is, and I found it hard to, like, break out discrete pricing, like one to one, because that's not the way they sell. But it would be like Tushar had a little bit of information on, like, they're not selling just a camera solution, right? Like, yeah,
S Speaker 316:49there's a payments platform, there's datamatics, yeah,
there's a payments platform, there's datamatics, yeah,
there's a payments platform, there's datamatics, yeah,
there's a payments platform, there's datamatics, yeah,
S Speaker 116:52like, all this other stuff kind of baked in, which is a little different, right? They're up selling a camera versus where upselling connected vehicle. Yeah, right, like that. The $20 we're trying to get on connected vehicle is what they're currently selling today. And we're kind of going about it the same. Maybe the pricing is the same. I just couldn't quite make it out. If you can rate, if not, that's kind of a it's a question,
like, all this other stuff kind of baked in, which is a little different, right? They're up selling a camera versus where upselling connected vehicle. Yeah, right, like that. The $20 we're trying to get on connected vehicle is what they're currently selling today. And we're kind of going about it the same. Maybe the pricing is the same. I just couldn't quite make it out.

If you can rate, if not, that's kind of a it's a question,
S Speaker 317:19yeah, if I'm not able to find I haven't dig deeper on the pricing part yet rich. But if I'm not able to find the exact metrics, would you think it's okay to put them on a relative scale, probably as a horizontal line, and put them where they land? I
yeah, if I'm not able to find I haven't dig deeper on the pricing part yet rich. But if I'm not able to find the exact metrics, would you think it's okay to put them on a relative scale, probably as a horizontal line, and put them where they land? I

S Speaker 117:36wouldn't make stuff up. I'd rather just say, Fuck. I don't know it is what

it is what it is. And
it is what it is. And
it is what it is. And
S Speaker 117:45if you spend, spend some time on it, let's try to come up with our own view. Yeah, you are connected on the on the thread, with the with JP Morgan and stuff. Ask them the questions like, Hey, do you know? You know, but keep it succinct, right? You know, like motives some sort, and some Sarah's analytics is, you know, pricing, kind of in each of these categories where they compete, because they'll go to the company too and ask, yeah, well, it might take a little bit longer to get it back, but we can always follow up, you know, post stage two, because we're racing to kind of get a stage two done. Yeah, if stuff comes after. Stuff comes after. Like, even my diligence, I don't think I'll get it done by the customer calls done by Tuesday. May, may not, also may not make it into the deck. But such as life, right? Yeah, absolutely,

S Speaker 118:48And I think they have general stuff, but they will give you, like, pricing to say, like, our d4 100 SKU, right, is actually $40 a month. What is some sorrows, competitive skew price like is a cheap like by how much cheaper is it? So you are on the thread right? Priyesh with and Maria. It's creative, Maria, that send them a note say one, one more question, if

S Speaker 119:45insights out of them. I haven't had the only one we did. So I chatted with someone from a trucking company, just because I know them. They're not using metrody cameras. Actually, they're not using cameras. They're a small, small fleet operator. They would beat SMB, not even market. The other one is David and I met with platform sciences. I have the recording of the notes, but I don't have, I haven't like written the OCR is terrible, like, you'll never understand what's written there. I can, I'll send it to you if you want to, like, but it's a lot of, like, coffee talk and junk as well.

They're interested in operational efficiencies, right? Like they are a traditional PE company. They're not cutting edge. They're not even trying to push cutting edge. Yeah,

these points already made it to your notes that you had put there, rich already, right? So, okay,
S Speaker 121:35got it, yeah, yeah. It's consistent with with that. So I'll have a blurb or two of that, like in the slides, as far as kind of customer calls, but there's a couple of others. So we haven't done Loomis yet. We haven't done Frito Lay yet. We'll get them. They just make, might not make this deck, which is fine. I mean,
got it, yeah, yeah. It's consistent with with that. So I'll have a blurb or two of that, like in the slides, as far as kind of customer calls, but there's a couple of others.

S Speaker 122:23think my plan is on Sunday we can send the IC deck to Carlos and Nancy, right for like the initial review, right? David and yourself, you're going to review your own slides as well as I'll probably post the stage two slides maybe Sunday night. And if there's holes, there's holes, but at least people have the skeleton. And, you know, Monday, if we update, it great, but Tuesday morning is the thing. So I just want to make sure people have time to at least say they were in there since Sunday. You know, you've had your two days to review, right? Yes, there'll be changes, but you know, largely, this is most of it. So what

23:04is the IC again,
S Speaker 123:08Friday or Friday? But Nancy wanted the slides, I think by Wednesday, but it's you and Carlos. Need to review it. You Nancy and Carlos, right? And then Quinn reviews on Wednesday, yeah, Friday will present it, yep, yeah. I'm less worried about because they're super generic, right? Like, I don't want to say no one cares what's but those are just like, high level slides. We're not answering any questions. We're basically just saying, This is what it is. This is this is the deal. This is the product. We're working together. We think it's a good investment, good good

S Speaker 223:42stage stage one slides were only pretty, pretty, pretty good compared to, like, you know, usually stage ones are, like, more heavy on context and stuff was already pretty much, you know, summarized a lot. So I think, right, it's totally fine, yeah,
stage stage one slides were only pretty, pretty, pretty good compared to, like, you know, usually stage ones are, like, more heavy on context and stuff was already pretty much, you know, summarized a lot. So I think, right, it's totally fine, yeah,

S Speaker 123:55yeah. Well, that's what this is going to look like, right? The Stage two is just going to be basically answering questions. We're not, like presenting a a nice deck, right? It's just kind of like each slide answers questions we're not going to spend a lot of time on, on the like, the fluffy stuff of this is what the company is. This is what whatever. Okay,
yeah. Well, that's what this is going to look like, right? The Stage two is just going to be basically answering questions. We're not, like presenting a a nice deck, right?

S Speaker 124:35In our chat is fine. It doesn't matter, wherever you know you posted, it's just so we just so we have a working, you know, this way we can look at it, review it together, yeah, that one, yeah, I think it's easier. Just needs to be basically a little more concise than my original slides, right? We can take out some of the fluffy wordy stuff for this wording. Yeah, when I, when I write slides, Quint doesn't like that.
In our chat is fine.

S Speaker 125:19presenting to the IC, I'm less worried about. We know the story, it's right, and they don't need all that they don't need, or want all
presenting to the IC, I'm less worried about. We know the story, it's right, and they don't need all that they don't need, or want all

S Speaker 225:26the details. No. And we already, we already talked to, I had a meeting with Taylor Quinn and Taylor, I met not so long ago, like a week or so ago. We already pitched Petro, basically, and he kind of, he liked it very much. So it's, yeah, we wanted on all the deals, lambda and etc. Like, kind of, because there were so many deals coming up, we kind of gave him, like, a heads up, so to say, and we went through like, you know, five minutes to each of the ones that are coming in the dry, obviously, was one of them. So I think he's not, like, gonna be like, so surprised, like, Hey, what's going on here? And the fact that they're using our platform. And then there's like, a prior Qualcomm, etc, that's kind of like, I think he was what, like, it's kind of like, exactly like,
