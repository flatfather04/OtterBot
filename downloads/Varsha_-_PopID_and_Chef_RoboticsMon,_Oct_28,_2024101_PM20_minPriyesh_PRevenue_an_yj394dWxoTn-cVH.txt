S Speaker 10:01Right? Yeah, I told him that you should just look at it as a three year thing, okay? And not to a six year. So that's one area to drill down upon, the second area, so that's on the gross margin. The second area to drill down upon is then just the build up of the top line, you know? So the the I have sent you a link, and in that link you will find a model. But he was updating a model because he joined one of his customers. Okay, so the model right now is going, it's right now, it's around 3.7 million, yeah, let me just see if I have the old model here. And he he basically does 3x 3x 2x 2x
Right? Yeah, I told him that you should just look at it as a three year thing, okay? And not to a six year. So that's one area to drill down upon, the second area, so that's on the gross margin.

But he was updating a model because he joined one of his customers. Okay, so the model right now is going, it's right now, it's around 3.7 million, yeah, let me just see if I have the old model here. And he he basically does 3x 3x 2x 2x
Right? Yeah, I told him that you should just look at it as a three year thing, okay? And not to a six year. So that's one area to drill down upon, the second area, so that's on the gross margin.

S Speaker 13:10If you just assume a 7x comp, then
If you just assume a 7x comp, then
If you just assume a 7x comp, then
If you just assume a 7x comp, then
3:14one second, it's 100
S Speaker 13:16million. Post, right now, okay, okay, we put in five and so this is a rough calculation of 80% ownership at IPO, yeah, okay, assuming the ownership stays, so it's about 4% right? And here I've kept the seven as the comp for robotics, so you need to just look at the comp for robotics. So the Boston Dynamics guys are low, but the current private guys are locus and I will send you. There are two private guys who are actually doing it at 20x okay, revenue multiple, okay. So what we need to do is, we need to see whether we can get here.

S Speaker 14:05feel, I have this intuitive feeling about him, that he will do well. However, it needs to be proven with numbers, with lot of skeptics. Yeah, right, so a lot of skeptics, so we need to basically just focus on, can we get here?

6:18Does that any questions?

Does that any questions?
Does that any questions?
S Speaker 26:19That sounds good. Varsha, so Tam, comps and revenue. Do you want me to focus on? Let's say the working capital. How do we plan to how do they finance it, the payback period, things like that. Cops, okay, yeah.
That sounds good. Varsha, so Tam, comps and revenue. Do you want me to focus on? Let's say the working capital. How do we plan to how do they finance it, the payback period, things like that. Cops, okay, yeah.

S Speaker 16:34So you know, the rope I had put in the all that in the state, in the prospect deck. Yeah, right. So verify some of that. Okay, okay, so we need to figure out payback, with and without financing. We need to figure out the gross margin. So slide seven has some of that data. Yeah. And then the like I said, the gross margin just look through, because if it is done with the six year number, then it doesn't make sense.

S Speaker 17:06When Carlos met with him, he was like, Well, this is Carlos is saying that, look, you're projecting 140 our boss will just ask us to cut into half 70 million, right? And so we just need to figure out whether this sort of makes sense. I think we can project it out to be $100 million business, but then we have to find the right set of comps to say, Okay, this will be more than 7x Yeah? Or, basically, we have to make that math work, yeah, yeah. If it is at 7x it has to get 220 you know the Yes, yes, I get what you're saying. Totally, yeah. And he has enough. He will, you know, he has a full handle on the business. So the CEO is very good. You can ask him, whatever, and then he should be able to provide you with anything. And I'll be on email. It just, I'll be on a different time zone, yeah. So if there's any issue or anything you please let me know. I will ask him, but the goal will be that we just give some comfort right palms. You can get them right. You don't need his time for cops, absolutely. And then the even the cam, he's actually just looked through the deck. It's actually pretty detailed he's done. And also the PDF that I sent, yeah, from prospect has a whole bunch of data in it as well on who are the other players, etc. So you'll get a feel for it. You don't have to spend time on the competition, right? You know, to spend time on the management team, yeah, the financing

S Speaker 28:37on the numbers, yeah, I get that. Sure Russia, right? Definitely make
on the numbers, yeah, I get that. Sure Russia, right? Definitely make

on the numbers, yeah, I get that. Sure Russia, right? Definitely make
S Speaker 18:41sense. Okay, the second one, which I want to make you aware of, and this may or may not, let me just, let me just send you the old model, so that I don't forget to send it to you, and he's going to update everything, and that's why, you know the model will get updated. This model shows that he has 100 million from existing customers, yeah, but now it's down to now it's down to 17 because one of them is churning. Okay, so some of those things you will have to, you will have to look into churn, etc. Currently there's no CAC because there's two people who do the selling, okay, no significant customer acquisition cost. Okay.
sense. Okay, the second one, which I want to make you aware of, and this may or may not, let me just, let me just send you the old model, so that I don't forget to send it to you, and he's going to update everything, and that's why, you know the model will get updated.

Okay.
S Speaker 19:40Okay, just send the model. Okay, all right. So now you have model, you have the link to the deck, and you have my prospect FYI sheet, right? Yeah, okay, sounds good. And then I will, I think the only other thing I may have are some old robotics. Comes one second, if I have them, I will just
Okay, just send the model. Okay, all right. So now you have model, you have the link to the deck, and you have my prospect FYI sheet, right? Yeah, okay, sounds good. And then I will, I think the only other thing I may have are some old robotics. Comes one second, if I have them, I will just

10:15let me see I had done. Gotten something from
let me see I had done. Gotten something from
let me see I had done. Gotten something from
let me see I had done. Gotten something from
S Speaker 110:19from one of the bankers A while ago, on in general,
from one of the bankers A while ago, on in general,
from one of the bankers A while ago, on in general,
from one of the bankers A while ago, on in general,
10:26robotic comms. But
10:47Yeah, I'll do my set of research on that. So
Yeah, I'll do my set of research on that. So
Yeah, I'll do my set of research on that. So
Yeah, I'll do my set of research on that. So
S Speaker 110:50the ones to look at is locus. Locus is doing very well. They seem to be going out at 20x Arr, okay, and the other one was symbolic, or something like that. I'll send you the name, okay, okay, sounds good. And in this one, we have a plot to participate. Yeah, I have created the opportunity, and there's a second closing window. So I think all that is sorted. All our terms are sorted now, just whether it is something we can get Quinn over the line. I feel like I said, my feeling is we can, but I think it's going to be a it has to be proven with numbers and stuff. And you will see, once you meet the guy, you know, there's a lot of there's a lot behind him, is why I feel it's probably possible. And the current lead investor, their main advisor, is from one of the US robotics companies, and they put them through a big ringer of everything. So I can, we can get some of that data as well, but we should just make up our own mind first. Yeah, about is purely valuation. On this one correct, purely valuation. The second deal is called Pop ID, yeah, and this is quite similar to your Hi, Fi, except it's on the payment side.
the ones to look at is locus. Locus is doing very well. They seem to be going out at 20x Arr, okay, and the other one was symbolic, or something like that.

S Speaker 212:12I remember very early when I was here, I probably did some comparables or competitive analysis for this. So I remember this company. Okay,
I remember very early when I was here, I probably did some comparables or competitive analysis for this. So I remember this company. Okay,
I remember very early when I was here, I probably did some comparables or competitive analysis for this. So I remember this company. Okay,
I remember very early when I was here, I probably did some comparables or competitive analysis for this. So I remember this company. Okay,
13:23move the transaction
S Speaker 113:28rails. So I will just show you what that is, and this one may have a shorter timeline to the decision than chef. Okay, if, if people feel okay. So I'll just tell you how, how their model is. This is only the JP Morgan model. Yeah. So they have a lead term sheet from JP Morgan, and this is assuming JP Morgan's only, JP Morgan led business only, okay. Now, the way this works is they have a bunch of customers through J So JP Morgan acquires a whole bunch of merchants. Now these merchants will now have biometrics. So you then figure out how many of these biometrics. So these are the number of checkouts. Is the measure that they use. How many people will actually use it? One user may use it multiple times, right? And then they have a ratio of, sort of self explanatory here. And so the way it works is, in the end, it comes to the amount of money they'll make, okay? So this is how much you may pay on an average for a biometric transaction. And so this is the total gross payment volume. GPB is gross payment value, and then they have given how many of these margins will be acquired through this network, okay? And there's a percentage of that, and there's a percentage of split. And this is where it gets interesting, as to how many of them use a card versus how many are now can be moved to the proprietary payment network, okay, so ACH is their proprietary payment network. If you come to the proprietary payment network, then they get more money, yeah, than the card. So that's the simple math, okay, and so this is where you have the ACH versus card, and then you have how this flows down to basically revenue, okay, okay, it's very simple business model, right? Okay, and this, and then there are some other costs associated with it, etc, but that's really the the model. And so the top line with JP Morgan is,
rails. So I will just show you what that is, and this one may have a shorter timeline to the decision than chef. Okay, if, if people feel okay. So I'll just tell you how, how their model is. This is only the JP Morgan model. Yeah. So they have a lead term sheet from JP Morgan, and this is assuming JP Morgan's only, JP Morgan led business only, okay.

GPB is gross payment value, and then they have given how many of these margins will be acquired through this network, okay? And there's a percentage of that, and there's a percentage of split. And this is where it gets interesting, as to how many of them use a card versus how many are now can be moved to the proprietary payment network, okay, so ACH is their proprietary payment network. If you come to the proprietary payment network, then they get more money, yeah, than the card. So that's the simple math, okay, and so this is where you have the ACH versus card, and then you have how this flows down to basically revenue, okay, okay, it's very simple business model, right? Okay, and this, and then there are some other costs associated with it, etc, but that's really the the model. And so the top line with JP Morgan is,
rails. So I will just show you what that is, and this one may have a shorter timeline to the decision than chef. Okay, if, if people feel okay. So I'll just tell you how, how their model is. This is only the JP Morgan model. Yeah. So they have a lead term sheet from JP Morgan, and this is assuming JP Morgan's only, JP Morgan led business only, okay. Now, the way this works is they have a bunch of customers through J So JP Morgan acquires a whole bunch of merchants. Now these merchants will now have biometrics. So you then figure out how many of these biometrics. So these are the number of checkouts. Is the measure that they use. How many people will actually use it? One user may use it multiple times, right? And then they have a ratio of, sort of self explanatory here. And so the way it works is, in the end, it comes to the amount of money they'll make, okay? So this is how much you may pay on an average for a biometric transaction. And so this is the total gross payment volume. GPB is gross payment value, and then they have given how many of these margins will be acquired through this network, okay? And there's a percentage of that, and there's a percentage of split.

Okay, and this, and then there are some other costs associated with it, etc, but that's really the the model. And so the top line with JP Morgan is,
15:37is this? Okay? They
S Speaker 115:39get to a $50 million top line with JP Morgan, and then they have given the ACH margin. They've given everything as to how this whole thing works. Okay, yeah. And now they have other opportunities, like the one with their own GTM. They're going to Middle East as well. So it's bunch of these opportunities as well to look into. And again, I have done the analysis of why them versus an apple, so you don't have to go there. Similar exercise here as well is looking at this business. How long will it? Let's assume it takes longer, because payment behavior takes longer. And then the other wrinkle here is the ACH, okay, wrinkle, okay, because that's the more of a revenue driver. The team is very good. There's no issue with that. So we should just figure out whether it makes financial sense or not, right?

S Speaker 216:36And for this questions on this one, for this we have the JP Morgan model. And do we have their own financial models as well? Version?

Yeah. So they are, they have not yet
Yeah. So they are, they have not yet
Yeah. So they are, they have not yet
S Speaker 116:44sent it to me, because they changed it now. Okay, so I am, I'm waiting to get that from them. They are running a little crazy now, because finally, their deal is come together, yeah. So I'm not he, he's, I think he may become bit more responsive in a little while, but let me just send you the stuff. I have his model. I have forwarded you his model, I'm as in JP Morgan model,
sent it to me, because they changed it now. Okay, so I am, I'm waiting to get that from them. They are running a little crazy now, because finally, their deal is come together, yeah.

17:12and you may need,
S Speaker 117:16you may have to get his time for his other model as well, and I'm forwarding you the business unit, what they did as A model, okay for
you may have to get his time for his other model as well, and I'm forwarding you the business unit, what they did as A model, okay for

S Speaker 117:41so he will give you access, and then you should be all set. I'm still in this time in all the Eastern Time Zone till tomorrow evening. It is that I'll be trained and whatnot. Yeah, so we can connect again tomorrow. Okay, just take a look, and then we can also figure out how much time? Because I'm sure you have many other things to do. So we can figure out the time allocation. No,
so he will give you access, and then you should be all set. I'm still in this time in all the Eastern Time Zone till tomorrow evening. It is that I'll be trained and whatnot.

18:05absolutely I can. I can get these to learn for sure.
absolutely I can. I can get these to learn for sure.
absolutely I can. I can get these to learn for sure.
absolutely I can. I can get these to learn for sure.
S Speaker 118:09Okay. And again, timeline wise, we can have slightly longer window on chef. It's just that it will take longer time to,
Okay. And again, timeline wise, we can have slightly longer window on chef. It's just that it will take longer time to,
Okay. And again, timeline wise, we can have slightly longer window on chef. It's just that it will take longer time to,

yeah, get everyone on board. Okay, yeah, get
yeah, get everyone on board. Okay, yeah, get
S Speaker 118:19everyone on board and that we hit Thanksgiving and whatnot, right? So I think just see if we can get to the numbers.
everyone on board and that we hit Thanksgiving and whatnot, right? So I think just see if we can get to the numbers.
everyone on board and that we hit Thanksgiving and whatnot, right? So I think just see if we can get to the numbers.
everyone on board and that we hit Thanksgiving and whatnot, right? So I think just see if we can get to the numbers.
S Speaker 218:28Okay, okay, I'll get started on pop Id first, and then start doing chef, probably by Wednesday. Okay,
Okay, okay, I'll get started on pop Id first, and then start doing chef, probably by Wednesday. Okay,
Okay, okay, I'll get started on pop Id first, and then start doing chef, probably by Wednesday. Okay,
Okay, okay, I'll get started on pop Id first, and then start doing chef, probably by Wednesday. Okay,
18:35that's totally okay. And they're both simple, you know,
that's totally okay. And they're both simple, you know,
that's totally okay. And they're both simple, you know,
that's totally okay. And they're both simple, you know,
S Speaker 118:38they're not, they're not as complex and pop ID, I don't know yet whether everybody is still, like, only looking for this criteria, or it's still hung up on the Syndicate, right? Just so you know, yeah, okay, Chef, there's no issue with syndicate. There's no issue. None of those is purely evaluation, right? Here it is also the syndicate. So this may or may not move, just keeping you sort of updated on, on, on where things may so if you need to just sort of prioritize, yeah,
they're not, they're not as complex and pop ID, I don't know yet whether everybody is still, like, only looking for this criteria, or it's still hung up on the Syndicate, right?
