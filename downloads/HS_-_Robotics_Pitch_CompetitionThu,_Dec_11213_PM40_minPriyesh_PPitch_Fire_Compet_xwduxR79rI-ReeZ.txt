S Speaker 10:00Presentation. As much as it's going to be many presentations, we're going to do a little pitch fire competition. So we have leave five or 615, we're each going to be presenting pitch. We're going to limit them to five minutes each, and how to use that time is up to them. If they want to use a little bit for Q and A. I think that's advisable, but it's up to them how to use it. So we can get a five at a time out here for our for our different pitch bar participants, and who's going to be up first. This is our first victim. Please come on. You have a microphone. There's a microphone.

So you'll have five minutes and let me know if you need anything.
S Speaker 20:53Yes, perfect. Preview. All right, I won. I was told I have, but yeah, if there are any questions afterwards, I'll be building this. So we are oId, and we're an early stage startup, and basically, from a high level, what you're doing is you're building modular humanitarian now, I think it's very obvious in this group that human rights are going to be massive over the next few years. They're going to be everywhere in every industry. And to go from, you know, full levels that we see today to actually deploying human lives at scale in the real world, we're Is There a manual

2:07Let me describe it.
S Speaker 22:09So the first one is actually what happens when things break in human rights. So, you know, human rights are like any machine. Things break a bunch of time and they need

other time. So actually, what usually happens is The robot is offline. Closed customers.
S Speaker 22:57We and what that means is that downtime goes from and what this also means is that they are adaptable, so we can easily adapt them to any industry. So if you want to deploy them in hospital or on a farm or even in, you know, manufacturing, we can adapt them for that industry. Now the second thing I want to talk about is supply chain risk, and this is something I think is not talked about enough. We all know what happened with the drone industry. And humanoid robots are no different. If you want to deploy them in, for example, government or critical industries, they need to be secure. And actually, that is why we are based entirely in Japan. So I think everyone here in this room can agree that Japan is known for its trusted manufacturing network. They have world class industry. We are already partnered with major manufacturers in Japan, and we also have connections with the Japanese government to manufacture humanoids entirely in Japan. And we also want to open the door to other US companies that want to get involved here. So if anyone here is a company that is looking to source components from their patent, please come and talk to us afterwards. We would love to have a chat.

S Speaker 24:40I'll just really quickly go through it. So this is, on a high level, how our team looks like currency. My background is in cyber security and government, in the industry, government, infrastructure and my I've spent the past three years. So as my co founder Simon, who has spent seven years working at Big robotics companies like panruk, Tokyo robotics and also Waseda. And we have top talent now from unicorns such as zipline, and we're currently growing massively. So actually, if you are either an engineer or an investor, we would love to talk to you. We have a QR code as the last slide. So that's our website. If anyone is interested, please come and talk to us. We will be at the JETRO booth and also at the VIP lab, and I think we have 30 seconds for questions. So if anyone has one question, one quick question,

S Speaker 36:10micro factory. This is a general purpose robot to automate manual vehicle, top work, and we started this electronic assembly. Next slide please. So is. So there is quite a big milestone happens in the last couple months in the robotic so the method for increasing success rate for VOA models finally start to work. And you use this reinforcement journey with human connections to achieve your 100% of success rate on wide range of tasks with only couple hours of data, quite an important series. But the problem with this is that if you choose your model for specific workspace, it will work on good only in this workspace. So how to scale? And our solution is that our robot is a workspace, so it's shipped in this box frame. It's a controlled, standardized environment, and once you drain it, once you can replicate this seduct to any amount of losses. And of course, we say we run our model baseball of the game smarter, but even now, you can scale it and it can be useful. So we we so we got our 100 pages relations pause the box, and got inbound request from top 10 fortune customer who want to assemble their products using our products. We signed with NDA, so we will announce it later. So we don't see a lot of risks in on the demand side of the startups, because everyone with whom we talk to, they want to reduce costs, so it's the obvious solution for them. So the risk is to make it work. And in last five months, we build robot and specific set of tools to improve the success rate. And voila, military of the UA bonds specifically on this precise you precise work needed for electronic assembly. So benefits of general purpose robot, of humanoids and our robot, the total market is huge because you tackle different areas. For example, our customers want to use it for food processing, for jewelry, textile, web automation a part of this electronic assembly our use case, and we was my co founder, were owners of manufacturing company for about nine years. And so we understand this problem of manual electronic assembly, and we know how to build hardware and robots in particular, and about half a year ago, we raised the ground from some of the top angels, and now we prepared the sea ground to start mass production of our lot. This is my email. Feel free to reach out with any questions. And if you have any questions now, I will go further.

I think of a factory, I think of in Cuca arms, very large format. So small,
S Speaker 310:15yeah, so basically, when you have some electronics, it's usually a small scale, so there is no reason to buy off the shelf big industrial arms that exist on the market. That's why we build all arms specifically for this use case. And in this way, we optimize price and optimize the space that it takes in the facility. So it's just from the demand and from the problem itself.

S Speaker 110:45You see, it's used for assembling things like very small electronics. Just curious, what are some of the other use cases?

You see, it's used for assembling things like very small electronics. Just curious, what are some of the other use cases?
S Speaker 310:55Yeah, so apart from electronics, it can assemble basically any product of this size, and usually we focus it on file assembly, so you can outsource parts. But when you do file assembly, you can control quality, and you control your IP rights, you outsource it to any other country or factory. So this is quite important step, and we focus on this and our customers. They just send us messages with their pre orders. For what reason do they want to use it for what purpose? And it's on the second place. It's a food processor and wide range of different tasks, like textile jewelry, lab automation,

S Speaker 411:41great question over here, we have one question, yes. Last question is, like from a customer base? Are you looking to do this for commercial and residential selling base? Right? Because it's a micro factory, it could be like in a house or something like that, create a mom and pop shop. So is that something you guys are considering or thinking about,

S Speaker 512:52Hello, everyone. We are morale. We make Ultra bass charging battery systems for robotics applications. A large part of our team is from the EV world. So much vehicle world, where we built battery packs for large companies like General Motors, Facebook, Google, BMW, and one of the topics that always came up as important was recharge time. So in the EV world, evolution of the EV world, a lot of companies came along and,

S Speaker 513:51there were companies that emerged to offer battery swapping as a method to solve recharge times. And so companies like better place and ample they came along and tried to say, well, we're going to swap out the entire battery pack of your car and replace it with a new one. But these companies all have ultimately failed because of the cost and complexity associated with with that, and what we see now is a supercharger network like Tesla's to solve that problem. And the reason why I bring this up is that robots are kind of facing that same sort of problem. A lot of companies we see today are immediately kind of gravitating towards battery swapping without understanding the consequences of doing that in terms of costs and complexity as they scale. So here's an example of a robot that may cost $20,000 up front, but then over the course of five years, we'll endure $18,000 in additional operating expense just associated with battery swapping. We think that's too much. So at Morel, we've developed a ultra fast charging battery system that charges the battery in under 15 minutes, and more importantly, reduces that $18,000 to $6,000 over the course of five years. And so the next question is, how do we do that? Well, we have three components to our technology. First, we start with silicon based systems and lithium ion batteries. So the chemistry is really, really important to achieving this high charge, high pass charge system. We have a unique battery pack designed that handles thermal properties of a battery pack. And then third, we have machine learning algorithm that improves the charge of charge protocol over time. So you end up with this area, a fully customizable battery pack with BMS and smart charge included. Here's an example of a battery that we've deployed to a humanoid customer. Importantly, this battery pack is now undergoing ul 2271 certification. We think that it's going to be the first battery pack that has been certified according to ul 2071 with that fast charge capability. And you know, we're obviously proponents of fast charging, but we understand that every system and every company is different and that you can involve any battery swapping in certain situations. But what is very clear is that robots are consuming more power, more energy than they're originally designed, and understanding the balance between the robot capacity, acceptable downtime and cost is super important. We feel like fast charging can be an important tool in this optimization process. So questions,

S Speaker 416:31are there any questions? I got a question for you. You mentioned that it's fully customizable, or module in that case, right? So are you guys thinking about like impact resistant, like, these machines are going to be put through the runner, right? So, like, typically what I see on batteries are in robotic systems.

S Speaker 516:55we like to work with the customer, with the customer, like you mentioned, fully customizable. It really depends on where the cavity is that they're trying to insert this battery. Whether it's removable or not removable makes a difference too. We build cases, I guess, that are both classic carbon and aluminum.

S Speaker 618:24So I'm James. I'm the co founder and CEO of animo at ademo. We're accelerating robot deployment with tele operation. There are really two tailwinds to play. Firstly, we've got better AI models. So advances in AI making general purpose robotics in complex environments possible. We're seeing increased autonomy. And then on the other side, we're seeing cheaper and cheaper human robots. Humans that maybe cost $100,000 a few years ago are going to cost 10, $20,000 next year, $5,000 the year after. And that trajectory is only going to increase over time, opening up, opening up more and more commercial applications for humanoids, good data constraints in limiting humanoid autonomy. While language models have the internet to train on, there is no internet for robotics, which means that robotic companies are going to or need to go out and complain and create large quantities of diverse data. It's time consuming. There's a lack of coverage in a world with infinite edge cases, how do you actually get visibility into that data? And then finally, real world complexity. Simulating reality is difficult, and while synthetic data has its place, we're still heavily reliant on real world data to train autonomous systems. Teleoperation is that bridge between where we are today and full autonomy, whether it's autonomous vehicles or complex manipulation tasks, everybody is using heavy operation and sometimes more successfully than other times.

19:52Okay, that's not going to play.
Okay, that's not going to play.
Okay, that's not going to play.
Okay, that's not going to play.
S Speaker 619:56Let's get past that. So what is 10 operation? When you're accelerating your time to market, you don't need to wait for full time to actually deploy your robot. We've seen companies like 1x for example, they're aiming to deploy 10,000 robots into people's homes by the end of next year, and able to scale that by more than an order of magnitude the year after. Why they're doing this? Well, it's going to give them access to unparalleled data that other robotics companies just don't have, and they're going to have higher levels of autonomy, which which is a mode and, of course, Quick Time to revenue. And secondly, filling gaps in real world environments with infinite edge cases. Real World variability is just too high fully autonomous systems to handle without human intervention. So what do we do at remote we do two things. We provide remote teleoperation for real world deployment. We have two business lines. We have dedicated telegram facilities. We currently have 700 teleoperators in Mexico City providing low latency, high quality teleportation. And then we build low latency teleportation systems as well. There only two solutions. If you want to run tele Corporation yourself, you can either do it yourself or outsource to an outsourced company. You're doing yourself now, Company Incorporation. This is not incorporating the states. This is in places like Mexico. You're doing in Asia, maybe places like the Philippines. It's not easy. Real Estate, leases, hiring pipelines, training, pipelines, workforce management, technical infrastructure, scheduling management, it's a pain, or you can outsource to a BPO. Most BPO centers are in places like India or Philippines. You have latency issues. You have poor table training, poor operator management, lack of infrastructure control, and then connectivity challenges and power supply interventions, which aren't great when you've got deployed visa protocols. I pulled some quotes from conversations I've had with companies with large patios. So this is a company that uses a BPO. They agree to roster a certain number of staff. They don't guarantee that they wouldn't turn up for work. This is from a guy that was running three and a half 1000 tele operators across Costa Rica in India, they wound down the India teleop, we definitely see a significant degradation of high performance because latency when you're traveling long distances. And finally, an operator who was repacking a customer's toes. So this was a company doing manipulation using robotic arms, spent eight minutes doing it, or we would expect a typical intervention to be in low 10s of seconds. Low quality time operation leads to low quality data. Adeno is fixing time operation. We provide high quality time operation. For the fastest growing remote these companies, we have more strategically located facilities. So for all the US employments, we have some 100 milliseconds round trip time from operator to robot back and of course, uptime. Our facilities are set up in a way to guarantee both network and power up time, so that could be ups and dies on power generators. One of our facilities, we have eight ISPs running into the facility providing 10 gigabit per second network failovers. We want to minimize latency as much as possible. If latency hits certain thresholds, we can move over to separate ISPs do optimal routing. And of course, it's 24/7 we make it possible for robotics companies to deploy it in weeks or months. We understand what our clients requirements are, I flew near yesterday from from Mexico City. I speak to a humanoid company. They need two and a half 1000 operators by the next year. We take that we understand their hardware requirements. We put together our recruitment process, we put together a training pipeline we can go by, and we can do that in this three weeks. The bottleneck in robotics is really shifting from research and development and manufacturing to real world deployment, and that's where we fit in. So join us accelerating the deployment frameworks.

I pulled some quotes from conversations I've had with companies with large patios. So this is a company that uses a BPO. They agree to roster a certain number of staff. They don't guarantee that they wouldn't turn up for work. This is from a guy that was running three and a half 1000 tele operators across Costa Rica in India, they wound down the India teleop, we definitely see a significant degradation of high performance because latency when you're traveling long distances. And finally, an operator who was repacking a customer's toes. So this was a company doing manipulation using robotic arms, spent eight minutes doing it, or we would expect a typical intervention to be in low 10s of seconds. Low quality time operation leads to low quality data. Adeno is fixing time operation. We provide high quality time operation. For the fastest growing remote these companies, we have more strategically located facilities. So for all the US employments, we have some 100 milliseconds round trip time from operator to robot back and of course, uptime. Our facilities are set up in a way to guarantee both network and power up time, so that could be ups and dies on power generators. One of our facilities, we have eight ISPs running into the facility providing 10 gigabit per second network failovers. We want to minimize latency as much as possible. If latency hits certain thresholds, we can move over to separate ISPs do optimal routing. And of course, it's 24/7 we make it possible for robotics companies to deploy it in weeks or months. We understand what our clients requirements are, I flew near yesterday from from Mexico City. I speak to a humanoid company. They need two and a half 1000 operators by the next year. We take that we understand their hardware requirements. We put together our recruitment process, we put together a training pipeline we can go by, and we can do that in this three weeks. The bottleneck in robotics is really shifting from research and development and manufacturing to real world deployment, and that's where we fit in. So join us accelerating the deployment frameworks. Thank
Let's get past that. So what is 10 operation? When you're accelerating your time to market, you don't need to wait for full time to actually deploy your robot. We've seen companies like 1x for example, they're aiming to deploy 10,000 robots into people's homes by the end of next year, and able to scale that by more than an order of magnitude the year after. Why they're doing this? Well, it's going to give them access to unparalleled data that other robotics companies just don't have, and they're going to have higher levels of autonomy, which which is a mode and, of course, Quick Time to revenue. And secondly, filling gaps in real world environments with infinite edge cases. Real World variability is just too high fully autonomous systems to handle without human intervention. So what do we do at remote we do two things. We provide remote teleoperation for real world deployment. We have two business lines. We have dedicated telegram facilities. We currently have 700 teleoperators in Mexico City providing low latency, high quality teleportation. And then we build low latency teleportation systems as well. There only two solutions. If you want to run tele Corporation yourself, you can either do it yourself or outsource to an outsourced company. You're doing yourself now, Company Incorporation. This is not incorporating the states. This is in places like Mexico. You're doing in Asia, maybe places like the Philippines. It's not easy. Real Estate, leases, hiring pipelines, training, pipelines, workforce management, technical infrastructure, scheduling management, it's a pain, or you can outsource to a BPO.

Are you just providing the teleoperation actually within or you're coming back and actually labeling that tele operational data so that they can be actually used for some type of pre training or easily accessible.

S Speaker 624:27It's a good question. In the long term, we think there are benefits from doing data cleaning enabling as part of the teleoperation process, and we are seeing some customers do that with things like pedals, for example, for task segmentation. Right now, focus is just on scaling the teleportation set aside. But I think long term, getting to the data side is Something that to the data is something thank you guys.

S Speaker 939:25So we have a quality metrics. So four months back, our data processing pipeline was an 84% accuracy when converted into models. Right now, it's like 92% accuracy. So we are improving that data so this involves more collection of data sets, more GPUs and more storage. We train our models on around 250 each, 200 GPUs as today, but as we get more funding, we'll be expanding that training to much, much larger levels.
