S Speaker 10:00That's what we do. What we do is we provide large scale GPU infrastructure machine learning models. So machine learning creating foundation size machine learning models. It's kind of like yourself. You look for GPUs. So before I get into the nitty gritty of the product, here we have my two co founders. We got Joshua and my love Joshua CTO, and he's done some pretty cool machine learning work at companies like Apple and the shamsacra initiative. Noche is our CPO big dog, and he's done some pretty cool machine learning work at companies like Google, DeepMind and Mexico, probably a little bit more on the finance side of the machine learning world. And I've worked at companies like Blackstone and picked up. So something we've noticed in all of our machine learning roles is as ml developers in academia and industry, we found an absolute pain in the ass to orchestrate and use GPUs. It was absolutely ridiculous. Like 40% of our day we spent just like orchestrating GPUs. So we're building exactly what we wish we had as machine learning engineers. Tensor pool, the easiest way to train machine learning models on the cloud. So we handle all the infrastructure, the GPU orchestration and the insights, enabling machine learning developers to 10x their iteration speed. Not only is it super easy to use, but it's also pretty cheap, so we can save our users around 50% on GPU spend, and this is because we developed some pretty cool in house software, reservation tech. So we noticed that machine learning infrastructure space is at a bit of an inflection point right now, there's so many hyperscalers providing compute, but there's no company that makes it super easy to access and orchestrate these machines, and that's what we're doing. So it's kind of like Purcell. I'm not sure if you guys are familiar with this company, but what they did is they made it super easy to web host. We're doing the exact same thing, but for GPUs, we only launched three months ago, and we already have some pretty solid traction. We have over 1000 user signups, over 3000 models trained, and upwards of 150 models per person. As of this past month, we also hit 50k MRR, which we're pretty happy about. Thank you so much. You

Hi, I'm Angel. I'm Bill develes. Ai to eliminate medical bills through health insurance.
S Speaker 22:52for me. I've been dealing with a chronic knee injury for the past decade. I've now had three surgeries on my right knee, and I've had to fight down over a quarter million dollars related charges possible. Medical bills are extremely complex, and patients are left in the dark. Up to 80% of medical bills have errors, and only point 2% of people actually write back. This has created a massive issue where 100 million Americans have benefit and is the leading cause of personal bankruptcy in the United States, we've seen dozens of startups and patient advocacy groups trying to tackle this problem for years, but nobody has been able to scale their impact meaningfully, because unstructured data has always been the barrier. You have medical bills, explanation of benefits, doctor's notes, all coming in dozens of types of formats, and so traditional automation just can't work here, and even first generation llms just weren't powerful enough. And so now, with these reasoning models being introduced over these past few months, it's now possible to build an authentic flow that can handle that dispute process from end to end with little to no coupons involved. And that's what we're building. We're deploying AI agents that can negotiate directly with providers and insurers. We launched our beta in March of 2025 currently working with 58 patients, we've already saved over $286,000 for patients. I want to put you in the shoes of one of our customers. Meet John. John was on the verge of declaring your bankruptcy just a few weeks ago before he met us in our Tiktok radio process where you paid and so he reached out. Don had a terrible accident last year, if he had to go to the hospital, transported by a helicopter, and got 13 different medical bills for over $274,000 we were able to automatically screen on for financial assistance, because he's unemployed, and most hospitals the United States are required to get financial assistance, which he didn't know about, and hospitals are incentivized to tell them about and in just six weeks, just last week, we got this letter from the hospital that his bill was crushed down to under $14,000

S Speaker 59:53Hi everybody. My name is Zoe Lynch, and I'm the founder of variant AI, the first mean game social platform. Who loves telling stories. I know I do. Actually, ever since I was a kid, I loved telling stories, whether it was the newest drama at school, done by parents, or it was like, what, I wish the ending of a fan fiction actually ended. It actually ended. Like pictures, they were really bad, or it was like me, like just talking to my day. I love to speak Okay, and I love to tell stories. But unfortunately for me, I couldn't do that. I had ADHD. I have a reading processing disorder, a writing one too, and I had a speech. So my words did not make sense at all. Not only do my words not make sense of my story too, and actually, for the longest time, most people didn't even really want to hear my stories. That's how we got to this. When I started playing Sims for the first time with my little sister, I remember I was clicking buttons, and on the screen I was doing a vampire romance Edward Cullen forever. Wells was like, I was like, doing there was a crossover. I was able, for the first time, I tell a story to my little sister, and for the first time ever. And I was, like, amazed. And I think I learned three things that day. One, I would never stopped playing The Sims. Two, I would continue to create games and communicate through games the rest of my life. And three, games are a powerful language. Games, I believe, are the next form of digital communication. If we look at social media, we have evolved from text image to videos and GIFs. And I believe the next step is something more immersive, something like interactive media. And that looks like video games. So this is us. So this is me and my founding engineer, Tony Sue. We're both geeks, AI masters and senior at Stanford University right now. I work for the Sims I've just done. I love research. He makes AI influencers, and we also both have a love for dating sims. So once I read a problem. Social feeds are passive. Game creation is painful. When we look at our feeds, the only interaction we can do is like in common when we look at games or slow to build. I know that for sure. And in regards to actually being seen and like visible, just if you want to tell your story so hard on clouds. So that's where Barrett AI comes in, a tweet, AD, joke, whatever it is, into a 62nd game. So whether you're RuPaul trying to like pub, like the next episode of drag race, to your like girlies, or your K Pop Stan who loves BTS and wants to live out your dating sim fantasies, or your beast game, Mr. Beast, trying to like, advertise your beast games, or you're kind of the cosmetics trying to do a really cool contest or a lipstick giveaway. Everybody can tell their story. So here it's clear that four mega markets converge, social, mobile gaming, UGC and short form. But honestly, beyond this, these are just numbers, right? This is about building a dream that I've had ever since I was a kid, and Tony, we're really excited to do all this. So yeah. So if you're excited to learn more about the future, enjoy the future games. Then please also reach out. So we had tried here. Thank you.

S Speaker 313:01Thank you. So up next we have David, who is bringing who is lowering the price of decarbonization for carbon and steel issues.
Thank you. So up next we have David, who is bringing who is lowering the price of decarbonization for carbon and steel issues.

Thank you. So up next we have David, who is bringing who is lowering the price of decarbonization for carbon and steel issues.
S Speaker 613:16Hello, everyone. I'm David Brown, co founder of helix carbon, where we are decarbonizing heavy industry by utilizing carbon dioxide. And we're starting with the iron industry, because iron emits over two gigatons of CO two every single year. And the reason why is because the furnaces that are in operation today are built on fossil fuels. They needed to create syngas, which is the key chemical reagent for turning that iron ore into iron that's ready for steel main and there's no way around this. There's no replacement, not at those furnaces that are operating today. That is the problem that helix carbon a serosal, we've developed a novel coal electrolysis system that can utilize carbon dioxide and water together in the same cell, and we can do it out of dilute waste streams, which means we can place our system on site at an iron furnace and take In all of those emissions in their entirety, no carbon capture required, and turn them directly back into that exact same fossil fuel sink gas that they're currently using today. This creates a carbon recycling loop that is a massive win for the steel maker, because they can access those green steel markets, and they can double their revenue and almost 10x their profits. We see this as a nearly $400 billion market and hardware sales alone. And we are well on our way. We've already we're raising a pre seed round right now to go from the lab scale to install our pilot by the end of the beginning of 2026 and after that, we're working on a phase scale up solution to enter the market prior to 2029 and we've got the right team to get this done. Crystal founder Gavin is not only a background in engineering MIT grad and a Yale grad. He doesn't run through my face, but he also worked with the Biden administration specifically on Iron and Steel decarbonization, they didn't have a solution, then they have one. Now I myself am a US Army veteran and former agile counter pilot, and I know what it takes to bring an operation from the beginning to the end. Our co founder, Ariel is an MIT professor and an experienced startup founder. We just hired our first employee, a PhD electrochemist out of Princeton. Our current pre seed raise, we've got about 10% close, and we're looking to close on the rest of it. We are helix carbon. Thank you so much for your time. Please follow up after you
Hello, everyone. I'm David Brown, co founder of helix carbon, where we are decarbonizing heavy industry by utilizing carbon dioxide. And we're starting with the iron industry, because iron emits over two gigatons of CO two every single year. And the reason why is because the furnaces that are in operation today are built on fossil fuels. They needed to create syngas, which is the key chemical reagent for turning that iron ore into iron that's ready for steel main and there's no way around this.

S Speaker 819:56Hi everybody. My name is Rowan, and we're building first Pan African repository of all case law and legislation. So one in four people is going to be African by 2050 that's part of the reason I spent my first law school summer clerking for the Chief Justice of the Rwandan Supreme Court, who gave me full access from the Supreme Court through the primary court to conduct interviews and identify potential intervention points for access to justice. It was there that I saw that it's hard to find, sort through and engage with law, both in Rwanda and across the African continent. The impact of this is significant. It's hard to access justice. People wait for years in prison because of delays. It's hard to do business, and it's hard to learn the best practices on the continent. And so in April, I went back to the Chief Justice. And I said, I know, if you compute computer engineers, I go to Stanford, you could probably put something together. By June, our team came together, and we had initial grants. By November, we had a prototype, and we had product market fit. The minute we showed we had to change passwords after each demo session because people would overwhelm our systems. They would take photos to use them later that day, and they said that we'd save about 70% of their workflow in April 1, I was introduced to a justice on the hanging Supreme Court who said that he wanted to make bringing this across African legacy. By April 18, they should showed it to 350 judges in Kenya. The support has been humbling. We set up a nonprofit to ensure access to our services could be delivered to people in the public interest, but we also realize that there's considerable economic opportunity here, because we're going to capture the entire African legal market. It is extraordinarily sticky as a product, and for our exclusive relationships with supreme courts, our unique access to data, some of which has never seen the light of day, the strong network effects between and across courts, and the fact that because judges are using the product, all the lawyers are also going to need to use the product, we believe that we've set a strong foundation. We also believe that we found a Trojan horse into unlocking economic potential on the African continent, and that is the fact that, again, one in every four people is going to be African by 2050 anybody who wants to engage with that market is going to need to be compliant with it. That information is fragmented and will be single holders of all of the case law and all of the legislation.

S Speaker 723:02great to see everyone. I'm nosa atomoya. I'm the founder and CEO of green Ford robotics, and we're building software for autonomous manufacturing with industrial robots. So right now, we're at a critical inflection point in our country. Everyone knows that global trade has shifted dramatically, and there's an emphasis on companies reshoring supply chains so that they can build what they need, but we don't have the labor to do it here. And fortunately for everyone in this room, AI and robotics is coming just at the right time. But the problem is, well, the opportunity really is to rebuild this manufacturing system with robotics and automation, and that's what reforge is doing. So the problem that we're solving is that robotics aren't currently accurate enough to do the highest value manufacturing task, and that's cutting metal. So metal is used cutting metal is used to make all kinds of engineered products, all kinds of things that you all use. And what we're doing is we are we have a proprietary robot control software that removes the vibrations that create inaccuracies in robot arms, so we can move, let's say 890, 8% of robot vibrations to make robots as accurate as these CNC machines. So what does that mean? That means that you can have now a robot that can do everything that the CNC machine can do, but not only that, it can do things that the CNC machine can't do. And so you can now start to automate a lot of things that you had to do in the manufacturing shop before with labor with the same robots. So to recap, our software unlocks high value manufacturing for industrial robots, which unlocks really high operational efficiency in factories, and so that means really happy customers that gets their get their parts on time and at competitive prices. So this is what the factory looks like. Now, with reforge robotics, most of these tasks can be automated by a robot, and the tax that that can't be automated. There's a lot of great companies already working on automation there. And so we are going to market by manufacturing parts in our low volume, low volume facility in San Leandro, California. So just right up the street, you can come and check us out. And we're manufacturing for on demand marketplaces like xometry, mfg.com, and the market's huge. We're starting here in the US, obviously, because there's a big need and but we envision a global supply chain that's built with reforge robotics factories. So in Michigan, you know, you'll have an autonomous vehicle factory that we're building, and then in LA and Houston, you probably have aerospace factories that we're building. So we're kind of becoming region specific and region focused. So this is a team that's building this company. So myself, I spent 10 years, the last 10 years, working on software that improves how hardware performs. And I met my co founder, also in my PhD program in Michigan. And we're currently executing customer pilots, and we love introductions to people in manufacturing and in robotics. And we are excited to rebuild the manufacturing, industrial manufacturing. It's ecosystem in the US. Come check me out in the booth later on. Thank you for your time.

S Speaker 1133:00Hi, my name is Adil. I'm founder of pocket data. So imagine that you're texting with your loved one and sending something like I miss you or Venmo in money to your friends, and notice that stranger is observing every word over your shoulder. So this violating of your privacy is happening every day for blinded, visually impaired people, millions of them, every day, just because they rely heavily on the voice comments and everyone around them they hear them. So the privacy is not just a convenience, it's your essential right of the every person. So what we have on market today it's a voice comment that everyone can hear them, traditional braille displays. It's hardware devices designed four years ago to use with the specifically with the computer, desktop computers and use in an office environment. It's a small pin that you go up and down, and usually people can read their fingers. And also there are big all key you cannot use them on go. The third option is keywords,
