S Speaker 11:51are becoming more and more important to us as well. But what it means, I mean, what we're trying so I'll tell you where we are in our AI journey. So what we do in Qualcomm is we pride ourselves in one metric across the company, which is performance robot. So we try to get provide the maximum performance for the lowest power so this applies to mobile phones. This applies to IoT devices. This applies to automotive devices, this applies to PCs. This applies to xr devices. This applies to a lot of different things. So we ship over a billion chips every year that go into all of these devices and and then. So what we're doing so, as you know, the word LLM or L, large generative models
are becoming more and more important to us as well. But what it means, I mean, what we're trying so I'll tell you where we are in our AI journey.

S Speaker 12:59were seeing most of these things run in the cloud, but what we're seeing now, you might be seeing as well, is that we're seeing enough number smaller. So there's two things that are happening. There's compute on devices that are getting that is just getting bigger and bigger and bigger. So there's compute and memory that is getting bigger and on devices. And then these, some of the models are that are smaller, have started showing really, really good problems there. So you can think how all the foundation model, the large foundation model companies in the world,
were seeing most of these things run in the cloud, but what we're seeing now, you might be seeing as well, is that we're seeing enough number smaller. So there's two things that are happening.

S Speaker 14:02and then. So where we are today in the journey of AI is making these models, making these models smaller, and making these models work on edge devices. And we're trying to figure out what sort of user experiences will work between all the large companies. So you can think of all the large companies that we work with. The one that you're wearing a t shirt of as well. And so, so we're all figuring out, what are the use cases, what are the experiences where on device AI will make sense, and then, and then, there's been a lot of discussion around what agent tic workflows will make sense. Because automation is, my opinion, automation is the name of the game

S Speaker 14:46and Agent tech workflows will be important. So, so really, what I want to do is also get an understanding from you on what you're saying, what you are developing, and then, you know, figure out how the teams can even start some conversations on
and Agent tech workflows will be important. So, so really, what I want to do is also get an understanding from you on what you're saying, what you are developing, and then, you know, figure out how the teams can even start some conversations on

S Speaker 26:07I think my team has, I even test them personally, but we've been testing a few, like, fine tunes of like llama 3.1 and they're, they're really like, it's impressive stuff. Let's just say, yeah, exactly

S Speaker 16:19so, yeah, we've been working very closely with meta as well and all that stuff. And so it is getting very, very interesting. So, yeah, good. I
so, yeah, we've been working very closely with meta as well and all that stuff. And so it is getting very, very interesting. So, yeah, good. I

S Speaker 27:45dashboard correctly. I can show you what the integration looks like actually. I can even just pull up so we have integration with Microsoft's autogen. So you basically install auto autogen with Agent ops, and then you basically just wrap your functions. And once you wrap these functions, basically all this data comes back into agent ops. So it's really, really easy to actually get going once you basically put in your agent ops API key, and that's all you have to do. So all you have to do is basically say what functions you want to wrap, and then you get basically this entire breakdown. We also have the same thing with career AI. So these are both, like, on their official docs, and this implementation, like, couldn't be easier to install Korea. You init agent ops and basically recording everything end to end. We also, if you go to, like, the blog with autogen, we just came out with, like, an interesting blog that your team might be interested in about, like, why agent observability is super necessary in the space, yeah, basically, within agentops, you get full breakdown of run environment variables. So if you're a big bank, or I feeling you guys are getting that for you want to understand who initiate the agent, what network they were on, what computer were they using, were they accessing it from, like public Wi Fi or to the company's VPN, we get all the data points. We're able to track LLM costs. We're able to see what errors and you know what's succeeding, what's failing, how many

S Speaker 19:01tokens are being used. So Adam, your customer is somebody who is developing agents with a combination of llms and does existing, are you also providing an agent automation workflow, like, like, you know how crew AI is, yeah, and is it? Do you provide tools similar to crew AI, or do you work with crew AI?

S Speaker 29:27Crew AI is our partner. So is auto Gen. So like, we integrate with Lang chain, we integrate with llama index. The way to think about is like, almost like a data store for all this type of data and debugging platform. I can kind of show you what this looks like. So you get a breakdown of, like, every LLM interact with investors and weights

S Speaker 212:43when we work with big like hedge funds, for example, they want to understand, they do research using these agents. So they'll be like, you know, this agent listened to a quarterly call. It transcribed the call, and then went to Bloomberg, S and P and Gartner and reference information from the call. And then it will come up with a list of questions for an analyst to ask during this quarterly call. When analysts are allowed to do so, they need to understand where the data is coming from, how it's being accessed, how it's being processed. What service are it on? Like they need to, like they do doesn't go and say, on February 6 at 4:12pm, what did our agent do in production? And that's the type of stuff that we've been really, really focused on in terms of painting this entire end time picture, whereas, like, there's other companies doing LLM observability, but that's just like a part of the like, that's like, maybe 10% of work we do is just on the LM side. We're really focused on that full intent spectrum.

S Speaker 113:36which is, so my question was more, which is, is, Are people mostly buying agent ops because they want compliance your question.
which is, so my question was more, which is, is, Are people mostly buying agent ops because they want compliance your question.

S Speaker 213:45So typically, what's crazy is actually engineers find us organically and start using us. So it's typically the engineer first who's like, starts using us. Sometimes they can start using us. Like we see massive enterprises using us for free initially, and then basically once we go and we upsell them, that's a process of like, okay, now we want our data more secure. And then there's usually a CIO or a head of innovation that we end up speaking to that's like, Oh, wow. This compliance piece is a great value add, but it really is an engineering first, like, product, where they're using us for, like, debugging. They're using us to, like, see different traces, see how long LLM calls are taken, to track everything, to compare different runs, to run evals. So this is, like, a piece that that's like, it's definitely engineering first, but compliance is usually like, like, almost icing on the cake once we've gone through the whole process.

Like we see massive enterprises using us for free initially, and then basically once we go and we upsell them, that's a process of like, okay, now we want our data more secure. And then there's usually a CIO or a head of innovation that we end up speaking to that's like, Oh, wow. This compliance piece is a great value add, but it really is an engineering first, like, product, where they're using us for, like, debugging. They're using us to, like, see different traces, see how long LLM calls are taken, to track everything, to compare different runs, to run evals. So this is, like, a piece that that's like, it's definitely engineering first, but compliance is usually like, like, almost icing on the cake once we've gone through the whole process.
S Speaker 114:37do you compete with Fiddler or something like Fiddler or Patronus.
do you compete with Fiddler or something like Fiddler or Patronus.
do you compete with Fiddler or something like Fiddler or Patronus.
do you compete with Fiddler or something like Fiddler or Patronus.
S Speaker 214:42We don't, like, honestly, the deals were entering, like, those are names that don't even come up. We've seen Patronus, I think they're working on some very interesting stuff. Fiddler is, I'm just making sure I'm thinking about them in the right way, the right fiddler.
We don't, like, honestly, the deals were entering, like, those are names that don't even come up. We've seen Patronus, I think they're working on some very interesting stuff. Fiddler is, I'm just making sure I'm thinking about them in the right way, the right fiddler.

S Speaker 214:57yeah. So they're very focused on LM, like, like, I said, like, it's just the LM observability. They're not looking at like, the other aspects that go into it. And like, when you think about agentic workflows, there's so many like, because I say the LM centers are, like, the best agents we see. Maybe LMS are 5% of the agent. So there's a lot that goes in behind the scenes surrounding, like, basically the tools being called, The being called, The database is being accessed, the websites being visited, the data is being pulled. So, like, that's kind of the way we think about it.
yeah. So they're very focused on LM, like, like, I said, like, it's just the LM observability. They're not looking at like, the other aspects that go into it.

So, like, that's kind of the way we think about it.
S Speaker 115:26That's good, yeah, I agree with you. Gente, workflows would be a lot more. And so how? I'm curious to you know, how do you use it? Because you've got this view of how people are using agents, and which types of industries have, you know, have agent tech workflows that are getting popular, and people are getting a lot of value out of those agent tech workflows. I'm curious to get your take on what are you seeing in the market? Which is, what's the most popular things?
That's good, yeah, I agree with you. Gente, workflows would be a lot more. And so how? I'm curious to you know, how do you use it?

S Speaker 216:01The biggest thing we're seeing right now is stuff that doesn't touch PII or production code is getting the most adoption. So think research is a great example. Before I got on this call, I had a research agent pull all the data on both of you, all my calls throughout the day. Before I go into them, I'm getting like, an email of like, here's who I'm meeting with. Here's the most recent podcast they were on. Here's the most recent news article about them, all this type of stuff. So from a research perspective, it's a huge opportunity for kind of anybody booking meetings to have, but also for financial analysis. So I can have agents that go out there in our 24/7 conducting in depth research on different companies, some different processes, different industries, coming back, consolidating that research and either creating reports or creating slack messages and notifying people about this research. This is such an easy agent to set up that has such a value add, because a human can't possibly extract like every data point that's on the internet, but in theory, an agent could. So that's like a really, really interesting use case we're seeing emerge quite a bit, sales and customer support of the other two that we've seen a lot of traction in. So for outbound sales, for drafting new outreach, this type of stuff, we're seeing a lot of opportunity there. Same thing with when it comes to when it comes to certain like, operational tasks, we're seeing, like, a lot. So like, here are access to all of our data stores. So like intern, snowflake, GCP, Azure, whatever you know you might have like, 15 different providers you pay for. And then there's some agents that are able to, like, go in and you can ask him queer questions from this production code, or from from all these databases. That's us picking up a lot of traction as well.

S Speaker 117:38And where do you is there, like, an agent database, which is, if I want that research agent, is there a marketplace where I can go get that research?

S Speaker 217:46Yeah, his name's Adam Silverman. You can, like, call him anytime, and I'm just, I'm just talking. You can, like, just ask me. Like, it's just, we've, I've built, like, gbts that can answer some of this stuff. The reality is, there's nothing better. Like, I've recorded videos and tried to train like agents and different like within it's like, there's a lot of stuff in my head in terms of, like, what works and what doesn't. I meet with these founders every day. These are friends. They're like, we were very in deep in the space, but we have, we are putting together, like, a more formalized marketplace. But I'll say it's still, it's never going to be complete, because there's always features that we know exist or still, like, in beta or something like that. Like, we get access to a lot of very early stuff, so we have, like, a good grasp on, like, what's possible, what's not. Does that make sense? Yeah, but

S Speaker 118:31we use some GPT SS on, you know, chat GPT as well, and, but, but like research on, on people, right? Which is, before this meeting, I want to know about Adam Silverman more than LinkedIn, and then do it such that it's a one minute. Yeah, we have these automations
we use some GPT SS on, you know, chat GPT as well, and, but, but like research on, on people, right? Which is, before this meeting, I want to know about Adam Silverman more than LinkedIn, and then do it such that it's a one minute. Yeah, we have these automations

S Speaker 218:58built out. So there's a bunch I can tell you, agents off the shelf that do this. That do this. I could, you could build agents that do this. You do this with Korea. You can do with autogen. You can use something like Mindy. You can use like, there's a lot of like off the shelf, off the
built out. So there's a bunch I can tell you, agents off the shelf that do this. That do this. I could, you could build agents that do this. You do this with Korea. You can do with autogen. You can use something like Mindy. You can use like, there's a lot of like off the shelf, off the

S Speaker 219:19right? Use Mindy here. I'll send you them.
S Speaker 119:24Are you familiar with Mindy creation? No, I'm not. Actually, we're

Are you familiar with Mindy creation? No, I'm not. Actually, we're
S Speaker 219:28good friends with them. If you want to contact your CEO. This is like, just one example. Like of them. The other one, I personally like this one's crazy. There's Omni this one, I answered my personal name into it, and it found articles about me that I didn't even know existed and like, so they're coming with an AP, yeah, it was, it's really, really impressive. I can just show you I can even like, I'm happy to kind of show you I have a staging account. He gave me access to so, So Brendan, I just did research on him, and it basically pulled me up every article about him, every data source you know, like you can go and find, you know, this is some I don't even know. Iowa State University from 2017 pitch competition. And I showed this Brennan last week. He's like, Dude, I didn't even know this article was posted. So that's like, this is the type of stuff that's really, really interesting. So like, I, I will say, like, there are going to be companies that exist that leverage this technology and are like, 3x more productive. Then there's many companies who don't, and they're like, you're not gonna like, it's like, writing it running a 10 second 100 meter sprint or a 32nd 100 meter sprint, where we're at, I think, I think,
good friends with them. If you want to contact your CEO. This is like, just one example. Like of them. The other one, I personally like this one's crazy.

S Speaker 120:44but the simplification of this, I mean, essentially, if you can empower more and more people with Agent workflows, is and then there's got to be a way for people to just go discover because there's so many People. The truth is, the unfortunate truth is, if even the agents that exist today, they get people, people are more, people are aware, or everybody is aware of it, there's a lot of jobs that would be at risk already because there's people that are doing manual task.

S Speaker 221:15Yes, in it, like, I'll tell you something. So I have an assistant. I gave her access to all the top agents I have, okay, some of these things are not, like, not even product like, they're not they're not publicly available. They're still in, like, alpha or beta. And she does a lot of data entry tasks for me, like scraping data finding, you know, data enrichment, this type of stuff. And she's like, can I please give these tools to my friends? My friends do these tasks every day, and I would love to give them these tools, because it will just change their life. And unfortunately, they're not publicly available. But you need to understand, like, be like my my assistant could be a chief of staff at a Series C Company tomorrow with the amount of resources she has. So that's kind of like, she's been upskilled. She has now access to an insane, like, toolkit, and it's only going to continue kind of improving in terms of, like, what she's capable of doing and what's possible

But you need to understand, like, be like my my assistant could be a chief of staff at a Series C Company tomorrow with the amount of resources she has. So that's kind of like, she's been upskilled. She has now access to an insane, like, toolkit, and it's only going to continue kind of improving in terms of, like, what she's capable of doing and what's possible
Yes, in it, like, I'll tell you something. So I have an assistant. I gave her access to all the top agents I have, okay, some of these things are not, like, not even product like, they're not they're not publicly available. They're still in, like, alpha or beta. And she does a lot of data entry tasks for me, like scraping data finding, you know, data enrichment, this type of stuff. And she's like, can I please give these tools to my friends? My friends do these tasks every day, and I would love to give them these tools, because it will just change their life. And unfortunately, they're not publicly available.

S Speaker 122:00with it, I think you need to start publishing like the agent of the week, like
with it, I think you need to start publishing like the agent of the week, like

with it, I think you need to start publishing like the agent of the week, like
S Speaker 222:06one agent I can send you. I don't know if you're on Twitter at all, but I do you. Do you post on Twitter every day? Yeah. So my co founder and I'll send you both our accounts in the chat here most days, but basically every week I do like, a weekly recap on, like, what happened in the Asian space. So this is, like, I was doing this for my own chat, but my co founder covers more like hackathons and more like people like Hackett agents. I'm more on the production side, but, yeah, follow us and like, you know, like, I'm happy to like, I'll tell you, there's, there's a lot of stuff going on, there's a lot of BS going on. So like, like, getting through all the weeds is kind of most important piece for us.
one agent I can send you. I don't know if you're on Twitter at all, but I do you. Do you post on Twitter every day? Yeah.

S Speaker 122:51Good. No, I'm, I want to make myself 10x so,
S Speaker 222:57okay, so you let me know this what I'll tell you, come up with a list of tasks you want to automate for yourself. Like, just like I the way I do is I have a notepad beside me, and I just take notes during my day. It's like, I did this task. I think this can be automated. Then I take it and make a Google doc of, like, if I've hired an intern tomorrow, what would I get them to do? Like, how would I automate this process? And then we can get going. Like, that's like, you like, either I'll take something off the shelf that works, or this how you build it yourself.
okay, so you let me know this what I'll tell you, come up with a list of tasks you want to automate for yourself. Like, just like I the way I do is I have a notepad beside me, and I just take notes during my day. It's like, I did this task. I think this can be automated.

Like, that's like, you like, either I'll take something off the shelf that works, or this how you build it yourself.
S Speaker 223:30but yeah, across, like, I'll tell you, like, I would like to one thing we do a lot of is, like, lunch and learns. So we'll go in and we, like, do this, like we just did with Bain Capital ventures last week. We do with like, McKinsey and some of these other firms where we just go in and, like, educate like, C suite or executive teams on like, Hey, this is like, what's out there and what's possible. So usually we'll send out, like, a questionnaire or something like that before like, hey, what tasks do you think you can automate, or what's the biggest need you think in the business? And we're happy to do this. And it's like, one of these things where, I think most people don't realize that there's actually stuff off the shelf today that works, and it's such a huge opportunity, like just basically bridging that gap and try and be like, Hey, this is what we can start doing tomorrow. You know,
but yeah, across, like, I'll tell you, like, I would like to one thing we do a lot of is, like, lunch and learns. So we'll go in and we, like, do this, like we just did with Bain Capital ventures last week.

You know,
S Speaker 124:08I let me think through. This might be an opportunity. Actually, we could do this. Maybe we start with our team
I let me think through. This might be an opportunity. Actually, we could do this. Maybe we start with our team
I let me think through. This might be an opportunity. Actually, we could do this. Maybe we start with our team
I let me think through. This might be an opportunity. Actually, we could do this. Maybe we start with our team
S Speaker 124:20you know, everybody in our team to list one task that they want to automate, and then create a list, send it over to you guys. You do that, and then maybe I do that for our C suite, like some of our CFO. He might be very excited to do this as well. And then that we're
you know, everybody in our team to list one task that they want to automate, and then create a list, send it over to you guys. You do that, and then maybe I do that for our C suite, like some of our CFO. He might be very excited to do this as well. And then that we're

S Speaker 224:35happy to have. I'll say a few things. It's like, we've tested everything we know it works. I'm very big on like, building systems that actually are going to be used. Like I, when we talk to like, the, you know, big consulting companies, they have done four, like, big consulting company can't say who did 400 Jenny I deployments this year, and they don't know how many are actually in production. They just know that, hey, we sent this to the client. We don't know if people are actually using it. And it drives me crazy. It's like, the amount of engineering hours of women's doing this stuff, and now these things I'll never see light a day is it's very frustrating for me, because I know how much time and how many engineers, like, spend, like, their nights building this stuff out, and they're not even out there in the wild. So we're really trying to bridge that gap. I'm really happy to figure out a way to work together. I'm like, can't be more upfront? Like, one thing I also, I think I mentioned before, it's like, you guys are ever doing agent deals or investing in agent companies? Just shoot me a quick note. Like, what do you think of so and so? And I'll be very blunt with you. Blunt with you in terms of like, like, hey, we know this is working. Or this is, like, there's something out here, because I've just seen a couple.
happy to have. I'll say a few things. It's like, we've tested everything we know it works. I'm very big on like, building systems that actually are going to be used.

S Speaker 125:33Yeah, I typically do that with a bunch of my founder friends, as well as WhatsApp them, what do you think? And then I only do it with people who are blunt.

S Speaker 126:10stuff. Adam, funding wise, where are you today?
S Speaker 226:14Yeah, I gotta jump in one minute. But we raised a precede in December. We've been pushing crazy hard ever since. So like, staying very lean. A lot of firms, I think I mentioned before, but like, are trying to preempt our next round. And I'm, like, I went to business school, I'm very methodical in terms of, like, where I want the business to be before we go out and raise, like, a, either seed or series, A, whatever we want to call it. So yeah, definitely, like, if anything speeds up on our side, I will let you know right away. Like, if there's any, like, we've had a few, like, even, like, like, bully term sheets come our way. Like, I'm just, I'm pushing it away right now, just because I want to make sure it's like, we are in a like, we're seeing the PMF. Like, I look at, I go and postdoc every day. I'm like, wow. But like, you know, there's issues in Russia and China and, like, Korea and all over the world, and it's, like, really impressive to me. But I do want to, like, discern revenue mark, because I want to hit before I go and raise a big
