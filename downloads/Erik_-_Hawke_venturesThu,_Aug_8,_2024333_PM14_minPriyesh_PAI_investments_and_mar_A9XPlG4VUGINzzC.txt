S Speaker 10:00Yeah, so Eric, I remember the last just to jog your mind, I think we met during John Tobias class at UCLA. I was a student at MBA then, and since then, graduated, joined the Qualcom ventures team. So thought I'd just catch up with you, probably explore a few synergies that we see currently with the AI world shifting and and maybe also your focus on the hawk venture side of things. Yes,

S Speaker 10:59do the thing. Yeah, sure. So, a brief intro on Qualcomm, and just, I think the team has been around for 26 years now, we have had more than 300 plus portfolio companies, one of the more reputed corporate venture capital funds, and a broad focus for us more recently has been on AI. As you can imagine, Qualcomm is in the hardware space, and we are trying to invest a lot in the software space. For AI we write checks across all stages, so we are very stage agnostic in that sense. More recently with the AI boom, we are trying to get into the earliest investing stages. So we do a lot of seed now, but we also write checks at A, B and C level. And I believe why I wanted to just catch up with you was that I have personally been seeing a lot of AI advancements and applications in the social media marketing, content management space. And I just wanted to see, how do you how are you seeing the entire world shifting. Are there exciting companies that or trends that you are following, or is there anything that we could possibly partner on?
do the thing. Yeah, sure.

S Speaker 22:08Sure. Yeah, so funny enough. We're doing it ourselves. What side check like, what size companies are you guys able to invest
Sure. Yeah, so funny enough. We're doing it ourselves. What side check like, what size companies are you guys able to invest

S Speaker 22:35yeah. I mean, you know, we're so the biggest they we started developing our own AI systems about eight years ago. So, you know, on the investment side, where how we're looking at AI is basically everything we work with needs to have some strategy around it, like we think of it more like the internet. It's like an installment came to me right now and said, I'm starting an internet company. You'd be like, cool. What does that mean? Like, I'm starting a company that leverages the internet to do this. That's how we're looking at AI, yeah, or this is how I'm going to have my company leverage AI, because if they're not, I feel like they're missing out on an opportunity we built. We started building our own systems eight years ago, knowing this whole AI thing was coming, right? And so we now are digesting 8000 companies, marketing, media and revenue data in real time. We're able to plug in, plug that into AI training in real time on what's going on in the market, so it can look at an individual company and actually optimize their marketing in real time. Yeah, and it's been basically automated marketing strategy, meet predictive analytics, and it's been super powerful. We actually came to market right before chatgpt, and now we're really it's really starting to hockey pick, and it's been something that's given us the differentiator at Hawk media, etc. So that's been our main focus on it. We've invested a couple tools. But honestly, if they have an AI in their name, or they're, like, trying to be an AI company, yeah, it's been tough,
yeah. I mean, you know, we're so the biggest they we started developing our own AI systems about eight years ago.

S Speaker 13:55get that, Eric, definitely. In fact, very recently, I came across one of your investments, and we were doing, we were due diligence in that it was recommended to us by the M 13 team itself, Aon. So particularly us as investors, we prefer to get into something which is very deep tech, and that's where we felt. While the team was great, Dan himself has built the entire thing, and he's great at selling. We wanted to wait a stage and then probably assess it. If there is, there has been more, I would say, tech mode, or GTM mode developed on the application. So it did not work out for us at this stage, but it was a pretty interesting company to look at.

S Speaker 15:06when you say that, you get into the weeds with them, do you actually get into the operational side of things? How? How deeply involved are you

S Speaker 25:13very like? So with that, that's where our strategic advantage comes in. So on our venture fund side, we'll invest in a company, and then the whole thesis behind it is that we have, we're currently like about 600 active clients at Hawk media. We can bring all those clients on board to these companies we're investing in and be a market maker for them. So for the diligence period, we have to make sure that we actually have buy in, and our team wants to use the software, and we have a strategy to onboard our clients onto it, because that's where we get Alta and outsize returns, is that we can actually bring the market to them and make it happen. It's what you know, it's what I feel like corporate ventures should be where it's like you can literally, if you're our partner or customer, we're going to be successful. That's what we are,
very like? So with that, that's where our strategic advantage comes in.

S Speaker 15:58right? Right? As Qualcomm, we try to do that with our hardware space. We try to provide the companies with the compute infrastructure. But I totally get what you're saying,
right? Right? As Qualcomm, we try to do that with our hardware space. We try to provide the companies with the compute infrastructure. But I totally get what you're saying,

right? Right? As Qualcomm, we try to do that with our hardware space. We try to provide the companies with the compute infrastructure. But I totally get what you're saying,
S Speaker 26:06but we're not that that's a cost saving or an operational efficient fee. That's not revenue we drive, right? Like, that's the that's the part that, like, if you guys use your whole Qualcomm network, that they were all going to become customers of your investments. That's where it comes in. Like anyone that shops with Qualcomm now have to use the software to that. That's the way that yeah, a win. Yeah, that. That
but we're not that that's a cost saving or an operational efficient fee. That's not revenue we drive, right?

S Speaker 27:48part that they're missing, because I've seen a lot of things that are starting to say that in terms of the social listening, is, why do like, what is it you have to have a really large pain point that it's solving for people to want to switch or adopt new software, and for that, it's like, it's some more insight, okay, but what do I do with that insight? What the action I can take, and is it real? Like, it's like, you it has to be impactful enough of a change to get someone to not just use Hootsuite, because that's what you're competing with. Like, that's, that's a tough business,
part that they're missing, because I've seen a lot of things that are starting to say that in terms of the social listening, is, why do like, what is it you have to have a really large pain point that it's solving for people to want to switch or adopt new software, and for that, it's like, it's some more insight, okay, but what do I do with that insight?

Like, that's, that's a tough business,
S Speaker 28:36that's exactly it. It's like, you know, and by the way, it might actually be that the insights allow you to make better decisions, but unless you can identify a pain point where people are like, I don't feel like I can make a good decision with the data I have like to make slightly better but the decisions are already good. That's not enough pain. You know, to be like, Oh, well, we're better than this other software that you are really happy with. That doesn't work. Yeah, right. It's got to be a, it's got to be a customer frustration that is being thought like, slightly more, especially in a market like now where nobody wants to onboard any more software. It's like, you got to have a software that's like, this is an issue for me and I need to solve it. Oh, thank god you exist, not we already. We know you kind of solved it, but we can do it better, like that's not a good story, and there's too much if you're talking about investing, there's way too much opportunity with people actually shifting the entire paradigm on solutions to invest in something that's kind of making it a little better. Incremental improvement is not a good investment, right now, right?
that's exactly it. It's like, you know, and by the way, it might actually be that the insights allow you to make better decisions, but unless you can identify a pain point where people are like, I don't feel like I can make a good decision with the data I have like to make slightly better but the decisions are already good.

S Speaker 19:38Their thesis, Eric, here, is that the entire influencer marketing space is very untapped, and a lot of these platforms, like brand watch sprout, they are not able to cater to the exact insights which come out of conversations. Have you come across platforms which actually do that? Yeah,
Their thesis, Eric, here, is that the entire influencer marketing space is very untapped, and a lot of these platforms, like brand watch sprout, they are not able to cater to the exact insights which come out of conversations. Have you come across platforms which actually do that? Yeah,

S Speaker 29:58by the way, that is 100% but that's a feature, not a company. Yeah, that's if I'm if I'm Sprout Social, or any of these others. I just feel like, okay, go plug in an LLM, with, start doing social with an egg that's going to be disrupted.
