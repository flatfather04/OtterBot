S Speaker 34:32Yeah, I was in semantic for a long time doing all kinds of security, product management, data data protection as well. We were there. We got onto, we picked up onto and PGP and VeriSign. So I've been in security for a long time. For a while, I was in the CNAP space working at lacework, and most recently, I was at Zscaler until like six weeks ago.

S Speaker 35:12I was actually competing in the same space as Zscaler, with Zscaler. Okay, you may have seen that they've been dabbling in AI products as well. So yes, of course, of course, new to witness, but I'm not new to the market. So, yeah, yeah,

S Speaker 25:31you probably end up witness works with Zscaler, right? It's like, it goes, Yeah, so I think, I mean, it explains a lot of you know, your background and the depth of understanding you have about the space. But I'll let Priyesh also introduce himself, and then maybe we can dig into some of the product, Dan, and we can run through slides. We can talk, we can keep it open ended however you want to. Or we can do a demo, quick demo, however you will. You prefer

S Speaker 15:59Priyesh? Yeah. Dan, pleasure meeting you. I'm Priyesh. I'm a Senior Associate here in the team. I work with Deepak on our DevOps AI infra investment focus areas, and then spend my early career working with a lot of different startups across different roles, and have been in venture for about three years now.

6:17Okay, great, great.
S Speaker 36:21So I mean, I can do this in whatever order you want. Do you want?

So I mean, I can do this in whatever order you want. Do you want?
S Speaker 26:26Where, what, maybe, maybe, how, how. How do you how do you maybe explain the product to an end customer, right? Like, what are the key value props? And then maybe, from there, we can talk about some of the features, and then go to the architecture that's enabling those features, right? Like, for example, how do you do, how do you do visibility of all API applications? And then there's an integration with Zscaler, some bit of network visibility. So maybe we'll start from the high level, like, what is the value prop for the customer? And then go into features and then architecture, and we can take it from there.

S Speaker 39:14Okay, sorry, I am back. It wouldn't let me change that permission without coming out and back in. I thought it all right. Can you see that?
Okay, sorry, I am back. It wouldn't let me change that permission without coming out and back in. I thought it all right. Can you see that?

9:26Yeah, yes, we can see so, um, so
Yeah, yes, we can see so, um, so
Yeah, yes, we can see so, um, so
Yeah, yes, we can see so, um, so
S Speaker 213:52so you're not getting top down, top down, pull right. So basically the CEO and the board, they are pulling this as, hey, I know AI is wild, wild west, and it's a lot of loopholes.
so you're not getting top down, top down, pull right. So basically the CEO and the board, they are pulling this as, hey, I know AI is wild, wild west, and it's a lot of loopholes.

S Speaker 314:07You want to go faster. We want to go in in the market. We know Right. Competitors are adopting AI faster than we are, and we're losing like they can if they have their developers, let's say coding with AI assistance, they can probably add three times more features per month to all of their Simpson services. So there's, there's really interesting business drivers, which are, again, it's like employee productivity move faster than the competition. Reduce the costs these things. Let's go so you know, it's the most top down pressure I've ever seen. Like boards are literally there was one. It was in NTT company going back and forth and redlining forever. Their legal department was just taking a long time in contracts phase board said, Stop it in the agreement.

S Speaker 215:05Okay, okay, that's great to know, because the product and pain point is resonating with the market, right? Because if there's a poll, firstly, it's hard to get CEO board level buyers to, you know, opine on anything like at Qualcomm, it'd be hard to do that. So I completely understand the nature of this. One question I have for you is, then, are they looking more for employee use are they looking more for jailbreaking or prompt injection or, like, where is the tip of this peer use case, or what's the
Okay, okay, that's great to know, because the product and pain point is resonating with the market, right?

S Speaker 315:41Yeah, it's a good question. So I'd say the market is shifting. So, you know, for the last year or so, it was predominantly the box on the left, yeah, and then, and they were thinking about the middle, but they weren't ready, and now, now this box is happening. So Toyota put out their first public facing LLM app last week, and that one Delta has one in beta. You know, NTT has like 10 of them that are all in beta. So this is all sort of just changing now, where companies actually need it, they all they always wanted it, they thought they just wanted it, and then the right one, agentic is the next big thing. And so I'm sure you've read all about it, but yeah, these AI agents are are coming in fast, but they're kind of in experiment land right now. So if, if you ask our big fortune 500 companies, most of them have like, a couple of dozen agents that they're prototyping with and exploring, but they think they'll grow to like 1000s in the spring. Yeah, in the spring, yeah, it depends on the company, but Schwab says April, they'll have 1000s.
Yeah, it's a good question. So I'd say the market is shifting.

S Speaker 217:08Wow, okay, no, because I the case, the case study, you mentioned your replication, deleting your file system, that was a pretty shocking incident, right, where it went on to delete the production database without, without giving any alert. And this was, this was during, during a blackout period, right?
Wow, okay, no, because I the case, the case study, you mentioned your replication, deleting your file system, that was a pretty shocking incident, right, where it went on to delete the production database without, without giving any alert.

And this was, this was during, during a blackout period, right?
S Speaker 317:27Yeah. The problem with, with the big security hole right now with agents is that they are taking on the identity of the of the person who's prompting it, right? So if, if you know, I use an agent, cloud, desktop agent, and ask it to do things, it logs into my browser and does them as if they're me, right? So anything that I can do, it can do. Coming soon, people are giving agents new identities, their own separate identities. And so it'll be, you know, you can, we'll be able to create different permissions and privileges based on that agents identity. But right now, they're just, you know, it's like you just have a little deputy that you assigned, and it does things on your behalf, right, right, right? So those are, those are the big waves.
Yeah. The problem with, with the big security hole right now with agents is that they are taking on the identity of the of the person who's prompting it, right?

Coming soon, people are giving agents new identities, their own separate identities. And so it'll be, you know, you can, we'll be able to create different permissions and privileges based on that agents identity. But right now, they're just, you know, it's like you just have a little deputy that you assigned, and it does things on your behalf, right, right, right? So those are, those are the big waves.

18:21Let me switch to
S Speaker 222:44Super interesting. And then maybe one question there is, when it comes to intent, would you also understand the employees background or the team's background or location or time, like, what? What are the nuances go into intent, right? Because I think, as you mentioned, that's one of the secret sauces, or one of the key, you know, attributes that differentiate you guys. What? What is the depth there you do also, like, let's say your marketing team asking a finance question is something that will be easily flagged. That's a very easy, simple classification. But I'm saying, do you get into the profile of employee, the designation of employee, the geography of employees,

25:27Very interesting.
S Speaker 325:28Read and protect. Like I said, this is, you know, we're shielding the models in the chat box that sells from different kinds of attacks, different vulnerabilities. That's what people are starting to use a lot now that they're actually rolling these services out, yeah, and then in the control we're basically enforcing policy across all of these things. And some of them are obviously security controls, like I said. Some of them are financial controls, though, which is one really interesting one right now. So you remember when cloud first popped up, and everyone said, Oh, it's going to be so amazing and cheap. And then people would get their Amazon bill and they're like, Oh, we spent $1,000 last month. Someone turned something on and never turned it off, right? Yeah, even more expensive, you know? Yeah, you can, you can burn those GPO tokens really quickly. And so right, right? We can monitor by, we can monitor the costs on these different things by, by user and group and so on. We can also save money. So let's say there's, like, a cheap way to do a certain kind of ask or using it on public cloud, like we can say, that's one. We're going to route that over from Cloud, over to this internal model that's much more affordable external use, like, I think I mentioned the Chatbot. I can go to Delta Airlines for witness chatbot and say, here's a super complex Python coding challenge. Please solve it for me, and it'll go earn $10,000 of GPUs and give me the answer. And so developers are like constantly farming which chat bots will handle hard coding challenges for me, and then because, then they can get it done for free, because they already used up their own monthly No, super

S Speaker 229:01You know that that is super interesting, Dan, because I think that piece right? You talked about 10 prompts, and now every employee will have, let's say, three agents, I'm just making numbers up, right? And they will run multiple prompts to do their own workflow, right? And I think, will there be a need for continuous monitoring of, you know, like this will become big, right, within an enterprise, like an entity, you're talking about 1.5 million prompts, it can easily grow to 10 million, 20 million prompts with agents being

S Speaker 333:33Okay, so, so because we can connect to Zscaler or Palo Alto or any other wall, or we have our own that gives us access to the raw data driving back and forth between all these AI services. And then we have this thing we call proto parser. Protocol parser is this real time engine that's taking all of those network packets at Cloud Scale and turning information that we can then, you know, do data detections, apply our guardrails, and then, even in real time, change the stream. So let's say, let's say, you know, you go to chat GPT, you try to attach a document. It goes up. It's with source code in it, we'll notice that the company has a policy that says, Don't do that. Well, instead of just blocking it silently, we'll write back as if it's coming from chat GPT, which says your organization's policy doesn't allow code to be sent to chat GPT, please call IT security if you think you have an exception. It's like that text we're injecting at the network level to get create better user experience, same way we were to redirect Right? Like, if you see a you sent this prompt and you're trying to send it in the cloud, right? You have a policy that says, no financial data going to cloud, please route it instead to this other thing. We're picking those bits off the wire and redirecting it and getting the answer back all silently, so you know the person doesn't or we can notify them, but, but those are all happening in the protocols of these native things.

S Speaker 236:02super interesting then, yeah, just one thought, sorry, you didn't mean to interrupt when you have these internal models, right? Of course, the models are non deterministic, right? They themselves might have some bit of leakage, or, you know, not, like, 100% accurate, right? What I'm trying to get to is, do you do, you know, cover that with some bit of rule based, very deterministic flows that you know for sure shouldn't break and should be 100% accurate?

S Speaker 336:45with accuracy, right? Yeah, we do both. You're absolutely right. We do both. So there are also rule sets and regular expressions, like, this is a credit card number I can tell determinist, or this is a social security number, or this is whatever. So there's it's a mix of both. And the good thing is, if you combine the accuracy of the two, you get lower false positives and higher accuracy, because AIs are good at certain kinds of classifications, and traditional rules are good at other kinds, and we find, found that a blend of those is, I agree, is the right approach.
