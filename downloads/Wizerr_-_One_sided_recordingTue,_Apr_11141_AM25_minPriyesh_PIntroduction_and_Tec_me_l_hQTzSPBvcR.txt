S Speaker 12:32GDC was good. We were looking at a lot of, I would say we, we've met a lot of infrastructure companies. We already have a few investments in that space. So not as exciting from that front, but met a few good companies late stage which were interesting. And then had four of our portfolio companies present there as well. So good to see them there as Yeah.

S Speaker 13:16I work at Qualcomm ventures as a Senior Associate in the AI investment team. And prior to that, I have been venture for about two years. Had a small stint with Menlo Ventures and morphs ventures in LA and then moved here, been with Paul compra a year the fund itself, we have been around for 26 years now, deployed more than $2 billion in capital. Currently have about 200 active portfolio companies across different regions. So we are in US, India, Israel, China, Latin America and Europe. In us. We aim to deploy about 150 $280 million a year, and particularly this year, I guess a lot of focus would be on AI applications.

S Speaker 14:03goes downstream from Qualcomm's play in the silicon layer. So not just, I would say, we started with mobile, and earlier years there were a lot of investments in mobile, but then we have expanded into PCs, into Cloud, inferencing chips, into a lot of IoT chips. And connectivity has been there for us for a long time. So any technology which streams downstream from that is somewhere we invest. So AI, the entire AI investment stack, I would say, we have investments in foundation model, in anthropic in the infrastructure layer, in hugging face scale, AI, weights and biases

S Speaker 14:42I would say, context, and a few upcoming stealth AI companies in the application layer, that's where we are focusing quite a lot. Other than that, have a lot of investments in computer vision, IoT, industrial automation, automobile tech stack, data center technologies, things like that. And then our check sizes would be anywhere from two to $15 million I think the sweet spot there would be five to seven. We are preferably a Series A Series B Company investor, but then we also invest in later stages, C and D, pre IPO as well. And opportunistically, we also do seed, wherein we write checks for $1.52 million but that's not really a strategy for us.

S Speaker 15:59right so we don't have A fund as per. We invest out of the balance sheet of Qualcomm. And hence we have different mandates for different regions in us. We have mandates of investing annually, 150 280 so that's what we're targeting. And from that perspective, we also don't have any restrictions on returning the returning the capital back to Qualcomm. So we are, for that matter, quite a long partner, quite Evergreen. Find it for

S Speaker 16:41absolutely so we what we look at is down the line. There is not a requirement for the company to be strategically relevant to Qualcomm today, but down the line, we want to see if there is a path on whether the company could either serve as a customer for Qualcomm. Can Qualcomm serve as a customer for company? Can we have an engineering partnership, a go to market partnership, or down the line, is it an m&a prospect for Qualcomm as well? So we evaluate a lot of those aspects. For that matter, given that we are very diversified across many more industries, and that's been a focus that spans quite a lot, but I would say here, it seems like Qualcomm would be a big customer for wiser. It's something that we could use internally, and that's where I think the strategic focus area would be for us. I

S Speaker 111:11interesting. So I would like to dig a little bit deeper into the, I would say, AI model that you have. But before that, are you connected with them. Already

S Speaker 111:26Interesting, interesting and correct. And you mentioned you have raised a pre seed round. How big was the round, and who were the investors there? Okay, and you're planning a seed round more recently, timelines on that and how big Do you expect the round to

S Speaker 111:54be? Yeah, got it. And traction wise. Avinash, where are you today? I guess, in a sense, you have a two sided marketplace. So on both of these sides, you have do you, how does your pricing models work? Do you charge the enterprises? Do you charge the designers? And What's attraction on both sides?
be? Yeah, got it. And traction wise. Avinash, where are you today? I guess, in a sense, you have a two sided marketplace. So on both of these sides, you have do you, how does your pricing models work? Do you charge the enterprises? Do you charge the designers? And What's attraction on both sides?

S Speaker 114:39got it, and I'm not How does it work? Like is visor really a gatekeeper? And can, I'm assuming you mentioned you were talking about you Oculus, but let's say, for example, let's use Oculus here. If Oculus wants to onboard a few components from different suppliers, are you acting as a gatekeeper, or are you open To all the suppliers out there in The world?
