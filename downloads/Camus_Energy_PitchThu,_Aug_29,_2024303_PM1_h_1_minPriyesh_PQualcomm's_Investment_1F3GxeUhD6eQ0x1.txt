S Speaker 19:33the slightly longer answer, the his essay, The Myth of Sisyphus. It's only about three pages. And his, his basically, kind of encapsulating that question of, like, how do you derive a sense of satisfaction in the face of a like, basically, like, in the face of the godless universe? And he's basically, like, you should imagine that satisfaction is all around you all the time. Okay, good. Thank you. Um, all right, so that's the context that we're working within a lovely lead in

S Speaker 124:31wasn't close to him. I know of him. He became, yeah, famously Rich, I guess, oh my gosh, what I wouldn't do with just two or three of his very expensive, rare Ferraris, yeah, exactly. I'm a car guy, but I'm like, the moment, so like, somehow, one day I stumbled across this guy. I'm like, fuck. I went to business school with him. I know, right. Yeah. Okay, cool. I switched over and went on to lead up software infrastructure development teams doing common software infrastructure for all of Google's major product lines. So the last thing I let up there was their microservices platform team, and we were building a basically refactoring a common, microservices based platform for all of Google's major product lines. And the last thing I did at Google was lead on migration to of all of Google's major products over to it. So, okay, cool. That was fun. And I was like, what if I started over from scratch in a different industry, but it has the advantage of being in a space that I think has a lot of upside. And I was really interested in transition my my career focus, to something that was climate facing. So I agree with your statement. Has a lot of upside, but I also it's almost like you're a masochist, because, you know, working with selling to utilities ain't gonna be fun, right? Yes and no. So from a purely commercial velocity perspective, it is a pain in the ass. I'm like, I'm not gonna lie, having said that, like this technology set is a really good fit for what utilities need in order to be able to kind of get where we're going. And because a lot of my role at Google in the early days was very operations focused, I took a lot of empathy for the people whose job it is to kind of keep things up and running and to be grumpy about technology adoption, but that's also because they get paged in the middle of the night if things break, and kind of an intern like, an internal bias towards really only adopting technologies if they're going To improve reliability profile, or, you know, otherwise, provide a real benefit to people. And that's something that, like, I really enjoyed about that work. And I actually really enjoy working with utilities because of that piece as well, like, at heart somewhere like that. You know, the part of me was carrying a pager is still alive and kicking. Okay, cool. I'm gonna kick over. I just gonna do a really quick demo for you. While I'm setting that up, maybe Raj could give you just like the super quick thumbnail of current customer traction. You wanna just kind of walk them through, like, current customers and stuff. Yeah, absolutely. We have 13 customers live today. Of those three are investor owned utilities. IOUs. We actually have quite significant penetration amongst the distribution cooperatives. Those are the rural nonprofit utilities, right? Sorry, so of the 13 three are what IOUs, investor owned utilities. Okay, so maybe taking a brief step back, there's roughly 3000 utilities in the US, and let's call it the top 200 or so are what are typically referred to as the IOUs being in Northern California, that means service by pg&e, Southern California means SoCal, Edison, San Diego Gas and Electric, Con Ed, etc, those types of entities of the world. The in there is also municipality owned utilities. Palo Alto is actually a very small Muni, but led WP Los Angeles Power and Light would be, it would be another one. Smog Sacramento Municipal Utility District is a municipally owned utility. And then there's the distribution cooperatives. These are nonprofits sponsored, originally by the federal government to Electrify America. The goal was really to bring electricity to rural parts of the country. And so they are member owned, community owned. So by being a customer of the utility, you actually vote on the board that mans that manages and runs that particular utility. Okay? So take giving that background for a second. We actually really love the distribution utilities, because their use cases are very straightforward. They care a lot about the cost of energy, meaning, as a nonprofit, they really care about the total pass through cost that is happening to their customers. The investor owned utilities, as you may be more familiar with, are highly motivated by capital investments, because they get a regulated rate of return based on those capital investments. And so the cost of good energy can in some ways be a pure pass through. And so it's a little bit harder at times to justify an investment in increasing efficiency when you are focused on building more grid, but when you are seeing 17 to 25% year over year rate increases like you are in California, and decreasing reliability simultaneously, people start pushing back on those rate increases. And so they really do have to start thinking about efficiency. Okay. Anyway, I feel like I've diverged slightly from the this is good. Appreciate the education, yes. So, so in a high level, I guess, what I'm hearing is that the the big names as we know them are are but a you know, from if there was a pie chart, right, there may be half of the utilities, or half of the energy that most there's about 3000 utilities in the United States. Of those, about the top 150 or so are the ones that most people have heard of. The top 150 or so serve actually about 70% of the country's population, but only about 50% of the land mass. In the co op category that Raj mentioned, which are the member owned nonprofits, there's about 900 ish of those, so there's actually quite a lot of them, and they cover a lot of the countries, like actual geographical like acreage and often notably, they're the utilities that are responsible for things like the land of ground, major heart highway corridors and stuff like that. So there's a few attributes of those that we really like about them. Points are similar to the to the investor own ones, um,

They're somewhat they're generally seeing, usually really regionalized load impacts. So there's a couple co ops that like, I know pretty well.

S Speaker 147:34There you go, 2.1 million in ARR today. Astrid, I owe you an update on this slide. By the way, we have 2.1 million in ARR today, we are targeting still 5 million in recurring revenue by the end of the year. We're fairly optimistic about that, in part due to some announcements of some group grants that are coming out. We also have one larger scale deal that's like, fairly far along where we did an initial engagement with utility that's hopefully due to transition into a longer term one. So that number is based on, like, work that's been applied for a while. Yeah, okay,
