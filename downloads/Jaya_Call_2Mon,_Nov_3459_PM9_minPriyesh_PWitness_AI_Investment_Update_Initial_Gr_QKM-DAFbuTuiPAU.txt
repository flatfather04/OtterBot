S Speaker 10:26How was your day? It was good. Yeah, we had, we usually have our I am meetings on Monday, so it was busy. But have some updates around witness. AI was like everybody else, as we have been thinking about this place, actually, like before I start one small type on the method I had sent you. The valuation for witness is not 200 it's roughly 300 but other than that, we had a discussion between witness versus activity in the team today. Mostly seems like the team is very much hinging on product maturity and the GDM that witness has been able to crack. They were even able to add a couple of good logos in the last few weeks. So seems like we are moving towards witness AI, like investing in witness AI, given we get allocation and everything, but that's, that's broadly, I think, where the team lies today. Usually, our seed stage muscle is also not very strong there, like we've been started doing seed in the last couple of years. We have done three seed rounds last week, last year, and just given that acuity is today, it's not as strong a fit for the mandates we have.

S Speaker 21:19Totally makes sense. Yeah, totally makes sense. No worries at all.

S Speaker 11:24Yes, I like to reach out to Satyam. I'll inform him on where we are in the process. We were transparent when we were talking to Sathyam. Just gave him a heads up that we're talking to other companies as well in the space.

S Speaker 11:36No, absolutely. This was such a good company. I mean, we have very actively reached out to as many companies as we can, and we spoke to roughly 20 odd companies in the space, and actually never showed up. Research that was so surprised that such a good company lies out there, and we were not able to find it. So thanks a lot for

S Speaker 11:54companies out there? So fitness seems very strong here. We've spoken to so many companies. I think the way I approach this was, I was really trying to evaluate the thesis of what, what sort of wedge could become, say, the enterprise level control team for deploying all AI. And I spoke to a few horizontal AI agent building companies, even our language frameworks like link chain language. I spoke some of them. Then I spoke to a couple of companies around application, vertical level application companies, which will become this for, say, some vertical industries. And lastly, when I was doing this entire research, one of the partners, new witness. So we spoke to them as well and figured out as well, and figured out, say, a network level company plus a model security company is probably the best wedge to win this market. And just by that filter, I was able to sort of say, move 15 companies out of that entire 20 company list that we had. And in this entire list, again, if I hadn't spoken to witness, I think acuity is probably the top out there in terms of just the foundation level things that they built on the that they built on their product, Bitna on top of what activity already has there. Witness has their own say, intent design studio kind of thing. So you can, as a specific enterprise in a specific vertical, go and fine tune the kind of intent you want to track out of your employees. Then you can build custom card rails on top of it. They have their own synthetic data generation in terms of the guardrails. Only needs a five or 10 thumbs up, thumbs down from an employee to really understand things are working. And then they have started building an on device agent. They've started building a browser based agent. So they are, just seems like point ahead in terms of product. The other companies, which I think are worth mentioning are Lanai and horoscape. Lanai is not taking a network approach, so I don't think it will be available in this space some for some enterprises, I think they have a strong endpoint security software on the laptop, so people cannot really install any AI application, and most of the traffic goes through browser. And I think this is the market that Lani is targeting. It's an easy product, easy when for a good part of the market, but it will not be as comprehensive, say, as an activity or fitness. Similarly, for or escape, they haven't gained a product yet. They're still building a product. It would be very similar to acuity when they launch. But then activity seems much further up ahead against all of these other players, witness, I think probably Ashu flag, Rick is a very strong salesperson, and then just a ballistic packing is probably getting them a lot of early wins. But back on the back of this packing, they have a very strong pipeline, and some of their deployments are so large, like Entity Data, I saw, activity has one of NTD data. Activity has it as one of the channel partners, Entity Data is witnesses customer, and they have 1.5 with entity, and the other contracts that they are signing are not as big, but in the same range. So these guys seem to have cracked the GT Well, their systems are also running at very, very large scale. So entity has 160 K employees covered across witness. The other customers also have roughly 30,000 40,000 kind of employees that are covered in there. The deployments look really strong. It looks like the product is enterprise ready and at the same time. But I must say, activity has a much stronger energic security product. Witness is developing something like that. They aren't there yet. They want to launch it in queue one. But activity seems to already have that. That's a very strong product. But we were tracking this entire market more from a shadow AI detection space, and that's where I think witness has has an advantage. Has an advantage.

S Speaker 14:47customers and stuff too? Like, give any sense? Yeah. So say they have, they have some really large logo. They have entity in there. They have delta. They have data airlines. They have charge swap, roughly all of these range between 500 to seven to 800k handle contracts. I. Wow, yeah,

5:01that's all on the space.
that's all on the space.
that's all on the space.
that's all on the space.
S Speaker 15:02I don't think so, right, that it wasn't normally like all of the companies which would do both shadow ai plus agent security in these spaces, fitness is at 4 million, roughly, error. Every other company is at the same level of activity plus, but with less mature product. For sure, the companies which are just in the model security space, they like, I have come across one or two contracts which are, say, roughly 350 400k size, but none are of the scale of fitness, which was really interesting for us. I should say, I wonder if it's like holistic, driven. It could be, it could be the early winners could be ballistic driven. Witness, also, one thing that they've done is they've worked very closely with their customers. So the five enterprise logos that they have today, and couple of couple more that they signed were very recently, but the early fives. All of them are in a customer discovery panel with witness. So they meet regularly every week. They're working very close with fitness as design partners. And these are some very large customers, right? These are the likes of Entity Data, Data, or Delta Airlines, charge shop. So it's it's pretty interesting to see how brick has been able to sort of put everything together, and the product works well. So I get a shoes point of the team not being very strong, and that was one of our concerns. We really dug really deep into product architecture, tech stack and all those things. Basically, yes, the team does not seem very strong, but they have somehow been able to build this product, product product muscle, for sure, and they have a very large sales team as well. So that would probably also mean how the production is coming.

S Speaker 16:25We appreciate that absolutely, absolutely makes sense for activity. I just think the market is getting there even Qualcomm. And I consider Qualcomm as a very, I would say laggard in terms of adopting anything around AI. But even Qualcomm has started doing some of these discussions on whether do we need to replace our browser based website filtering system with a more AI native system? Some of these larger enterprises are really moving here. I see activity has a very strong pipeline, but maybe they should prioritize some of these larger players with witness when I was doing some of the customer calls, it felt like some of these players did not really know of the other companies out there in the market, and there are a few, but it's a very open market right now, and maybe a larger race at this point for activity and doubling down on the sales team may make sense be very overload of thoughts.
