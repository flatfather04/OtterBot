============================================================

S Speaker 10:40I wanted to continue on that direction, just packing the roadmap a little bit better, and the sales motion along with it, just understanding, and this is this goes back to far where we were talking about who the buyer profile is, what the ICP is, and and how do you expand from there, right? So it's, of course, number of seats, or the coverage expansion. And then beyond that, what do you add on top of it? There was one piece. The second piece I wanted to understand was the agent observability stack, which for me is it could be like, you know, it could play out next year. For me, that's, that's the big optionality that is baked into the model. We haven't had a chance to dig into the model yet, but some, if you can tie it, tie the story into what's driving growth in the next two, three years. And yeah, that's effectively what we'll be underwriting, right? So we are underwriting next two, three years of growth, and when you fundraise next, yeah.

And there's also, there is also evals, right? So you also, like, I will
S Speaker 25:10put all of them in the dev side, yeah, Dev side of the bucket. So if you look at the dev side of the bucket, what developers care about is, you know, evals, yeah, traces and span, you know, kind of debugging all of that, like monitoring experiences. And if you look at like the enterprise side, they care more. They care about security guardrails.

S Speaker 15:32enterprise doesn't care. So you're basically at the intersection, right? So if I look at the enterprise as the horizontal, right? And you know, there are these development teams, you go deep into the development teams to give them, you know, the nuts and bolts of traceability, right? And then for the enterprise, you solve for some bit of governance, some bit of guardrails, but for that right? But for that application,
enterprise doesn't care. So you're basically at the intersection, right? So if I look at the enterprise as the horizontal, right?

S Speaker 25:52correct? Correct for that application. That's why we are able to command higher ACVs, right? So, you know, you might like many of them. You could say, Okay, I'm a developer. I can use Lang fuse or whatever, or whatever is out there. That's open source, but it's not going to scale for your enterprise. It's going to scale from a team perspective. So that is the big opportunity that we have, and a lot of the work that we have done with this in house guardrails in house evaluator models, you know, the infrastructure running on your premises in a scalable manner, integrations with these third party AI applications that I think being able to do both of these things is something that is that's working out well for us. It matches with our GTM motion, you know, sort of everything. All of the story fits in.

S Speaker 16:36Got it, got it, got it. And do you integrate with any of these gateways or proxies.
Got it, got it, got it. And do you integrate with any of these gateways or proxies.
Got it, got it, got it. And do you integrate with any of these gateways or proxies.
Got it, got it, got it. And do you integrate with any of these gateways or proxies.
S Speaker 26:44Yeah. So like we have integration with light LLM in Nemo guard rails, you know, Port key, you know, many of these open source ones, and whatever customer is building. You know, the customer may rule their own thing in the future. As we do this thing, the control plane vision also has some gateway components. We may be building our own intelligent gateway. Maybe we'll just package light or service around them and just like, it's out of the box for you, versus
Yeah. So like we have integration with light LLM in Nemo guard rails, you know, Port key, you know, many of these open source ones, and whatever customer is building.

S Speaker 17:09like, because I think one of the use cases we also have is, and I'm just putting it out there, right, which is, let's say, if there's a query from a developer or user of a chatbot, right? And instead of sending it to the cloud, we have an open source model that's deployed that's cheaper, right? So rerouting the query based on, you know, what information is asking and how much cost will that query take, we can reroute the model as well, right? Is that capability something that you guys can handle right now? Yeah.
like, because I think one of the use cases we also have is, and I'm just putting it out there, right, which is, let's say, if there's a query from a developer or user of a chatbot, right?

S Speaker 27:41So like, right now, if, if you are building right now, because we don't have a gateway solution within, we will partner with somebody to partner. Will build sort of saying, like, for example, ADP is a customer, right? So they are, they're becoming a customer. They actually have done us very successful. POC, they've implemented their own custom gateway internally, and we are integrating at that level to provide them with real time guardrails and observability, right? So I think, I think many of the customers recently, I was speaking like father and I were at the CIO event, and one of the feedbacks that we got from one of the CIO customers is, look, if you package a gateway along with what you're already giving, just much easier for us, right? So I think it's so that's definitely, you know, aligned with our roadmap thinking, you know. So, yeah, I think in the future you would see, you know, like Fiddler coming with its own intelligent gateway, and you don't have to do it as an enterprise customer.
So like, right now, if, if you are building right now, because we don't have a gateway solution within, we will partner with somebody to partner.

S Speaker 18:33You don't have to do it as an enterprise. Got it, got it. And maybe on the agent side. Do you have any more details on, let's say, a customer building, and what, where did you integrate, and how do you expand

8:46it? So more, yeah,
S Speaker 28:47so, as I said, in the dev world, of people are building agents. You know, they have many different agenting frameworks. You know, there's like, strands, like some of the AWS customers use it. There's gcdk, like, what Coinbase told us. We heard it from HCA healthcare and a few other healthcare customers using GCP ADK, there's, of course, land graph, you know, you know D spy score is using D spy, you know, many, few, many people use land graph. And so there's a variety of these orchestration frameworks. First three frameworks that we prioritized are, you know, AWS, trans, GCP, ADK and land graph, right? So those are the integrations that we have today. So if you're a developer building agents on this framework, online integration with and you get all the logs to fit, are you

S Speaker 29:38so with AWS and GCP, we are in their marketplaces, and we have like, you know, sort of working on this CO marketing activities with them to publish these blogs. We just recorded a podcast with an AWS strands DevRel person or Fiddler can work with strands, you know, we're going to do this with, like, in other teams as well, GCP and the line graph teams. So that's on the dev centric side. On the enterprise centric side, we have integrations with glean, MS, copilot, SAP jewel. These are all third party agents, you know, agent for Sierra today. And so those are some of the most common agents that we are seeing. And then, and then, as we sort of, you know, get more like, you know, more exposure to more agents. We keep building integrations with those things so that we become the third party observability for these agents.

S Speaker 110:29Got it, got it. So I think, depending on the framework you will be getting, you know, the depth of observability will vary, or what data you get from different agents, it vary. And same with third party apps, right? It's like, everybody's building agents differently. So is there a, like, common, common denominator, where you're like, hey, we can do this thing very well, right? Irrespective of agents or integrations or stuff like that. Yeah.
Got it, got it. So I think, depending on the framework you will be getting, you know, the depth of observability will vary, or what data you get from different agents, it vary.

S Speaker 210:56So, so one nice thing is, a lot of them are following OTEL, right? And, you know, and there's that sort of at least, I mean, we initially started building log collectors, each differently for each of these frameworks. And then once everyone started adopting hotel, we just went towards this universal law collector. Now, even with that, there is, of course, like, you know, land graph will, you know, has some new concepts like fusion IDs and things like that. Some of them may not have those things, right? So, so there's like a, you know, we provide, like, a least common denominator of like, you know, whatever you know, everyone can send, you know, basic at the basic level, the spans, you know, inputs and outputs of each of the spams, and then being able to then track using a trace ID, you know, track sessions and being able to aggregate at those levels more information that we get from, you know, different agent players, and we can, we should be able to do roll up statistics around those those IDs, right? So that is the approach that we are taking. Yeah, I think eventually it should become a lot of this should get standardized, and already everyone is adopting a hotel and MCP, and hopefully the logs themselves will become like, what that the transmission will also be.

And, you know, and there's that sort of at least, I mean, we initially started building log collectors, each differently for each of these frameworks. And then once everyone started adopting hotel, we just went towards this universal law collector. Now, even with that, there is, of course, like, you know, land graph will, you know, has some new concepts like fusion IDs and things like that. Some of them may not have those things, right? So, so there's like a, you know, we provide, like, a least common denominator of like, you know, whatever you know, everyone can send, you know, basic at the basic level, the spans, you know, inputs and outputs of each of the spams, and then being able to then track using a trace ID, you know, track sessions and being able to aggregate at those levels more information that we get from, you know, different agent players, and we can, we should be able to do roll up statistics around those those IDs, right? So that is the approach that we are taking. Yeah, I think eventually it should become a lot of this should get standardized, and already everyone is adopting a hotel and MCP, and hopefully the logs themselves will become like, what that the transmission will also be.

S Speaker 212:12level, and that that also becomes a strength in for a third party, because now we, as we if we build these integrations, then the customer don't have to do it right, like, you know, like, let's say Coinbase, for example.

S Speaker 112:38And, and this might be a different question, but maybe underlying architecture of your platform. But do you have any in house models that you've built? Right for could be generating guardrails or detecting, you know, policy intent or you know, or doing evals, any internal models that you built?

S Speaker 213:01Yeah, so for that is, the big strength of Fiddler is the inline evaluators that run very fast, like we call them trust models, right? We have built in house some of that. We have taken open source, you know, llama Mistral, Nemo Tron from Nvidia, and GP two OSs and sort of prompt engineered them, and we built an entire runtime infrastructure, you know, to host them right, so that the models is one piece of it, but being able to host and run them and deploy them and do upgrades to them, and doing it on a customer's environment, that's a significant piece of engineering. Their entire company is doing it right? Like together of the world, the entire business is built around it, you actually are doing it only for evaluation of inference.

S Speaker 113:47That's what I wanted to ask. So I know you guys do your trust models, but for which different aspects of the tool right? Because you can use it for guardrails. You can use it for policy enforcement. You can what, what is it? You use it for everything. We use the

S Speaker 213:59evaluation, the trust models for offline evaluations for online we call the online ones for guardrails or real time observability, but they are fast. You know, we can, you can use it, right? Of course, there's latency differences between, like, if you have a very small bird scale model, then like 101 50 milliseconds. But if you go to a little bit larger, like Amma or GPT versus the new fail, anybody? Latency costs, but you get more accuracy gains. But we also support completely third party LLM as a judge. So if the customer says, look, okay, you know, I for this type of task, which is very advanced reasoning, I trust, you know, Azure, you know, open, AI, or whatever that is, and we can just send that traffic to Azure, open AI. So right, right. So the inferencing system is flexible. You can control, you can sort of configure or what you want to use.

S Speaker 114:54got it? Got it? No, because I was trying to think like it's effectively the way evals will be done is you'll have some certain database of tests that you run, right? And you can, you can create more tests based on, you know, some,

right? That is a layer on top of it, right? Yeah.
right? That is a layer on top of it, right? Yeah.
S Speaker 215:18so the architecture sort of flows like this, right? So you have your apps, your model providers, your data lakes, where all the data exists, you know, sometimes we are just getting real time, you know, logs from the agentic workflows themselves, you know, sometimes, you know, we are, you know, getting, like, the logs from, you know, different model providers, or like, you know, you know, cloud CSPs, or like, they're all logging to a data lake. And then we sort of receive these logs. We ingest them. The logs themselves may have prompts responses, and then we and then we sort of store them in our clickhouse database, which is, you know, meant, you know, we fine tune it for very high cardinality, you know, type of ingestion, and, you know, aggregating statistics, and all of this can run in an air gapped and VPC environment. And then we have this GPU, or, you know, orchestrator system, which basically runs these evaluator models. We invested a lot on racer, and we run these evaluator models. Right now, what you do is, on top of these evaluators, you can define the custom metrics. So this is where you, you as a developer might say, Yeah, say I am building, let's take that Coinbase example. Let's I'm building, like unit testing for my application, right? And now I want to define evals around it so I can write like, custom evals as, like, you know, business logic definition that that that get registered as metrics, you know, from a monitoring perspective,

S Speaker 116:45like basically custom emails, right? Yeah, so, and because the world is moving towards there nothing is like a cookie cutter works out a box,
like basically custom emails, right? Yeah, so, and because the world is moving towards there nothing is like a cookie cutter works out a box,
like basically custom emails, right? Yeah, so, and because the world is moving towards there nothing is like a cookie cutter works out a box,
like basically custom emails, right? Yeah, so, and because the world is moving towards there nothing is like a cookie cutter works out a box,
S Speaker 216:52right? And you would write them in your Python, Python Twitter service, yeah, declare them in Python, and that's what, that's what sort of, you know, gets like, tracked as a metric and and then you can also define your policy like, especially around guardrails, you know, if you want to not like show certain things or should not avoid some keywords, those things can, can, kind of can be defined as a policy control plane, all of the inventory and, you know, you know, sort of just like all the user experience around metrics and scores and reporting and all of that will sort of stay the same, so, but that's basically how it, like, sort of works, you know, from a, you know, from a product perspective, yeah. So, so, so, yeah. So, essentially, the the custom evals is definitely a part

S Speaker 218:50Yeah, so, so let's talk about agent force like, you know, we've done this integration with lender homes, one of our you know, customers. So what done is they're using agent force, and the agent force logs are stored in Salesforce cloud, right? So that becomes one of the data links here, and we say, okay, they're stored in hotel format. So we can go and grab those logs, Agent force and the rest of the process, sort of, you know, basically, is the same thing.

Sorry, I didn't mean to probe in the sense. I was just trying to understand how much
S Speaker 220:03you have. That's a fair question. So in line, integration will only happen if there is a gateway level, you know, if there's a gateway level access control that the customer already has. That's why, for us, it's important to invest in that intelligent gateway so that we can enforce those things. You know,
you have. That's a fair question. So in line, integration will only happen if there is a gateway level, you know, if there's a gateway level access control that the customer already has.

S Speaker 120:19you get. Why I'm asking. It's not just about the product question, but because it opens up a new, newer market, because, like, 20% of AI development, there's a lot of 80% of third party apps that people right? So that's, that's the opportunity. So maybe we can

S Speaker 220:36select that is why this roadmap right now we have observability card race evaluation, right? You have to build these tool gateways, these model gateways, these things that are sort of part of this roadmap, right? This is the vision. This is why we move from observability, right,

22:05Let's make it a conversation.
Let's make it a conversation.

Let's make it a conversation.
S Speaker 122:07I'm not trying to interrupt, yeah. What I was curious about was, how, what will it take for it to become a market beyond regulatory industries, right? So I'm saying that the market exists, and today, the need for something like this is more evident within regulated industries, because if something breaks, the liability is too much, right? They have to be careful. Are you seeing like a consumer company, right? You know, building their own internal application and thinking about, hey, we actually need to secure a lot of these things, right? And have policy guardrails. Are you seeing that play out already? Yeah.

S Speaker 322:46I mean, I mean, if you look at the example that Krishna gave earlier about Coinbase, right? I mean, Coinbase, I would say, is a consumer. I would
I mean, I mean, if you look at the example that Krishna gave earlier about Coinbase, right? I mean, Coinbase, I would say, is a consumer. I would
I mean, I mean, if you look at the example that Krishna gave earlier about Coinbase, right? I mean, Coinbase, I would say, is a consumer. I would
I mean, I mean, if you look at the example that Krishna gave earlier about Coinbase, right? I mean, Coinbase, I would say, is a consumer. I would
S Speaker 122:54still say regulated, because it's financial services, sure, I know you put what I'm trying to say is
still say regulated, because it's financial services, sure, I know you put what I'm trying to say is

S Speaker 323:01maybe quantrix is another good example, right? So Qualtrics enterprise, it's, you know, they're more on this, on the smaller size company, right? You know, 453, 1000, 4000 employees, right? So with them, you know, we just, we are, we just finished a few POV with them, right? It was like technical when we had an executive alignment call with them, Krishna and I did with their CEO and president everybody else a couple of days ago, and they are all in, right? I mean, they're going all in on the on the agentic side, you know, Gen AI observability, right? I mean, they're going in, going all in, right? So they are absolutely, they're doing very deep, you know, they did a very deep POV with us, and, and so, you know, and they have different use cases, right? So their use cases are both internal applications as well as customer facing, asset facing, right? They're, they're doing, you know, they're selling to CMOS, they're selling to go to market organizations, right? You know, selling them data analytics and all those sorts of things and so, and that's right for AI disruption. So they're using us. So these applications that they're going to use us for are both internal and external applications, right? So that's a good example. So and as we speak, you know, like I said, I mean, I think I told you this last time, because we have like, seven, eight POVs going on with Qualtrics, with United Wholesale mortgage, right, financial services as well, but smaller, ish, United Wholesale mortgage, with ADP, with Ericsson and, you know, so on and so forth. Every single one of them is agentic. Agents first POVs. Every single, every single one of them, right, including politics, right? But they're, they're, every single one of them is an agentic first POV and then by the day they, you know, they all have big plans. Obviously, they're still early on. That's why, obviously that, you know they're bringing us in, but you know, they're all early on in their journey, and they as they and the way that our priyeshy model also works, as you know, we charge by the number of models or applications by data ingested, and then we also can sell like different SKUs. So every single customer is a land and expand customer. We, you know, as they grow, because of our pricing model and how it works, we will naturally grow with that. And that's the other thing we're seeing this year, is that the expansions are also happening at a faster clip, right? For example, elevance health, which came on board as a customer a few months ago, they already expanded. Within three months, they already expanded with our guardrail solution. And now we have three other opportunities in the pipeline with them to do you know, more expansion and different divisions of elevance, right? And so these are all you know, Gen AI agentic, first type of opportunities that we have in the pipeline right now. And that is the big shift we've seen right of a year ago, our pipeline was very heavy, ml focused. But you know, you know what's happening in the genetic world, that pipeline has shifted dramatically, where 95 98% of our pipeline right now, Gen AI first pipeline
maybe quantrix is another good example, right? So Qualtrics enterprise, it's, you know, they're more on this, on the smaller size company, right? You know, 453, 1000, 4000 employees, right?

S Speaker 126:26is this coming through firstly, that's tremendous transformation from ml only. And I see that in your interaction as well. You know you have equal, if not more, revenues coming from this newer product portfolio, right? Which is, which is tremendous. What I was trying to understand was the agent side of things, where is it more involved? Is it more partner driven, or is more experimental today? Like, hey, we don't know what we don't know, and we want some tool to like both right? Majority, it's a bit of everything, and majority of God of Krishna, right? So I'm saying that, like, right now, like, I'm coming in with a bet
is this coming through firstly, that's tremendous transformation from ml only. And I see that in your interaction as well.

So I'm saying that, like, right now, like, I'm coming in with a bet
S Speaker 227:07that most people are building singleton agents. Like, to be honest with you, yeah, nobody's doing autonomous, exactly. Most people are, like, these are human in the loop, you know. Sort of think about them as, you know, rag v2 you know, like, and I think, you know, I think as they mature, as they become more confident, as they learn this space, more they'll start like, building more and more complex agentic workflow. So, right? So I think, you know, like most people, have three, 4/3, party tools, right? So it's not 3040, yet, you know, to where the CISO is worried so, but it's happening soon. So we were talking to the CI of amplitude conference, and he said, look like I have 4/3 party tools, but I'm worried within six months it's going to be 40. Yeah, because I just don't know what are my different teams in my company are talking to, you know, different third party agent decaps and trying to bring them into the fold.
that most people are building singleton agents. Like, to be honest with you, yeah, nobody's doing autonomous, exactly. Most people are, like, these are human in the loop, you know. Sort of think about them as, you know, rag v2 you know, like, and I think, you know, I think as they mature, as they become more confident, as they learn this space, more they'll start like, building more and more complex agentic workflow.

S Speaker 128:03And 4040, for a company like amplitude, there's a lot of tools, a lot of tools. It's like, not that with the company, right?
And 4040, for a company like amplitude, there's a lot of tools, a lot of tools. It's like, not that with the company, right?

And 4040, for a company like amplitude, there's a lot of tools, a lot of tools. It's like, not that with the company, right?
S Speaker 228:08And so, so that is the that is the worrying sign for all these folks, right? The pace at which it is going. So, yeah, today, in point of time, you may have a handful of homegrown agents, a handful of third party tools that you have to support, I see. But the thing the market is coming like the demand is coming very, very shortly, and that's why they're trying to prepare for this.
And so, so that is the that is the worrying sign for all these folks, right? The pace at which it is going.

And my second question to is it inbound or channel driven or director? How is it
And my second question to is it inbound or channel driven or director? How is it
S Speaker 228:33all of it like, for example, recently we got like, the CIO of NRG, like big energy company, out to us, out of the

blue, agents on, yeah, like,
blue, agents on, yeah, like,
blue, agents on, yeah, like,
S Speaker 328:44yeah, it's absolutely across the board, right? So we're seeing inbounds come in. I mean, just yesterday, you know, so we had, we just released our, you know, we did this marketing campaign around healthcare, right? Really nice. You should take a look at it. The, you know, head of AI Kaiser signed up for it right away. And, you know, so those types of opportunities are coming in, right? So we get inbound, we also get partner driven opportunities. For example, Qualtrics, because we have this tight partnership with AWS. They held our hand, walked us in there. There's a couple other mass mutual there's another one again, the Heller hand walked us in there. And then others are, you know, we do, you know, a lot of different marketing programs, everything from events and webinars and white papers and, you know, just sem SEO field, I mean, all sorts of field events. And so through those, then we get, obviously, you know, a lot of those types of things, right, for example, like even last week, last weekend. Oh no, it was this week. Has been a long week. So this week, Krishna and I went to, you know, a couple of CIO events, right, that were very niche, just, you know, very small. And then next week, I'm in New York for a couple of events there. And so, you know, you know, we do a lot of those where we can get, you know, you know, one on one type of meetings with the CIOs and head of AI. So we're recapping multiple white men,
yeah, it's absolutely across the board, right? So we're seeing inbounds come in.
