in AI infrastructure layer, foundation models there and then we started investing in more applications, basically. So we're looking at applications across lower ventures. Has been around for a little over 24 years now, we invest in areas that are, broadly speaking, pushing the boundaries of compute and connectivity. That's the mission statement for the companies. That's essentially mission statement for us as well. And so we and what that translates to. It changes over the years. It's changed a lot for my career at work on as well. Of course, mobile remains the largest part of our business. Mobile revenues about $30 million so, but we have pretty sizable businesses now in automotive and IoT and Cloud and

it's now. Now we're pretty confident that we can scale that business really well and so. So a lot of that is driven by moving AI workloads to where we are. We happen to be in the edge and then, or even in the cloud now, with AI inferences with a better TCO advantage. So we invest in startups as we're looking to invest in startups in AI space. We try to enable partnerships where such a partner or becomes a customer as well. Or the third one is more, which is we can provide a TC web startups by running

question so you say, really, Qualcomm becomes a customer. Quacom is a huge company, and in terms of technology stacks, must be running a whole bunch of stacks, right? So why is it rare?

But given the size of the company, as you can imagine, we're already like, typically, whenever a startup engagement starts, you're trying to display something that the companies already use. Those conversations just take a long, long time, rarely compared to the other two, which is not rarely, I would say, like it's it happens, but it's not like in a lot of cases, for whatever reason. I mean, the right intersection point with Qualcomm becoming a customer of a startup, typically, is at a series D stage. The reason why is because we want to de risk our IT teams and our engineering teams want to be risk and engagement with a startup by because that whatever we might be using, that migration involves a lot of risk for whoever wants to drive so now the value proposition has to be significantly large in order to for us to take on that risk. And in some cases, I'll give you an example where recently happened, which is customer engineering. This was like a huge profit. We were actually sort of displacing something bad, right? The idea was to close customer engineering tickets faster systems to be able to close customer engineering tickets faster. So in that case, we actually ended up giving a contract to a company that was able to prove that they had a solution in the sparse period, whatever we were using before, and there was an urgency enough to be able to move and then, so we were able to take on however, it was like a big thing, because it's a big contract. It's a huge dependency, and we have this risk of,

yeah, that's the reason. But,

Speaker 2
Well, yeah, I mean, so we are. We only deal with the fortune 1000 companies now, longer sales cycles are, you know, par for the course. The main thing is, I compared to my previous life at Nutanix. No, I see that even the larger companies are open to new technologies with some urgency, which was not the case in earlier times when we were selling, everybody is panicking, even though even Pepsi's of the world are panicking.

what we operate. And last quarter, we closed a bank. And I was not thinking that, hey, a bank will buy from a series, a startup, and Gen AI and all of that. But it's actually happening. Yeah, I think the world is moving really fast. So okay. Background on myself. I started this company four years ago. Before that, there was a CTO at a company called Nutanix. Was there for eight years. We grew with a handful of friends to IPO and beyond. Great journey. Wanted to do something by myself after

need and have that much of an ambition left, which is kind of bothers me, but we did reach across to eight, 10 million in market cap and 1.5 billion revenues. Very good for that, I was in I can research eight years working on bringing flash technology from consumer devices to enterprise storage. I've spent my time on enterprise storage, and then at honeys, I grew from the company also grew from storage to building our own hypervisor, then building our own networking, virtual networking, then managing applications, databases, and finally, the entire stack. So I got closer to the application layer, the business layer and all of that, working with the VP of Finance there, where we were trying to see how to change our consumption model from every TCO based purchase orders to model. Working with them, I realized that we were using people manual order to do all the finance processes, API, even expenses we had expensified. I was surprised to see there are three, four people reviewing it like, what was their fraud? Whatever. And that was my introduction to that world where there's a lot of inefficiency while working in a high tech company. And I asked, maybe not automatically in the cloud, and he was saying, like, I don't know how to manage developers, right? So? And I said, you need developers. Like, he had worked hard to hear me. And he said, whatever you're saying, I can't do with these tools. And I said, Use UiPath. And he said, Yeah, where will I get the developer from, right? I mean, it doesn't have an RPA developer, and I don't want to give them the budget for and it was a small project. It was not happening anyway. It was not. Main thing in my mind is like, Okay, fine. I just had my developers do it, and we went ahead. But during the pandemic, is when I realized that I got, I got to do something about this. I was, I watched my son learn Python and struggle. And I wrote a blog on that. I realized that the next generation so we are not going to exponentially have more and more Python developers. It's actually going to struggle a little bit more now because my son told me he doesn't want to do it because Alexa understands English, that's what he said. Why are you forcing me to do this? And my realization was that the language of programming has to go up from these traditional programming languages to more natural, but not completely natural, because that people have tried multiple decades and failed I studied, but the thought process at pseudo code, which I taught my son in five minutes. He was 12 years old, pseudocode, that's what he mean, basically structured thinking and writing it still in English. Pseudocode is probably the next level of programming language, which is neither extremely flexible, where you're worrying about biases, hallucinations creeping in and like, what, what decisions AI made for you. Because English as a language does not enforce a level of precision. You could be as vague or as precise. Where is the boundary? But when you talk about pseudo code, we are demanding certain level of thought and precision. And when we talk about standard operating procedure in finance, the same thing is there like, it needs to be at a level that is like, level that is, like a developer, I know this. If this, then I'll do that, and stuff like that, structured thinking. So I thought four years ago that that's the system that is missing. It is going through that now pitch to various pieces. People said, man, what? You know, you just made your money. You know, you're just trying to make something cool. But no, I wanted, I saw the writing on the wall that the next generation is just not having the patience to learn Python. So started building that deep learning compiler, design, all of that, and I hired some basics working. And soon I realized, six months in, that actually it is not just the language that is the problem that makes software hard or automation hard. It's when things fail, because when my stuff was filling, I was looking at stack traces, that's not pseudo code, right? And I was like, nobody understands this. In fact, that is the real problem. It's not the language. And then I realized, why nobody, like everybody, says no code, no code. Drag and drop is great, but I don't use it. So for anything real, you have to use a language, and you have to be able to debugging that language, and so no amount of translation will work. English to Python doesn't work because it fails in Python. It doesn't fail in English. And that's the probability with agentic stuff. Agentic, I speak in English, but it executes a Python, and it fails in Python. So I had to build something from scratch where it will fail in English, because the interpreter itself is an English interpreter. It doesn't translate it into anything. So that's the level at which it needs to work. And again, I started working on it, and now this is four years into it, and we have company. And also know the world works it. So that's a quick history. Here

It's when things fail, because when my stuff was filling, I was looking at stack traces, that's not pseudo code, right? And I was like, nobody understands this. In fact, that is the real problem. It's not the language. And then I realized, why nobody, like everybody, says no code, no code. Drag and drop is great, but I don't use it. So for anything real, you have to use a language, and you have to be able to debugging that language, and so no amount of translation will work. English to Python doesn't work because it fails in Python. It doesn't fail in English. And that's the probability with agentic stuff. Agentic, I speak in English, but it executes a Python, and it fails in Python. So I had to build something from scratch where it will fail in English, because the interpreter itself is an English interpreter. It doesn't translate it into anything. So that's the level at which it needs to work. And again, I started working on it, and now this is four years into it, and we have company. And also know the world works it. So that's a quick history. Here
need and have that much of an ambition left, which is kind of bothers me, but we did reach across to eight, 10 million in market cap and 1.5 billion revenues. Very good for that, I was in I can research eight years working on bringing flash technology from consumer devices to enterprise storage. I've spent my time on enterprise storage, and then at honeys, I grew from the company also grew from storage to building our own hypervisor, then building our own networking, virtual networking, then managing applications, databases, and finally, the entire stack. So I got closer to the application layer, the business layer and all of that, working with the VP of Finance there, where we were trying to see how to change our consumption model from every TCO based purchase orders to model. Working with them, I realized that we were using people manual order to do all the finance processes, API, even expenses we had expensified. I was surprised to see there are three, four people reviewing it like, what was their fraud? Whatever. And that was my introduction to that world where there's a lot of inefficiency while working in a high tech company. And I asked, maybe not automatically in the cloud, and he was saying, like, I don't know how to manage developers, right? So? And I said, you need developers. Like, he had worked hard to hear me. And he said, whatever you're saying, I can't do with these tools. And I said, Use UiPath. And he said, Yeah, where will I get the developer from, right? I mean, it doesn't have an RPA developer, and I don't want to give them the budget for and it was a small project. It was not happening anyway. It was not. Main thing in my mind is like, Okay, fine. I just had my developers do it, and we went ahead. But during the pandemic, is when I realized that I got, I got to do something about this. I was, I watched my son learn Python and struggle. And I wrote a blog on that. I realized that the next generation so we are not going to exponentially have more and more Python developers. It's actually going to struggle a little bit more now because my son told me he doesn't want to do it because Alexa understands English, that's what he said. Why are you forcing me to do this? And my realization was that the language of programming has to go up from these traditional programming languages to more natural, but not completely natural, because that people have tried multiple decades and failed I studied, but the thought process at pseudo code, which I taught my son in five minutes. He was 12 years old, pseudocode, that's what he mean, basically structured thinking and writing it still in English. Pseudocode is probably the next level of programming language, which is neither extremely flexible, where you're worrying about biases, hallucinations creeping in and like, what, what decisions AI made for you. Because English as a language does not enforce a level of precision. You could be as vague or as precise. Where is the boundary? But when you talk about pseudo code, we are demanding certain level of thought and precision. And when we talk about standard operating procedure in finance, the same thing is there like, it needs to be at a level that is like, level that is, like a developer, I know this. If this, then I'll do that, and stuff like that, structured thinking. So I thought four years ago that that's the system that is missing. It is going through that now pitch to various pieces. People said, man, what? You know, you just made your money. You know, you're just trying to make something cool. But no, I wanted, I saw the writing on the wall that the next generation is just not having the patience to learn Python. So started building that deep learning compiler, design, all of that, and I hired some basics working. And soon I realized, six months in, that actually it is not just the language that is the problem that makes software hard or automation hard. It's when things fail, because when my stuff was filling, I was looking at stack traces, that's not pseudo code, right? And I was like, nobody understands this. In fact, that is the real problem.

So that's the level at which it needs to work. And again, I started working on it, and now this is four years into it, and we have company. And also know the world works it. So that's a quick history. Here
a few questions,
Speaker 1
you know. So agree with you. So why does pseudo code word and not my view on that is, I think, I think these AI systems are getting to a point where they can probably from my English, from enough examples of people speaking English and asking me to do things, probably at some point, even in the next two years, pretty good at understanding what the true motivation is. The challenge, although, I think, is going to be the I wrote the code, and once you execute it, it's doing exactly what you want to do.
you know. So agree with you. So why does pseudo code word and not my view on that is, I think, I think these AI systems are getting to a point where they can probably from my English, from enough examples of people speaking English and asking me to do things, probably at some point, even in the next two years, pretty good at understanding what the true motivation is.

But but me as a developer, does not understand

that lines of code and that code base is completely not familiar and out of control, something great and, let's say production, and it's a high value problem statement that you're trying to deploy and solve against load balancer for something. So guess what? You're never going to be able to build trust with those systems. So I think that's the I don't know. When do we cross that chasm? That would be a major chasm to build trust in these systems. It's
that lines of code and that code base is completely not familiar and out of control, something great and, let's say production, and it's a high value problem statement that you're trying to deploy and solve against load balancer for something.

That would be a major chasm to build trust in these systems. It's
Speaker 2
happening. It's happening. And that's the precise thing I believe, fundamentally, completely agree with you, and that is why I believe that the language that is generated, first of all, should be a language that the business side can understand, not Python. Number one, number two, should not become humongous. And my insights nine months into this project was the reason why code becomes humongous over time is the edge cases happy, pathology starts more like, you know, we can demo project, boom. Like, it's not that much lines of code. Oracle is still writing database logic today. Why? Because lightning structure or add another deadline support, right? Why? Though, when humans program say grandma's recipe for biryani that didn't become humongous in 20 years, it still remains the thing, because if there's a kitchen fire, grandma doesn't have to write anything else there. That's one problem. So computer science has not done that. Computer Science always forces the intelligence to light the application code, not in the underlying operating system. Windows is dumb, Mac is dumb. Application is smart. Human brain. The application is my recipe. The operating system is smart, right? That's why I bought it. Cognitos. The real thing is the OS has to be cognitive. The application becomes dumb. And that's why application doesn't load up and it becomes manageable. So that is the true insight, other than Okay, needs to be English, pythons. I got patent. If you look at Google, approved April as well for really application code running, it hits the problem. It now goes to the west level and to the user, gets an answer, and then comes back and resumes from that spot with new logic. That is what humans do all the time. We have the patent. That is the system that I actually implemented. And now we are taking into businesses so that they understand that the goal is not to get perfect automation. The goal is to get 8020 8020 80% with simple logic in English, instructions that everybody in the business understands. The 20% of the weird cases where you are making a decision, do you want to add code for it or just handle it manually for the foreseeable future? Up to you now when they say, okay, who's going to handle these edge cases? Which is the same person who doesn't manually today? So is that a loss? No, any more than going to handle it, so let them enter it, and the remaining entity gets automated. Okay, what used to be called a bug now is called as that's manual, and this is automated. Now when the person who does it manually handles it, the handle in our system, and then we look at the result and all of that. Now we're calling that. That gives you additional information for the process owner, saying that, Oh, I thought this is the process. But, you know, these are the 5% of the cases this other thing happens. I was not aware, but this subject matter experts know that they're never able to articulate all this review process discovery and all of that. But now you capture it. It's up to another process owner to figure out, should I improve my process, add more logic to it, or let it be manual, because it's actually an upstream department that needs to fix the problem. Why am I going to change my process? All this visibility comes in and large companies like Qualcomm and others have this thing, right? But now then, when the next comes out that you are not doing typical thought process in automation, UiPath, automation anywhere is like, let me get this straight through processing to 95% 99% and then I'll go to the next process. Here. We say, look here, 80% 20% is manual. Now either you can move 85 or with the same effort, you take another process, go to zero to 80, which the business says, oh, zero 20, because they're thinking money, not accuracy and not developer. The problem happens is, if you pull in a developer, when the failure happens, then all these people look for accuracy. The developer is super expensive resource. That's the fundamental thing. They're changing. And that's basically how humans work. You hire interns. You don't expect intern to 200% neither do you train them to 99% straight through processing. You say 80% remain Give it to me. 80% will many Give it to me, and over time, you will learn that's the model
happening. It's happening. And that's the precise thing I believe, fundamentally, completely agree with you, and that is why I believe that the language that is generated, first of all, should be a language that the business side can understand, not Python.

but more recently, after that, stock hasn't been doing well and all of that, the question is coming. Like Pepsi earlier said we won't increase UI math investment. So that's how we've been operating with them for six months now, not all of Pepsi, but one reasonable chunk of it. Just last week, they said, here are the 80 projects that we have see what you can rip up the rip and replace. That's interesting. I said, Why are you doing that's like, we're looking long term planning, and we don't want to be paying these extensions, and IBM's for the services around UiPath is like, sunk cost. I mean, that's fine. We paid an ELS, is the other thing. So if you can build it such that on the on the maintenance side, the business side, owns it, it does not own it, then they're like, we want to do that. So tell us, and then they'll do the computation. So that is also started

Exactly. So it's like it will always run once you test it in Logic is not going to change what our customers are in finance, if you know ABA, are order to cash, procure, to pay. Now there's no like, they don't like errors. I mean, although humans do make errors or 3% error, but from a platform, they're not expecting errors, but they're okay with manual so if we if we have lack of confidence right, that this is correct or not, then we have to black it and make it a manual thing, and then they look at it right? So we have multiple things. So you asked whether so in our platform, you can write just following step by step, just math, right? There's no llms involved, and there's a deep learning model that looks at your English statements to the code that translates it into grammatical translates it into grammatical structure. But that's hallucinating this old stuff. Okay. Then there are some other steps, which are OCR, kind of technology extract and all those things. Those give you confidence values, and those have been pretty decent. And again, that's what we do. Then there is layer about vision models, right? Those will give you sometimes hallucinations. So we have a layer where we merge the traditional OCR technology with the vision models to reduce hallucinations, but a lot of cross check and also give a confidence value all the things we do. And then finally, there could be, oh, I just want to call into open AI and get this block generated, or some something email generated that you do. Now, we advise our customers like, Okay, this is a business process. These are the steps where there is LLM. These are the steps that are not LLM, where the LLM steps are there. After that, you need to write some validation steps using non LLM technology. So those validation steps sometimes, for example, with the pro with their bank reconciliations, we do so an email comes in, somebody says, this is the invoice I paid much in your bank. Now the validation step is you take the invoice and check SAP whether this invoice actually exists. You know, if you don't, then you don't just go and say, Okay, this bad thing has happened. So there's a every business process they can figure out how to validate and therefore guard against AI hallucinations and stuff like that. So we give all the tools for them to go and make it happen revenue wise. So yeah, we raised series A last year, November, less than a million. Then right now, we are 2.3 and looking at Crossing 3.5 at the end of

It's been good. It's been at least a venture industry. It's been so fast. And I think I, like you were mentioning Hanson, was it wasn't anything like we weren't very academic. Job is, and certainly I'm learning about new industries every day in, day out. So it's been fast, it's been challenging. But the good kind of challenging, I'd say, yeah,
It's been good. It's been at least a venture industry. It's been so fast. And I think I, like you were mentioning Hanson, was it wasn't anything like we weren't very academic.

That's awesome. Glad to hear so Gautam, just a quick introduction to Priyesh. Is Priyesh to the same school as my partner, so the board felt the UCLA MBA, and just graduated. So he's recently started his role in Qualcomm ventures. And Priyesh Gautam is also with me at Haas, so we're partners for this, for all the work that we have to do for this class.

ask you a bunch of questions that you can hopefully give us answers to fill up an entire, you know, written assignment with Yeah, and also it, like I mentioned, record some part of the like, some part of this conversation, just so that, because what we're expected to essentially submit is, like, both written and video assignments. So we kind of like both. But to give you context of what we're trying to do is that, you know, it's just a new venture finance class. It's talking about a lot of different kinds of financing beyond the traditional ones, like, you know, like VC or p so we chose corporate venture capital, and in particular we want to focus on like the semiconductor industry or enterprise, AI like these were the two broad domains that we picked up. And I know that Qualcomm in general looks at, it's called Qualcomm, right? Am I pronouncing it correctly?

No, I think that's largely it. We're just curious about, yeah, we were just curious about how finance works, like Kisha said. But yeah, we can just jump directly into the question.

Speaker 3
sure. So Qualcomm Ventures is the corporate venture arm of Qualcomm, and broadly, the team invests in areas to Qualcomm. So those would be anything around compute and connectivity. As you may know, Qualcomm is a leading player in Compute and hardware infrastructure, and we have our chips sold to a lot of mobile phones to start with, and then, more recently, we have expanded into automotive platforms. IoT, XR we're starting a new cloud inference platform as well. So there is been quite a lot of diversification in terms of the compute hardware that we provide. And the venture funds focus is to sort of make strategic investments downstream in Downstream technologies. So AI, like you mentioned, would be a downstream technology for all of our compute infrastructure. And in AI, we take a look at both the infrastructure layer and the application layer. We take a look at a lot of computer vision companies which align with our IoT strategy. We take a look at a lot of xr plays, ar, VR, and because we can then supply our chips to them, a lot of our companies are also in vehicle telematics, because that aligns with our automobile strategy. And then industrial automation, because we feel a lot of IoT plays there. So things which are aligned there as a fund. We are a global fund. We have offices in the US, Israel, China, India and Latin America. The US team is about 10 members. We have a mandate of about deploying 150 $280 million a year. And the team is based on the Bay Area and San Diego, where the Qualcomm headquarters is. And I'd say our check sizes, we are, preferably a Series A investor. Our check sizes would be between two to ten million our sweet spot is five to seven. And opportunistically, we do see but we then, otherwise, we invest anywhere between series A through C or D, okay, on the side as

Speaker 3
So this is, this is something that would vary from different corporate funds. And in my experience, I've seen some funds being very strategically relevant in that sense, and some not as much. I think we fall somewhere in the middle. For us, let's say, to give you a more like paint this picture better in about if I'm preparing an investment memo of 25 pages, strategic relevance would be probably one or two page in it. So it's not as big. We sort of try to paint a picture whether down the line, this company could use some of our hardware, could be a vendor and can partner, or we can co sell some of our hardware with them. Or could this be a consumer? Or could Qualcomm end up as a consumer, and eventually, if there is a play that we can strategically, sort of acquire the company, or not? So those are some things that we do take a look at. But the fund, especially at Qualcomm, the fund operates quite independently. All of our decisions are based within the investment team, and we have a final stage of discussion with the business units. But before that, that's basically just a formality. I'd say it's not as relevant and most of it, we prefer to operate as a financial fund. Yeah, can I

Speaker 8
ask who this, or what team primarily sponsors the fund, or which team sponsor the fund, and what does what's a typical like return expectation? Because I understand, if you're a CVC, it's not necessarily just financial returns, like, I know you do strategic investments, but how do you measure it in terms of what you're getting back on what you put
ask who this, or what team primarily sponsors the fund, or which team sponsor the fund, and what does what's a typical like return expectation?

Makes sense in a certain time period.
Makes sense in a certain time period.
Makes sense in a certain time period.
Makes sense in a certain time period.
Speaker 3
Yeah, that's why it's confusing, for sure, and it does not align well with a lot of financial principles, but we do not have a time period put on it.
Yeah, that's why it's confusing, for sure, and it does not align well with a lot of financial principles, but we do not have a time period put on it.

Yeah. Okay, so you're basically looking at a 3x return at some point. Yeah,

Yeah. Okay, so you're basically looking at a 3x return at some point. Yeah,
Yeah. Okay, so you're basically looking at a 3x return at some point. Yeah,
three to five, I'd say yeah, eight to 5x return.

three to five, I'd say yeah, eight to 5x return.
three to five, I'd say yeah, eight to 5x return.
Speaker 5
Okay. Yeah. And
Speaker 8
one more thing is, I think I've spoken to Rama from the India team. Is the MD In the India team. I was just curious. So do other Qualcomm interests teams around the world operate on similar mandates. Do you feed into those, or do they operate independently?
one more thing is, I think I've spoken to Rama from the India team. Is the MD In the India team. I was just curious. So do other Qualcomm interests teams around the world operate on similar mandates. Do you feed into those, or do they operate independently?

Speaker 3
So they do not have a fixed mandate in terms of capital deployment, in terms of the areas we look at? Yes, it's similar for all of the global teams. And then yes, we interact frequently. So when there is an investment that some that, and like they have an initial set of discussion within the local teams. And then we set up something that we call, like a stage one team that comprises of all the global investment managers. So there are few people who get selected for every stage one evaluation, then there's a stage two evaluation, then there's an IC committee meeting. So for those stage one, stage two discussions, the Indian team would interact with the US team, or some other global team as well. Yeah,
So they do not have a fixed mandate in terms of capital deployment, in terms of the areas we look at? Yes, it's similar for all of the global teams. And then yes, we interact frequently.

interesting. Okay, got it.

Speaker 7
Um, so, so you mentioned, like, you mentioned, a little bit about just objectives that, you know, drive the investments of business unit, driving would be one part of it, and otherwise just newer technologies. But if you had to, like, give me, like, Is there, like, like, is there anything else that we're missing? Like, what? What else would be the objective to, how would you decide, basically,
Um, so, so you mentioned, like, you mentioned, a little bit about just objectives that, you know, drive the investments of business unit, driving would be one part of it, and otherwise just newer technologies.

But if you had to, like, give me, like, Is there, like, like, is there anything else that we're missing? Like, what? What else would be the objective to, how would you decide, basically,
whether to make an investment or not, or whether to pursue

whether to make an investment or not, or whether to pursue
whether to make an investment or not, or whether to pursue
investment or not,
Speaker 3
in terms of just sort of evaluating one investment, it would broadly be very similar to how funds would look at it. So if it's quite early. We preferably like to operate as a deep tech fund. So we would look for in for founders who have had that deep Tech experience in the founding team and depends on the industry. So it's variable in that sense, I'd say. But if it's super early, team is very important. Technical founding team is something we particularly prefer to look at we are valuation sensitive. So unlike a lot of financial funds, which have deep pockets and can lead a lot of follow up rounds, we prefer to sort of ground ourselves in better valuations. So that is one another factor that differentiates us,
in terms of just sort of evaluating one investment, it would broadly be very similar to how funds would look at it. So if it's quite early. We preferably like to operate as a deep tech fund.

in terms of just sort of evaluating one investment, it would broadly be very similar to how funds would look at it. So if it's quite early. We preferably like to operate as a deep tech fund. So we would look for in for founders who have had that deep Tech experience in the founding team and depends on the industry. So it's variable in that sense, I'd say. But if it's super early, team is very important. Technical founding team is something we particularly prefer to look at we are valuation sensitive. So unlike a lot of financial funds, which have deep pockets and can lead a lot of follow up rounds, we prefer to sort of ground ourselves in better valuations. So that is one another factor that differentiates us,
what else I'd say?
Speaker 3
We try to sort of create a story around strategic relevance. So like the few factors I mentioned earlier, whether they can be a customer and acquisition target can be a co bank, co branded, packaged selling opportunity, something like that. If it's a late stage company, we evaluate all of the metrics the team, the depends on the industry, whether it is enterprise or consumer, all of the relevant metrics around that. And in terms of sector, I guess sector isn't as flexible, so that's more of a, I would say, the broader teams discussion on it. So very initially, we wanted to do a lot of AI infrastructure investments, because we felt most of the applications are just wrappers on these infrastructure layers, and they might not win. Over the years, we have seen good outcomes come out of it. And hence, now, more recently, we have started focusing on applications as well. So those are more, I would say, broader team level discussions, if we wouldn't do things like a healthcare investment, because that's nowhere relevant to us, or things like that. But robotics is something we took a look at. It died down then with the AI generation, with the entire generative AI resurgence, Robotics has picked up, so we started looking at it again. So in that sense, we try to be opportunistic, if there is a story to play with Qualcomm, and then if that market makes sense, we took, we take a more strategic look at

it. Got it makes sense, and and how, how? How is the process like pitching to you? Is it typically through banks that recommend particular like company that you know would be relevant to you? Or do you also take in like pitches from founders directly? I'm sure you know, you would always be started by people trying to get some sort of association.

So I'd say it's usually, if I were to give you a number, probably less than 10% would be reference coming from banks, especially because we operate in the world of seed, Series A, Series B, that's most of our investments would be so it's probably way too early for an investment bank will be involved. The team has been around for quite a long time, so it's the fund has been operating for 26 years, and hence we have had a lot of CO investments with some really good funds, and the team also has some very well established venture funds. And venture funds do recommend quite a lot of deals to us. And then, at times, we create a thesis around a space. So personally, I'm looking at the AI agent space right now and how voice AI can sort of transform a few areas, and based on that broader theory, evaluate a few trends that then see a bunch of companies, and we make outreaches as well. So a lot of it is, I would say, VC driven. It is referral from other VCs, from founders that we have invested in before, and then some part of it is also poor outreach. I had seen

a couple of a couple of clients I worked with back in India when I was in consulting their cop dev team or their CVC team would also be LPS in certain VC firms like, say, Bloom, for example, would have Cisco ventures as one of their LPs.

Speaker 3
1:00:15
we don't that. We don't do that in the US. We feel we have quite a strong presence here and hence, and a very strong team as well. But we have made an investment in our fund in Brazil, and are sort of entering into a new geography in terms of venture investing. We may adopt that strategy, but I don't think we do that in us or India or China, where we already have, as a corporate or as a venture fund, a strong presence,

Got it? Should we, like shift gears to just understanding a little bit about Priyesh role for them, like just in terms of flexible and things like that.

that it also works similarly with, like corporate venture capital, because usually, if you go to some of these, if you, if you follow certain, like, big sourcing areas, like it's safe, maybe YC, or whatever, whatever gets featured on Tech Crunch, since you're doing, say, investments, I feel like you wouldn't have, like, 18 months, like 12 to 24 months of Head Start, of already looking into some companies before they Come to a series a stage where you can invest in them, which means that they already have some PR, which means you already have some face time. But it's interesting to know that you still need to build your network, which is tap into like as early stage as possible, no pools of people who are working on interesting things. Yeah.

1:05:22
and I think that's slightly confusing, because getting to know a company is one thing, but there, there you, if you are in the venture world, you are kind of too broad a bucket of companies that are operating. One set of companies are seeking funds, and there are one set of companies in which people want to put that check in, and then they are the ones who decide who they want to get on the cap table. So the networking part of it also comes into play when you have an established brand presence, and you as an investor can say that I will add this specifically, can stack, take my check versus someone else's cool.

Sure. So acquaintance, we operate broadly as a financial fund, but we do take a look at if there are any strategic synergies with the broader Qualcomm strategy. In that sense, we evaluate whether the company would either be m and a prospect down the line, if they can co brand and sell their services with some of our current offerings, or if they can either serve Qualcomm as a customer or downstream serve some of our some of Qualcomm's customers as customer and Qualcomm and add those are Some place that we look at our mandates again, follow broadly Qualcomm strategy around compute and connectivity and hence all the stream areas which are enabled with that broader thesis is something that we look at

Speaker 3
1:08:14
sure. So I think there are two parts of it. There is the corporate part of it and the venture capital part of it, I would say targeting the venture capital part is pretty straight forward. One should have a good network so that they can tap into the right deal flow. One should understand which are the right metrics, right evaluation criteria to understand which companies they should be investing it in, and hence, competitive analysis, understanding how sales metrics happen and and then eventually creating those value in comparable would come in handy from a corporate venture fund perspective. I think what changes is really understanding whether, how do you strategize some of your investments, and bring those strategies back to the corporate fund. So at Qualcomm ventures, we take a look at a lot of companies which can broadly fit in our thesis, and we try to enable those business partnerships. Understanding what a particular fund or a particular corporate focus is and how they are trying to and what they're trying to achieve with their corporate fund would be interesting. Awesome. Sharing. I'm
sure. So I think there are two parts of it. There is the corporate part of it and the venture capital part of it, I would say targeting the venture capital part is pretty straight forward.

I think what changes is really understanding whether, how do you strategize some of your investments, and bring those strategies back to the corporate fund. So at Qualcomm ventures, we take a look at a lot of companies which can broadly fit in our thesis, and we try to enable those business partnerships. Understanding what a particular fund or a particular corporate focus is and how they are trying to and what they're trying to achieve with their corporate fund would be interesting. Awesome. Sharing. I'm
sure. So I think there are two parts of it. There is the corporate part of it and the venture capital part of it, I would say targeting the venture capital part is pretty straight forward.

Speaker 1
product at Qualcomm
have been investing in AI for the last seven years.
Investments in AI infrastructure
faces and devices
and scale a bunch of companies. So
Speaker 1
in AI infrastructure layer, foundation models there and then we started investing in more applications, basically. So we're looking at applications across lower ventures. Has been around for a little over 24 years now, we invest in areas that are, broadly speaking, pushing the boundaries of compute and connectivity. That's the mission statement for the companies. That's essentially mission statement for us as well. And so we and what that translates to. It changes over the years. It's changed a lot for my career at work on as well. Of course, mobile remains the largest part of our business. Mobile revenues about $30 million so, but we have pretty sizable businesses now in automotive and IoT and Cloud and
PCs and xr devices and
Speaker 1
networking and many more. And each one of these are sizable businesses. Some of these are more bad, so I would say cloud inferencing businesses
like PCs are new or bad, but
Speaker 1
it's now. Now we're pretty confident that we can scale that business really well and so. So a lot of that is driven by moving AI workloads to where we are. We happen to be in the edge and then, or even in the cloud now, with AI inferences with a better TCO advantage. So we invest in startups as we're looking to invest in startups in AI space. We try to enable partnerships where such a partner or becomes a customer as well. Or the third one is more, which is we can provide a TC web startups by running
so that's
Speaker 1
every year check sizes from five to $7 million initial check size, yeah,
that's another
Speaker 1
follow. I would say, however we participate, 80% of the tax, 20% percent. But
Speaker 2
question so you say, really, Qualcomm becomes a customer. Quacom is a huge company, and in terms of technology stacks, must be running a whole bunch of stacks, right? So why is it rare?
We've had many of our startups portfolio
that end up selling to quacom.
Speaker 1
But given the size of the company, as you can imagine, we're already like, typically, whenever a startup engagement starts, you're trying to display something that the companies already use. Those conversations just take a long, long time, rarely compared to the other two, which is not rarely, I would say, like it's it happens, but it's not like in a lot of cases, for whatever reason. I mean, the right intersection point with Qualcomm becoming a customer of a startup, typically, is at a series D stage. The reason why is because we want to de risk our IT teams and our engineering teams want to be risk and engagement with a startup by because that whatever we might be using, that migration involves a lot of risk for whoever wants to drive so now the value proposition has to be significantly large in order to for us to take on that risk. And in some cases, I'll give you an example where recently happened, which is customer engineering. This was like a huge profit. We were actually sort of displacing something bad, right? The idea was to close customer engineering tickets faster systems to be able to close customer engineering tickets faster. So in that case, we actually ended up giving a contract to a company that was able to prove that they had a solution in the sparse period, whatever we were using before, and there was an urgency enough to be able to move and then, so we were able to take on however, it was like a big thing, because it's a big contract. It's a huge dependency, and we have this risk of,
what if the startup goes away? So,
yeah, that's the reason. But,
I mean, we've done it. It's not we do it all the time.
It's longer sales cycles, is what I'm saying.
Speaker 2
Well, yeah, I mean, so we are. We only deal with the fortune 1000 companies now, longer sales cycles are, you know, par for the course. The main thing is, I compared to my previous life at Nutanix. No, I see that even the larger companies are open to new technologies with some urgency, which was not the case in earlier times when we were selling, everybody is panicking, even though even Pepsi's of the world are panicking.
Speaker 1
AI is essentially is driven through CIOs and coos within the companies and CFOs within the CFOs are saying, Can I get better operational efficiencies such that I can reduce my optics, yeah, and that's
Speaker 2
what we operate. And last quarter, we closed a bank. And I was not thinking that, hey, a bank will buy from a series, a startup, and Gen AI and all of that. But it's actually happening. Yeah, I think the world is moving really fast. So okay. Background on myself. I started this company four years ago. Before that, there was a CTO at a company called Nutanix. Was there for eight years. We grew with a handful of friends to IPO and beyond. Great journey. Wanted to do something by myself after
post IPO, things are stagnating, and, you know,
Speaker 2
need and have that much of an ambition left, which is kind of bothers me, but we did reach across to eight, 10 million in market cap and 1.5 billion revenues. Very good for that, I was in I can research eight years working on bringing flash technology from consumer devices to enterprise storage. I've spent my time on enterprise storage, and then at honeys, I grew from the company also grew from storage to building our own hypervisor, then building our own networking, virtual networking, then managing applications, databases, and finally, the entire stack. So I got closer to the application layer, the business layer and all of that, working with the VP of Finance there, where we were trying to see how to change our consumption model from every TCO based purchase orders to model. Working with them, I realized that we were using people manual order to do all the finance processes, API, even expenses we had expensified. I was surprised to see there are three, four people reviewing it like, what was their fraud? Whatever. And that was my introduction to that world where there's a lot of inefficiency while working in a high tech company. And I asked, maybe not automatically in the cloud, and he was saying, like, I don't know how to manage developers, right? So? And I said, you need developers. Like, he had worked hard to hear me. And he said, whatever you're saying, I can't do with these tools. And I said, Use UiPath. And he said, Yeah, where will I get the developer from, right? I mean, it doesn't have an RPA developer, and I don't want to give them the budget for and it was a small project. It was not happening anyway. It was not. Main thing in my mind is like, Okay, fine. I just had my developers do it, and we went ahead. But during the pandemic, is when I realized that I got, I got to do something about this. I was, I watched my son learn Python and struggle. And I wrote a blog on that. I realized that the next generation so we are not going to exponentially have more and more Python developers. It's actually going to struggle a little bit more now because my son told me he doesn't want to do it because Alexa understands English, that's what he said. Why are you forcing me to do this? And my realization was that the language of programming has to go up from these traditional programming languages to more natural, but not completely natural, because that people have tried multiple decades and failed I studied, but the thought process at pseudo code, which I taught my son in five minutes. He was 12 years old, pseudocode, that's what he mean, basically structured thinking and writing it still in English. Pseudocode is probably the next level of programming language, which is neither extremely flexible, where you're worrying about biases, hallucinations creeping in and like, what, what decisions AI made for you. Because English as a language does not enforce a level of precision. You could be as vague or as precise. Where is the boundary? But when you talk about pseudo code, we are demanding certain level of thought and precision. And when we talk about standard operating procedure in finance, the same thing is there like, it needs to be at a level that is like, level that is, like a developer, I know this. If this, then I'll do that, and stuff like that, structured thinking. So I thought four years ago that that's the system that is missing. It is going through that now pitch to various pieces. People said, man, what? You know, you just made your money. You know, you're just trying to make something cool. But no, I wanted, I saw the writing on the wall that the next generation is just not having the patience to learn Python. So started building that deep learning compiler, design, all of that, and I hired some basics working. And soon I realized, six months in, that actually it is not just the language that is the problem that makes software hard or automation hard. It's when things fail, because when my stuff was filling, I was looking at stack traces, that's not pseudo code, right? And I was like, nobody understands this. In fact, that is the real problem. It's not the language. And then I realized, why nobody, like everybody, says no code, no code. Drag and drop is great, but I don't use it. So for anything real, you have to use a language, and you have to be able to debugging that language, and so no amount of translation will work. English to Python doesn't work because it fails in Python. It doesn't fail in English. And that's the probability with agentic stuff. Agentic, I speak in English, but it executes a Python, and it fails in Python. So I had to build something from scratch where it will fail in English, because the interpreter itself is an English interpreter. It doesn't translate it into anything. So that's the level at which it needs to work. And again, I started working on it, and now this is four years into it, and we have company. And also know the world works it. So that's a quick history. Here
a few questions,
Speaker 1
you know. So agree with you. So why does pseudo code word and not my view on that is, I think, I think these AI systems are getting to a point where they can probably from my English, from enough examples of people speaking English and asking me to do things, probably at some point, even in the next two years, pretty good at understanding what the true motivation is. The challenge, although, I think, is going to be the I wrote the code, and once you execute it, it's doing exactly what you want to do.
But but me as a developer, does not understand
Speaker 1
that lines of code and that code base is completely not familiar and out of control, something great and, let's say production, and it's a high value problem statement that you're trying to deploy and solve against load balancer for something. So guess what? You're never going to be able to build trust with those systems. So I think that's the I don't know. When do we cross that chasm? That would be a major chasm to build trust in these systems. It's
Speaker 2
happening. It's happening. And that's the precise thing I believe, fundamentally, completely agree with you, and that is why I believe that the language that is generated, first of all, should be a language that the business side can understand, not Python. Number one, number two, should not become humongous. And my insights nine months into this project was the reason why code becomes humongous over time is the edge cases happy, pathology starts more like, you know, we can demo project, boom. Like, it's not that much lines of code. Oracle is still writing database logic today. Why? Because lightning structure or add another deadline support, right? Why? Though, when humans program say grandma's recipe for biryani that didn't become humongous in 20 years, it still remains the thing, because if there's a kitchen fire, grandma doesn't have to write anything else there. That's one problem. So computer science has not done that. Computer Science always forces the intelligence to light the application code, not in the underlying operating system. Windows is dumb, Mac is dumb. Application is smart. Human brain. The application is my recipe. The operating system is smart, right? That's why I bought it. Cognitos. The real thing is the OS has to be cognitive. The application becomes dumb. And that's why application doesn't load up and it becomes manageable. So that is the true insight, other than Okay, needs to be English, pythons. I got patent. If you look at Google, approved April as well for really application code running, it hits the problem. It now goes to the west level and to the user, gets an answer, and then comes back and resumes from that spot with new logic. That is what humans do all the time. We have the patent. That is the system that I actually implemented. And now we are taking into businesses so that they understand that the goal is not to get perfect automation. The goal is to get 8020 8020 80% with simple logic in English, instructions that everybody in the business understands. The 20% of the weird cases where you are making a decision, do you want to add code for it or just handle it manually for the foreseeable future? Up to you now when they say, okay, who's going to handle these edge cases? Which is the same person who doesn't manually today? So is that a loss? No, any more than going to handle it, so let them enter it, and the remaining entity gets automated. Okay, what used to be called a bug now is called as that's manual, and this is automated. Now when the person who does it manually handles it, the handle in our system, and then we look at the result and all of that. Now we're calling that. That gives you additional information for the process owner, saying that, Oh, I thought this is the process. But, you know, these are the 5% of the cases this other thing happens. I was not aware, but this subject matter experts know that they're never able to articulate all this review process discovery and all of that. But now you capture it. It's up to another process owner to figure out, should I improve my process, add more logic to it, or let it be manual, because it's actually an upstream department that needs to fix the problem. Why am I going to change my process? All this visibility comes in and large companies like Qualcomm and others have this thing, right? But now then, when the next comes out that you are not doing typical thought process in automation, UiPath, automation anywhere is like, let me get this straight through processing to 95% 99% and then I'll go to the next process. Here. We say, look here, 80% 20% is manual. Now either you can move 85 or with the same effort, you take another process, go to zero to 80, which the business says, oh, zero 20, because they're thinking money, not accuracy and not developer. The problem happens is, if you pull in a developer, when the failure happens, then all these people look for accuracy. The developer is super expensive resource. That's the fundamental thing. They're changing. And that's basically how humans work. You hire interns. You don't expect intern to 200% neither do you train them to 99% straight through processing. You say 80% remain Give it to me. 80% will many Give it to me, and over time, you will learn that's the model
we're bringing in. Interesting. So you said you're selling
Speaker 2
primarily to 14,000 companies, yes. VP of Finance, VP of process improvement for these days, head of AI. Do you
displace your path? Or that,
Speaker 2
but more recently, after that, stock hasn't been doing well and all of that, the question is coming. Like Pepsi earlier said we won't increase UI math investment. So that's how we've been operating with them for six months now, not all of Pepsi, but one reasonable chunk of it. Just last week, they said, here are the 80 projects that we have see what you can rip up the rip and replace. That's interesting. I said, Why are you doing that's like, we're looking long term planning, and we don't want to be paying these extensions, and IBM's for the services around UiPath is like, sunk cost. I mean, that's fine. We paid an ELS, is the other thing. So if you can build it such that on the on the maintenance side, the business side, owns it, it does not own it, then they're like, we want to do that. So tell us, and then they'll do the computation. So that is also started
Speaker 1
so and so. So your tech stack is this, I mean purely LLM, LBM tech stack, or
Speaker 2
Speaker 1
we're doing. Okay? That's the only way you can guarantee what you said, 80% accuracy of once you do something, the accuracy of that is high enough, right? Because you compelling converting into a symbolic
Speaker 2
Exactly. So it's like it will always run once you test it in Logic is not going to change what our customers are in finance, if you know ABA, are order to cash, procure, to pay. Now there's no like, they don't like errors. I mean, although humans do make errors or 3% error, but from a platform, they're not expecting errors, but they're okay with manual so if we if we have lack of confidence right, that this is correct or not, then we have to black it and make it a manual thing, and then they look at it right? So we have multiple things. So you asked whether so in our platform, you can write just following step by step, just math, right? There's no llms involved, and there's a deep learning model that looks at your English statements to the code that translates it into grammatical translates it into grammatical structure. But that's hallucinating this old stuff. Okay. Then there are some other steps, which are OCR, kind of technology extract and all those things. Those give you confidence values, and those have been pretty decent. And again, that's what we do. Then there is layer about vision models, right? Those will give you sometimes hallucinations. So we have a layer where we merge the traditional OCR technology with the vision models to reduce hallucinations, but a lot of cross check and also give a confidence value all the things we do. And then finally, there could be, oh, I just want to call into open AI and get this block generated, or some something email generated that you do. Now, we advise our customers like, Okay, this is a business process. These are the steps where there is LLM. These are the steps that are not LLM, where the LLM steps are there. After that, you need to write some validation steps using non LLM technology. So those validation steps sometimes, for example, with the pro with their bank reconciliations, we do so an email comes in, somebody says, this is the invoice I paid much in your bank. Now the validation step is you take the invoice and check SAP whether this invoice actually exists. You know, if you don't, then you don't just go and say, Okay, this bad thing has happened. So there's a every business process they can figure out how to validate and therefore guard against AI hallucinations and stuff like that. So we give all the tools for them to go and make it happen revenue wise. So yeah, we raised series A last year, November, less than a million. Then right now, we are 2.3 and looking at Crossing 3.5 at the end of
Speaker 1
the year, 3.5 this year is what you've done. And how much have you raised?
Total? We have raised in our lifetime, 30 million.
I looking to raise again? Yeah, January,
so it was with COSLA at 90 post. I
I guess
the question is going to be, I'm sure
everybody finished this, the question is going to be,
next round, your prior round
with that 90 question,
like participating
Speaker 2
for us within two to 10 million, so you basically target load. Well, how does it work?
Speaker 1
So no initial check sizes, $2 million check size, typically. I mean, essentially, what we have to
figure out is a
Speaker 1
path to return check size.
So and then we have to figure out what is
Speaker 1
so however, we are valuation sensitive, extremely sensitive. So
Speaker 2
I would suggest that's fine. I would suggest, like, let's figure out if Qualcomm can use our technology
Speaker 1
Speaker 2
Well, so abar, that's one or if it's a manufacturing kind of thing, then a lot of the now, then it's ABL,
Speaker 1
okay, so, so then I'm going to reach out to Financing.
Thanks. It was a pleasure
talking. Priyesh, thank you. But I did,
Speaker 3
Delhi, 1990 or India rank nine. So here, but yeah, the marks about million company.
Speaker 1
I ended up spending three hours out of the day on things like my fifth pitch and all of these. I think there was probably one that was
interesting. So
Speaker 4
I pressed it up. So that's fine. I mean, there's
Speaker 1
many others that are more interesting while dealing with something that has a problem, get things ongoing as fast as this could grow, but that's fine with us, and all of that is going to be like met figure. Okay. Tomorrow,
I will join the morning. Call with you before leaving.
I might be on my phone,
Speaker 1
but I joined. They're going to introduce after the 2080 anything else from
any other from yesterday,
Speaker 4
I am halfway through the slides. You asked me to prepare to show if I'll get you them before the end of day today, I had to work on some
Speaker 1
to schedule that call with another update. Then let's hang up. Let's go back to building those. Have fun in Vegas and get I don't know what ending stuff like Vegas right now. A friend of mine just came back. It's still things are COVID. So supposedly, a bunch of things going on in Vegas. But it's always fun. I'm
staying at IO one,
Speaker 4
one quick thing I wanted to run by you Bucha, during the presentation with Russia, he mentioned hybrid AI and how we are using a small few tokens. Use that to verify that's exactly the concept that recursively I was working on. You remember that guy, Eugene? Is it worth closed? We can engage Rashi
with Eugene. Yes. Set
the material from Eugene to rushing.
And why don't
you take that, make that introduction, send it
Speaker 1
rushing. CC me, Okay, send Eugene. Send it rush. You. I think Eugene stuff is interesting, also for this other team, but
Speaker 4
okay, and on this agent of ops needing to start, where are you guys exactly going to be? I found out a few conferences I spoke
Speaker 1
with Carlos. Carlos said, Hey, instead of doing them, should we just do it in San Carlos over the next few weeks with him, because then we can invite more people on our team. So that it's easier for you and all that, but let's just do it in San Carlos, okay,
Speaker 4
okay, sure. I'll just drop in a message that we come back with when you might
Speaker 1
Yeah, it's otherwise it's harder to do it over there. You'll have to figure out logistics already. My
Speaker 4
You Done? Thank You.
Enough. That's
Speaker 5
Thank You. How about Thank you. Such,
Hello, I Know click, again.
Speaker 6
Okay, You
Speaker 6
Can hear
Jo My Second
that So much
Memory. Wait A
Minute.
Me, oh, Fuck yeah.
Yeah, I
fiance, Bucha,
yeah, sorry, Sorry,
See you. Bye.
Hey, Priyesh, how you doing? Hey, hi,
good. Thanks a lot for doing this. Yeah, for sure,
get good grades. Thanks to you.
Yeah, grades do come in handy, I guess.
Speaker 7
I mean, they don't, really, but honestly, like people at house really take grades, like, they take all of this stuff very seriously. So I realized, like, like, I'm doing my MBA from lbs, yeah, but I'm doing a, like, like, an exchange semester at Haas, and all the classes just require a lot of work. It's just a lot of work, but it's good, I guess. Yeah,
Speaker 3
it's probably just us. UCLA wasn't anything like this.
I know LPS not like that at all,
Speaker 7
you know? So that's why I'm just here and I'm just like, Oh my God. Like, this is like a lot of work I can imagine.
Sorry, I didn't get you
graduated. Yeah, yeah.
I don't think we
met at any point,
Speaker 3
right? I don't think we met either, but I've heard about you quite a lot. I've seen you at events, or at least in stories and stuff, but never got a chance to meet Patrick. Oh,
Speaker 4
good things. Definitely, definitely. Yeah, yeah. Awesome. Gautam is
here. Gautam is also from us. Oh, can
you hear me? Yes,
but we can't see
I'm trying to figure that out. Just give me okay,
Speaker 7
then for you, Priyesh, from like back to like student to like a working professional. How's that going.
Speaker 3
It's been good. It's been at least a venture industry. It's been so fast. And I think I, like you were mentioning Hanson, was it wasn't anything like we weren't very academic. Job is, and certainly I'm learning about new industries every day in, day out. So it's been fast, it's been challenging. But the good kind of challenging, I'd say, yeah,
Speaker 7
yeah. And I think after two years of like, chilling, you're also like, okay, fine, you know, let's
Speaker 7
let's really earn the money and, you know, work towards it or whatever,
Speaker 3
right, right? It's been interesting. I really wanted to make this pivot into ventures. I'm glad it happened, and I'm enjoying the role.
Speaker 7
That's awesome. Glad to hear so Gautam, just a quick introduction to Priyesh. Is Priyesh to the same school as my partner, so the board felt the UCLA MBA, and just graduated. So he's recently started his role in Qualcomm ventures. And Priyesh Gautam is also with me at Haas, so we're partners for this, for all the work that we have to do for this class.
Nice to meet you. Adam, Hi,
glad to see you. Priyesh,
awesome. So, Priyesh, what we
Speaker 7
ask you a bunch of questions that you can hopefully give us answers to fill up an entire, you know, written assignment with Yeah, and also it, like I mentioned, record some part of the like, some part of this conversation, just so that, because what we're expected to essentially submit is, like, both written and video assignments. So we kind of like both. But to give you context of what we're trying to do is that, you know, it's just a new venture finance class. It's talking about a lot of different kinds of financing beyond the traditional ones, like, you know, like VC or p so we chose corporate venture capital, and in particular we want to focus on like the semiconductor industry or enterprise, AI like these were the two broad domains that we picked up. And I know that Qualcomm in general looks at, it's called Qualcomm, right? Am I pronouncing it correctly?
Yeah, it's called com
Speaker 7
I know Qualcomm looks at like the semiconductor industry and a lot of other technologies, so, you know. So, yeah, we'll just, we just have, like, a bunch of questions to know more about this. Sure, let me know if you
haven't. No, we can just, yeah,
Speaker 7
awesome. Anything else from you Gotham, any other context that you think is necessary?
Speaker 8
No, I think that's largely it. We're just curious about, yeah, we were just curious about how finance works, like Kisha said. But yeah, we can just jump directly into the question.
Speaker 7
Awesome. So Priyesh, do you want to just start by telling us a little bit about, like, what your focus is, like at Qualcomm, because I think that would set the stage for just all the other questions that follow, for
Speaker 3
sure. So Qualcomm Ventures is the corporate venture arm of Qualcomm, and broadly, the team invests in areas to Qualcomm. So those would be anything around compute and connectivity. As you may know, Qualcomm is a leading player in Compute and hardware infrastructure, and we have our chips sold to a lot of mobile phones to start with, and then, more recently, we have expanded into automotive platforms. IoT, XR we're starting a new cloud inference platform as well. So there is been quite a lot of diversification in terms of the compute hardware that we provide. And the venture funds focus is to sort of make strategic investments downstream in Downstream technologies. So AI, like you mentioned, would be a downstream technology for all of our compute infrastructure. And in AI, we take a look at both the infrastructure layer and the application layer. We take a look at a lot of computer vision companies which align with our IoT strategy. We take a look at a lot of xr plays, ar, VR, and because we can then supply our chips to them, a lot of our companies are also in vehicle telematics, because that aligns with our automobile strategy. And then industrial automation, because we feel a lot of IoT plays there. So things which are aligned there as a fund. We are a global fund. We have offices in the US, Israel, China, India and Latin America. The US team is about 10 members. We have a mandate of about deploying 150 $280 million a year. And the team is based on the Bay Area and San Diego, where the Qualcomm headquarters is. And I'd say our check sizes, we are, preferably a Series A investor. Our check sizes would be between two to ten million our sweet spot is five to seven. And opportunistically, we do see but we then, otherwise, we invest anywhere between series A through C or D, okay, on the side as
Speaker 7
Speaker 3
So this is, this is something that would vary from different corporate funds. And in my experience, I've seen some funds being very strategically relevant in that sense, and some not as much. I think we fall somewhere in the middle. For us, let's say, to give you a more like paint this picture better in about if I'm preparing an investment memo of 25 pages, strategic relevance would be probably one or two page in it. So it's not as big. We sort of try to paint a picture whether down the line, this company could use some of our hardware, could be a vendor and can partner, or we can co sell some of our hardware with them. Or could this be a consumer? Or could Qualcomm end up as a consumer, and eventually, if there is a play that we can strategically, sort of acquire the company, or not? So those are some things that we do take a look at. But the fund, especially at Qualcomm, the fund operates quite independently. All of our decisions are based within the investment team, and we have a final stage of discussion with the business units. But before that, that's basically just a formality. I'd say it's not as relevant and most of it, we prefer to operate as a financial fund. Yeah, can I
Speaker 8
ask who this, or what team primarily sponsors the fund, or which team sponsor the fund, and what does what's a typical like return expectation? Because I understand, if you're a CVC, it's not necessarily just financial returns, like, I know you do strategic investments, but how do you measure it in terms of what you're getting back on what you put
Speaker 3
Makes sense in a certain time period.
Speaker 3
Yeah, that's why it's confusing, for sure, and it does not align well with a lot of financial principles, but we do not have a time period put on it.
Speaker 7
Yeah. Okay, so you're basically looking at a 3x return at some point. Yeah,
three to five, I'd say yeah, eight to 5x return.
Speaker 5
Okay. Yeah. And
Speaker 8
one more thing is, I think I've spoken to Rama from the India team. Is the MD In the India team. I was just curious. So do other Qualcomm interests teams around the world operate on similar mandates. Do you feed into those, or do they operate independently?
Speaker 3
So they do not have a fixed mandate in terms of capital deployment, in terms of the areas we look at? Yes, it's similar for all of the global teams. And then yes, we interact frequently. So when there is an investment that some that, and like they have an initial set of discussion within the local teams. And then we set up something that we call, like a stage one team that comprises of all the global investment managers. So there are few people who get selected for every stage one evaluation, then there's a stage two evaluation, then there's an IC committee meeting. So for those stage one, stage two discussions, the Indian team would interact with the US team, or some other global team as well. Yeah,
interesting. Okay, got it.
Speaker 7
Um, so, so you mentioned, like, you mentioned, a little bit about just objectives that, you know, drive the investments of business unit, driving would be one part of it, and otherwise just newer technologies. But if you had to, like, give me, like, Is there, like, like, is there anything else that we're missing? Like, what? What else would be the objective to, how would you decide, basically,
whether to make an investment or not, or whether to pursue
investment or not,
Speaker 3
in terms of just sort of evaluating one investment, it would broadly be very similar to how funds would look at it. So if it's quite early. We preferably like to operate as a deep tech fund. So we would look for in for founders who have had that deep Tech experience in the founding team and depends on the industry. So it's variable in that sense, I'd say. But if it's super early, team is very important. Technical founding team is something we particularly prefer to look at we are valuation sensitive. So unlike a lot of financial funds, which have deep pockets and can lead a lot of follow up rounds, we prefer to sort of ground ourselves in better valuations. So that is one another factor that differentiates us,
what else I'd say?
Speaker 3
We try to sort of create a story around strategic relevance. So like the few factors I mentioned earlier, whether they can be a customer and acquisition target can be a co bank, co branded, packaged selling opportunity, something like that. If it's a late stage company, we evaluate all of the metrics the team, the depends on the industry, whether it is enterprise or consumer, all of the relevant metrics around that. And in terms of sector, I guess sector isn't as flexible, so that's more of a, I would say, the broader teams discussion on it. So very initially, we wanted to do a lot of AI infrastructure investments, because we felt most of the applications are just wrappers on these infrastructure layers, and they might not win. Over the years, we have seen good outcomes come out of it. And hence, now, more recently, we have started focusing on applications as well. So those are more, I would say, broader team level discussions, if we wouldn't do things like a healthcare investment, because that's nowhere relevant to us, or things like that. But robotics is something we took a look at. It died down then with the AI generation, with the entire generative AI resurgence, Robotics has picked up, so we started looking at it again. So in that sense, we try to be opportunistic, if there is a story to play with Qualcomm, and then if that market makes sense, we took, we take a more strategic look at
Speaker 7
it. Got it makes sense, and and how, how? How is the process like pitching to you? Is it typically through banks that recommend particular like company that you know would be relevant to you? Or do you also take in like pitches from founders directly? I'm sure you know, you would always be started by people trying to get some sort of association.
Speaker 3
So I'd say it's usually, if I were to give you a number, probably less than 10% would be reference coming from banks, especially because we operate in the world of seed, Series A, Series B, that's most of our investments would be so it's probably way too early for an investment bank will be involved. The team has been around for quite a long time, so it's the fund has been operating for 26 years, and hence we have had a lot of CO investments with some really good funds, and the team also has some very well established venture funds. And venture funds do recommend quite a lot of deals to us. And then, at times, we create a thesis around a space. So personally, I'm looking at the AI agent space right now and how voice AI can sort of transform a few areas, and based on that broader theory, evaluate a few trends that then see a bunch of companies, and we make outreaches as well. So a lot of it is, I would say, VC driven. It is referral from other VCs, from founders that we have invested in before, and then some part of it is also poor outreach. I had seen
Speaker 8
a couple of a couple of clients I worked with back in India when I was in consulting their cop dev team or their CVC team would also be LPS in certain VC firms like, say, Bloom, for example, would have Cisco ventures as one of their LPs. Is that something that you also do actively, or do you only particularly look at direct investments into startups? So
Speaker 3
1:00:15
we don't that. We don't do that in the US. We feel we have quite a strong presence here and hence, and a very strong team as well. But we have made an investment in our fund in Brazil, and are sort of entering into a new geography in terms of venture investing. We may adopt that strategy, but I don't think we do that in us or India or China, where we already have, as a corporate or as a venture fund, a strong presence,
1:00:45
makes sense. Makes sense.
Speaker 7
1:00:49
Got it? Should we, like shift gears to just understanding a little bit about Priyesh role for them, like just in terms of flexible and things like that. And then I think we'll just leave a couple of minutes just to also record some part of it. Yeah. Okay, so Priyesh, I mean, you know, you recently went through the recruitment cycle. I'm sure that was fun. Talk a little bit about, like, just what, like, if somebody wants to get into, you know, a role like this one, what? What are the skills, what are the experiences that you know the company?
1:01:31
And what do you think worked, particularly in your paper? Yeah, sure,
Speaker 3
1:01:35
Speaker 7
1:04:01
that's that's crazy, though it sounds like, what I find the craziest is the fact that they like I get the network can come in handy, but it makes recruiting for international students just way more difficult. So, yeah,
Speaker 3
1:04:17
I agree, and but you cannot blame them for that. That's how the game works, in a sense, if you understand that it's easier, for that matter, but yeah, I agree with what you're saying,
1:04:27
1:04:30
And I think it's also
Speaker 8
1:04:34
that it also works similarly with, like corporate venture capital, because usually, if you go to some of these, if you, if you follow certain, like, big sourcing areas, like it's safe, maybe YC, or whatever, whatever gets featured on Tech Crunch, since you're doing, say, investments, I feel like you wouldn't have, like, 18 months, like 12 to 24 months of Head Start, of already looking into some companies before they Come to a series a stage where you can invest in them, which means that they already have some PR, which means you already have some face time. But it's interesting to know that you still need to build your network, which is tap into like as early stage as possible, no pools of people who are working on interesting things. Yeah. That's, I think, a very interesting perspective, yeah,
Speaker 3
1:05:22
and I think that's slightly confusing, because getting to know a company is one thing, but there, there you, if you are in the venture world, you are kind of too broad a bucket of companies that are operating. One set of companies are seeking funds, and there are one set of companies in which people want to put that check in, and then they are the ones who decide who they want to get on the cap table. So the networking part of it also comes into play when you have an established brand presence, and you as an investor can say that I will add this specifically, can stack, take my check versus someone else's cool.
Speaker 7
1:06:08
I know we're nearing the end of our call time, so Priyesh, I'm thinking and Gautam, just feel free to add a modified thinking. Maybe he can talk about the two things that he already spoke about which was, one was just what, like, what key strategic objectives drive your CF, CDC, investments at Qualcomm, culture, and the second little bit about, like, how to get into
1:06:37
which we, you know, just spoke about, what do you think,
1:06:40
Yeah, makes sense.
1:06:44
Awesome. Do you mind if I start Sure? Yeah, you can go ahead.
Speaker 7
1:06:50
Cool. Start with, you know, the first one would love to just know a little bit about what strategic objectives drive your investments at Qualcomm ventures, and then we'll, you know, move on to the next question.
Speaker 3
1:07:03
Sure. So acquaintance, we operate broadly as a financial fund, but we do take a look at if there are any strategic synergies with the broader Qualcomm strategy. In that sense, we evaluate whether the company would either be m and a prospect down the line, if they can co brand and sell their services with some of our current offerings, or if they can either serve Qualcomm as a customer or downstream serve some of our some of Qualcomm's customers as customer and Qualcomm and add those are Some place that we look at our mandates again, follow broadly Qualcomm strategy around compute and connectivity and hence all the stream areas which are enabled with that broader thesis is something that we look at
Speaker 7
1:07:54
Awesome. Thank you for sharing. And can you also tell us a little bit more about just what it takes for somebody to get into the job that you're currently in. So any tips and strategies to get into a corporate venture capital role, and particularly at Qualcomm ventures,
Speaker 3
1:08:14
sure. So I think there are two parts of it. There is the corporate part of it and the venture capital part of it, I would say targeting the venture capital part is pretty straight forward. One should have a good network so that they can tap into the right deal flow. One should understand which are the right metrics, right evaluation criteria to understand which companies they should be investing it in, and hence, competitive analysis, understanding how sales metrics happen and and then eventually creating those value in comparable would come in handy from a corporate venture fund perspective. I think what changes is really understanding whether, how do you strategize some of your investments, and bring those strategies back to the corporate fund. So at Qualcomm ventures, we take a look at a lot of companies which can broadly fit in our thesis, and we try to enable those business partnerships. Understanding what a particular fund or a particular corporate focus is and how they are trying to and what they're trying to achieve with their corporate fund would be interesting. Awesome. Sharing. I'm
Speaker 5
1:09:27
going to stop recording. Okay,
1:09:36
awesome, great.
1:09:38
1:09:44
No, I don't have anything else.
Speaker 7
1:09:45
1:10:01
Speaker 7
1:10:05
1:10:13
Okay, and see around. Bye.
How accurate was this transcription?
