S Speaker 22:09as well. Yeah, for sure. Just give you a heads up. Priyesh, we've already have three internships on the table. What do you understand a bit more about Qualcomm. What type of stuff do you guys do? Are you guys more of like a follow on fund, or more of a lead investor, I am closing this round this Friday, or maybe maximum by next Monday, because we still have a few interests. But I don't know if the timeline makes sense, because I know you guys are like COVID Ventures, I don't know. You know, how does it work? Etc.

S Speaker 12:34Yeah, I think, I think you've asked all the right questions, Bobby, because for us, the timeline is a little bit more extended. We have to include our compliance and legal teams and do a lot of song and dance, so it takes about four weeks for us. So I guess we won't be able to match this timeline, though. But always great to be introduced, happy to chat today, and then, you

S Speaker 22:55know, it's always good to make a connection, maybe for the future, but yeah, maybe I'll just start with some intro myself, and then we can just wrap it up, because I still have a lot of things you know, to be working on. Sure you two have the same thing, but yeah, just on a high level, you know, Bobby, founder and CEO at agency AI, we're building cursor for advertisers, the first, you know, autonomous agent take operating system for performance advertisement. So basically, we're turning strategic planning, multimodal content generation and placement as PD, you know, attribution optimization, or through our agent, multi agent system. And then, you know, we're replacing the agencies, which is essentially a $400 billion market. We started market has June 2024, and grew to 5.3 million. Arr, in just the past 10 months.

S Speaker 13:40Yeah, that's amazing. That's pretty amazing. And Bobby, this is space I've been tracking quite a lot. So there's a company called sortment, and they're starting out of India. They're trying to build something that you already have. Seems like your product is really working well with the AR attraction. So that's great to know. What is it called. Again, it's called sortment, s, o r t, m e n t, o r t, m e n t, or maybe I'll just drop a message here, yes, please. So pretty interesting space, for sure. Do you have a white paper on the technology or the backend that you use something that I would love to read through it and sort of just educate myself?

S Speaker 24:16We have the landing page or technical architecture if you want to look into that. But we

S Speaker 14:21don't have one paper. Got it, got it? Yeah, I would love to do that sometime. And then, just as a follow up, maybe I can introduce the fund. We are the COVID venture firm of Qualcomm. Have quite a few investments in the AI stack. Apart from that, we look at mobile technologies, IoT, industry automation, configuration, but particularly for the area that we operate in, we have investments in and property as a foundation model company, hugging face scale, AI weights, and I see solar company in the foundation model infrastructure. And then we have recently started making more investments in the application layer. So a couple of 10 company that we have had recently, and then that's where I wanted to have a chat with that agency, because it's a space we've been tracking. Another company called fiber, which does not do the same thing, but probably would come after the workflow that you guys are doing. So pretty interesting space. Would love to sort of also have a chart down the line when you are raising the next round in the standard timeline. Might not work this way, but then if you if you have a sales flow or something, I would love to review that as well. Probably float it around Qualcomm and see if there is any need for us internally as well for a technology like this, that could be a great partnership.

You know, is there a way for us to be positioned as a positive performance team? So I can just do a quick demo department, and then we can see if there's something you might find useful.

Our checks are typically two, $15 million and we come at around series A or B to series A to pre IQ, I would say. So there's still opportunity for us to partner down the line, I guess, of course, but great, great connecting to devolving. And that's a lot of the time. I understand you have lot of things going on, so for sure, I won't take a lot of time, but we'd love to sort of follow up sometime, a few months down the line doesn't learn myself about the product, and then we can see if there are any potential partnership opportunities.
