S Speaker 26:13We had an internal discussion, and then after that, really, there's a few things I'd love to get your perspective on and some of it done offline. So which is, as you go into this like we're trying to figure out, okay, what, what types of companies in the market will level certain level would want certain level of abstraction from as they build AI, that's great. And then I did some more digging, and then I talked to a bunch of CIOs,

S Speaker 26:55figured out what they want. They essentially said number one thing we want is accuracy for a solution.

Number two thing that we want is
S Speaker 27:07scalability. I mean, it's actually number one. So their biggest concern at large enterprises has been that many startups that they've started working with have had challenges with scalability and and then, and then the accuracy levels, and then everything else. They're like,
scalability. I mean, it's actually number one. So their biggest concern at large enterprises has been that many startups that they've started working with have had challenges with scalability and and then, and then the accuracy levels, and then everything else. They're like,

S Speaker 17:31I don't chew glass. Yeah, I'll figure it out. Yeah. And
I don't chew glass. Yeah, I'll figure it out. Yeah. And
I don't chew glass. Yeah, I'll figure it out. Yeah. And
I don't chew glass. Yeah, I'll figure it out. Yeah. And
S Speaker 27:36that's a problem that somebody else will solve. And it's if somebody offers Okay, I need to spend such and such time. I need to allocate such and such engineers to work on them using an agentic, horizontal, agentic platform that it doesn't it's fine, but it needs to be doable in the time frame that we want it to be right. So how do you like, how are you right now, I would like to understand your customer. Like, is it mid market, up market, and I think we talked about it a little bit, but that was mostly the size of the customer. I think there was a spread. I remember you mentioned. But are you targeting up market, mid market, and then what do you do in order to like, for example, as you go and build the platform? The challenge is that you would have lots of different types of use cases. Then how do you validate like accuracy across all of these, right? Like, I can understand, right? But as a CIO, that's what I want to do, right? Make sure that, yeah, the people that I service are not going to be happy.
that's a problem that somebody else will solve. And it's if somebody offers Okay, I need to spend such and such time.

S Speaker 38:50I think the interesting part on the accuracy, though, is, like I want to mention, is accuracy struggling right now across AI, right? It's not on general knowledge, right, because there's enough training data for that, it tends to be on specialized knowledge, where the accuracy struggles, right? He struggles to know Qualcomm specifically, not the industry abroad. Yeah, I think that's where we are sitting, really seated, really well, and why people are coming to us to say, I gotta solve my data challenges first, in some cases, because that way that specialized data is structured, the way that's accessible and available to agents matters, because that's how, by progressively giving that information to the agent, you eliminate, you eliminate the majority of hallucinations, right? A lot of the hallucinations that we see, at least the market working customers, is massive context, windows, massive rag of I was told you to put all of my data in, and what happens is, the agent, the model, is synthesizing that data to try to make sense of it, fit it into working memory. And that synthesis is actually where the hallucination happens, right? It's trying to compare that. And so it forgets what was real, what was handed to it, what was imagined. But when you change that, the operating model of that to say, feed the model a question, let it go incrementally, retrieve the right specific morsels of data from the overall specialized data store. Those hallucination problems go away. The vast majority of that goes away because it's working with the right facts at the right time and it's not overloaded. Yeah, what
I think the interesting part on the accuracy, though, is, like I want to mention, is accuracy struggling right now across AI, right?

S Speaker 210:19you're saying is rag essentially on and then fine, right? So, very
you're saying is rag essentially on and then fine, right? So, very
you're saying is rag essentially on and then fine, right? So, very
you're saying is rag essentially on and then fine, right? So, very
S Speaker 310:24different, actually. So rag was kind of that first phase of like, push all the context in in one big blob. What we're doing instead is incrementally exposing slices of that data through tools, through MCP tools, on top of a graph. It's an agent can pick up just that one needle in the haystack, not the whole haystack, and try to figure out where the needle is in memory. And that's
different, actually. So rag was kind of that first phase of like, push all the context in in one big blob. What we're doing instead is incrementally exposing slices of that data through tools, through MCP tools, on top of a graph. It's an agent can pick up just that one needle in the haystack, not the whole haystack, and try to figure out where the needle is in memory. And that's

S Speaker 211:54and then for and so right now, as customers are they like, what are the top use cases today?
and then for and so right now, as customers are they like, what are the top use cases today?
and then for and so right now, as customers are they like, what are the top use cases today?
and then for and so right now, as customers are they like, what are the top use cases today?
S Speaker 112:07Yeah, and so again, broadly, we're in the era of what I'll call, like, margin expansion. When I talk to a CIO, like, that's the thing we're talking about with them, but like, Hey, you want to grow 30% this year, and you want headcount to grow 2% are we going to do that? And so very often we're going to, like, the growth oriented Buse, we're saying, like, how are we going to augment R and D? Okay, and again, like, the key thing that we're coming in talking about is, like, we're augmenting R and D. We're not doing the wholesale agent replacement piece. Because I think that's, I think that's where you get into these, like, scalability and accuracy issues. If I'm sitting there saying, like, again, I think Qualcomm's when I've been talking about you guys a ton this week, like, where we talked about these vertical agents, and Qualcomm should absolutely buy Harvey for for legal, they should absolutely buy Sierra for support. But when it comes to their core IP the things that they make them truly great in terms of chip design and actually design these supply chain processes, that's not software they're going to go buy off the shelf. And how do you get the knowledge out of someone who's designed chips for 25 years? You know the nuances like, Oh, hey, you know, we know that when we're using this tab, it's this, is this thing, like, those are the use cases we try and go in and lean in with a lot of these CIOs say, hey, like, let's just, like, make it such that you can just like, creep up. You know, the productivity of your core R and D assets, 15, 20% a lot of it is like this. You start with dumb stuff. You start with, like, personal assistants and swivel chairs and knowledge retrieval and like, again, if data science has taught me anything, you know, the magnet comes from, how do you like, collate across many different systems? Like, how do I solve that problem? For that, you know, the analyst who's doing it, for example, we were talking to the Apple team for data science. We there's like, essentially battery prediction, where he runs the team that basically like they predict, predict like performance of batteries. And these run a bunch of models on whether or not like a given setup is going to work based on like the input chips. So he goes like 15 different systems and 15 different teams to try and run those reports. It's building a high promote agent to do that collation for me. And I review the report. I'm not worried about the accuracy. I have an intuition for what works and what doesn't. And then over time, essentially this is where, like, not Brian stuff, whether it's talking about like this, like knowledge capture every time min goes through those loops, we capture how men retrieves that information. We then save that and then we go tell an agent to go do essentially that work autonomously. We've hardwired in the pathway, like this is how we think. As an apple machine learning engineer who worries about batteries and, like, you can't, you can't get trained your way into that, you have to, like, have the agent observe the work. And so that's, that's those little use case we go after. So yeah, lots of swivel chair reduction, lots of multi system aggregation and collation. Again, lots of like, silly workflows that are just eating up a bunch of time and again. Like, the conversation we keep on CIOs is like, Okay, that's great, being that, you know, four hours that we're saving a week per, you know, I don't tell you a battery so much per battery analyst, that's great. You know, that's that across 40 analysts, we've saved you three heads. Cool. That's how you're moving against this. Like we keep growing, we experience the margin expansion without the head cat list, okay,
Yeah, and so again, broadly, we're in the era of what I'll call, like, margin expansion. When I talk to a CIO, like, that's the thing we're talking about with them, but like, Hey, you want to grow 30% this year, and you want headcount to grow 2% are we going to do that?

Like, the conversation we keep on CIOs is like, Okay, that's great, being that, you know, four hours that we're saving a week per, you know, I don't tell you a battery so much per battery analyst, that's great. You know, that's that across 40 analysts, we've saved you three heads. Cool. That's how you're moving against this. Like we keep growing, we experience the margin expansion without the head cat list, okay,

S Speaker 115:54like, the use cases are, like, pretty like, we're like, this is, again, like the magic of hyper mode, like, g2 is a good one that I'll mention there, like, we're experiencing a lot of sprawl. So like, Oh, hey. Like the I can tell you what BU's are using it. And like, hey, generally speaking, the sales team, for example, or g2 is, like, trying to automate the essentially, opportunity creations and, like, opportunity update management. But in that bucket there's, you know, 900 different, you know, workflows and use cases and all sorts of junk. But so when you see this, I'm not being intentionally vague. It's just like, you know, what are all the different ways you can use a screwdriver? It's like, yeah, you can do all sorts of fun things. But I'll go and add that as a note for my for follow up for me, yeah, and

S Speaker 117:50And I think to maybe even, like, underline that point. Like, we're a team of distributed system engineers where we built a database that scales to like, trillions of records. And so, like, when we're looking at this problem that's like the high water mark we're approaching from. And so, you know, we like scalability. We like high levels of concurrency. We like real time workloads.

S Speaker 118:43some we provide both options. So for example, if Qualcomm has their own models that they've built, if you host them yourself, great, you can just, you can wire them and be accurate. So that's what I'm saying. And so there's also, we host all the open source models. So if you want to use deep seek and all this. I'm like, we won't rate limit, even scale. And then the last piece is, a lot of these companies, they aggregate across the model providers where, like, Qualcomm is going to be in the same bucket with all 10,000 other customers that I have. What you guys can do, especially at the enterprise scale, we often say, bring your own key. Like, yes, I'd love to make money off of hosting your like, proxying your open AI usage. But like, go sign your enterprise usage with open AI with anthropic. Bring that model to essentially hyper mode, and then you will have the scalability of a company from that enterprise agreement with them. Like, we again, I love getting margin off that. But we understand the same thing, of like, at enterprise scale, like you guys probably have better pricing power than we do, or you can go and get, you know, a, you know, a big discount on, on, you know, 100 billion tokens.

S Speaker 319:53the other challenge I'm hearing, too, is like, Oh, if Qualcomm working with anthropic, anthropic, they just say we don't have enough capacity for you right now? Yeah, right. At times, it's not that. It's

The guys, the person that's whose job is to respond is, is for customers, he's not going to go negotiate, yeah, yeah, right, like he's saying, Give me a solution that does it for can Qualcomm get a better pricing and can Qualcomm do all Yeah. But initially, as you know, a lot of this is experimentation.

HPE is signing hopefully in July, to answer your question, the revenue breakdown is 7030, enterprise, true, enterprise companies with 1000s of employees, like large cap, but by customer count, right?

Oh, the in the self serve, you have
Oh, the in the self serve, you have
Oh, the in the self serve, you have
S Speaker 122:51large enterprise customers. No self serve is all done through a sales team. Like, again, like, like, folks will show up and like, sometimes they'll get, like, someone from Apple or HP will come and swipe a credit card, but we don't like, that's not, that's not a customer. That's that's one guy at a company who like, and so like, when we started to be, like, really specific. So by revenue breakdown of like, what percentage of our revenue comes from large cap enterprise, 70 plus percent. When you look at the total customer count, the that ratio is inverted. We have lots of very small customers. And we have, you know, 10 enterprises paying lots of
large enterprise customers. No self serve is all done through a sales team.

Those are some of our largest ones signing, hopefully in the next couple of days, IBM is going to be another big one, north of 160k a year. K a year. We have five year or three year deal with a two year option on it, TCV, north of a million which is, which will be cool, ZS and Associates, you know, fortune, global, 2000 pharmaceutical consulting firm. I think those will be and then 12. Digital, it's another public company. They're currently paying, like, a couple 1000 bucks, but we're supposed to ratchet to north of 60k a year, hopefully very soon. Like, those are kind of, I think the interesting logos, and they'll be like, G to i There's small firm doing, you know, 10 million bucks a year is this. They're the size of their business. They're small, but they pay enterprise skew.
