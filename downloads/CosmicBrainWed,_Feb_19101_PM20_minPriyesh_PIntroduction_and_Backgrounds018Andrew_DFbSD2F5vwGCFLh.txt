S Speaker 11:28Okay. So Andrew, originally from India, did my undergrad from IIT Madras, spent about four years in India prior post that working with a lot of startups, I joined an early stage clean tech startup back in India, saw it sort of grow till unicorn and round. Now they're raising like they're doing an IPO. So that was a great experience, but a little bit slow, and I realized, personally, I would like to be involved with a lot of startups at the same time. So wanted to pivot into venture, moved to the US. Did my MBA from UCLA, worked with a lot of venture funds, spent a year or so with more fears, which is an LA based fund enterprise SaaS, and then spent about six months with Menlo Ventures, and then I've been with Qualcomm for the last one year, mostly focused on AI investments we have and jumping Ships. Maybe about the fund. We have been around for 25 plus years now, deployed about two and a half billion dollars in capital. It's a global fund. So we have offices in India, us, Latin America, China, Israel and UK. And typically, we aim to deploy about 150 $280 million a year in us. Check sizes would be anywhere between two to $15 million preferably five to seven, if we can get allocation for that. We are typically a Series A plus investor, but we do see opportunistically for some strong team back AI startups, given the valuations are all high at the moment. And then, apart from Ai, we invest in robotics, IoT, industrial automation, automobile tech stack, ar, VR and a lot of other parallel spaces to Qualcomm, if you see an angle of compute or connectivity, that's where we play. And from a Qualcomm perspective, we partner with our companies quite closely. So a lot of our companies act as customers of Qualcomm go to market partners with some of our mobile PCs. Like we ship a lot of compute chips across multiple platforms, from PCs to mobiles to cloud inference as well, which is a new sort of vertical for us. And then we partner with a lot of our companies, sort of trying to enable them natively on some of these platforms, connecting them to some of our DTM partners, or, in fact, down the line, maybe even an M A target with Qualcomm. So that's how sort that's a like, brief background, any pointed questions that I can answer? Awesome.

S Speaker 17:25So that's a very interesting overview. Get a lot of that sense you mentioned. Mused is, how's that pronounced? I'd love to take a look. Got it? Got it? I'd love to take a look down the line after the call. That's very interesting. So ten million you you already have turn sheets. How are you planning to fit like, sort of capital for the round? Do you see spaces for strategic investors at this moment?

S Speaker 18:28Got it. Yeah, got it. And from the product perspective, you mentioned robotic simulations. Are you actually creating World Foundation models? A lot of people try to sort of call it physical AI models. And we have spent some time there as a team, we have taken a look at a few companies in that space. So are you models for world applications, or do you plan to create more constrained environment? Models for, let's say, industrial automation, for robotics, things like that? Yeah.

S Speaker 28:56So when, when we were in music, what we used to do is like nerf models. So nerf was like a technology that a lot of people use even water labs, you know, make them text to simulations, text to gaming and stuff. But there's a lot of limitations in building World Foundation models with nerf. And even right now, I don't think you can build entire game engines or intractable environments just from division models as well, right? Yeah. So that we saw, okay, there's an opportunity. There's a couple of research, but that's probably the last one from one is called cosmos and and we have, like, Genesis. We have, like, working on a crossroads research that recently came out, bringing it together, and I'm building our own model as well. So for we saw an opportunity, okay, this is actually very good to build simulations for a particular process, right? And training for robots, right? It cannot create, like, a huge game engine, or like walk walk throughs and all that. But this is possible as a journey. But eventually, when the models will get good enough, and the research will get good enough, probably, like in two years, it can be a generalist COVID Foundation model, which can create any sort of stuff, right? So, but that is yet to come. That will happen. I don't know how the rest of the companies are managing. I know policy is there. They're trying to, kind of like, scan the whole world. World labs have their own data sets. We don't believe that's immediately possible. I don't know how long they'll stay in the research space for, but what we are looking for is immediate employment and make this possible. And we are the stages. Are tuning the research papers. So we are kind of like fine tuning a model we have, like a model that's trained on, like, 10 million hours of industrial data for robotics. So we are fine tuning that model for the next six months and deploy it to the first customers in five to six months and then build our own models. So we are also talking to and couple like Nvidia superbusters, who we like, we're trying to make a deal with. So we initially thought of like going within Nvidia, but MD is like, hey, kind of take up our superbusters. We'll give it up, give it to you for free to build a model and stuff. So we kind of like that way. Yeah, interesting.

So we kind of like that way. Yeah, interesting.
S Speaker 111:03So that's that's interesting. And a lot of these companies we have spoken to take will take a lot of time to commercialize it. So I understand that you mentioned initially you plan to fine tune some of the models for few industrial applications. Can you expand a little bit on that? What are the data sets you're using? What would be some of these industrial applications, would it be like or about that?
So that's that's interesting. And a lot of these companies we have spoken to take will take a lot of time to commercialize it. So I understand that you mentioned initially you plan to fine tune some of the models for few industrial applications. Can you expand a little bit on that? What are the data sets you're using?

What would be some of these industrial applications, would it be like or about that?
S Speaker 211:32Okay, yeah, sorry, I got stuck. Can you hear me? Good? Yes. Okay, perfect, yeah. So initially, we are already talking to a couple of CSUSB companies, which is doing, like, making humanoid robots. So we have, like, figure AI foundation robotics, couple of robots who are like, kind of like going to mass manufacturing in the next few years, right? So the task that they do is like, kind of like, you know, doing everyday tasks like cooking, cleaning, sweeping the floor. In the hospitality industry, kind of like changing different stuff, picking up objects, placing it in the racks, those kind of stuff, right? So what we're doing create a digital twin of the robots that they're deploying, and we create an environment for them to create it on, right? So it can be like for the, you know, robots, if they want to create it on a factory floor, we create the entire simulation for a factory floor. If it's like a home environment, we create a simulation of the home environment, and it can simulate different scenarios in its head. So based on the text problem that it gives, it, can simulate, like, probably 100 different ways of picking up an object, cleaning of different faces, how to hold the stick in the hand, or how to, like, lift up objects. We have a really good physics model for it, physics engine for it as well. So that's the one of the applications. The second applications is, so we are all talking to GM, so they have probably 100 million hours of like camera, like media data from all their factories. So we create like entire warehouse simulations where different robots can interact with each other, right? So there are like robots in the warehouses which are like picking objects from different racks, kind of like placing it in different places, interacting with different like, you know, where belts and all that, right? So we create an entire simulation where different robots, AI robots, can interact with each other and learn from each other. So it can probably improve the efficiency, probably by 10 to 25% by this process, and the next wave of robots that they launched can be trained in very short period of time. Got
Okay, yeah, sorry, I got stuck. Can you hear me? Good? Yes. Okay, perfect, yeah. So initially, we are already talking to a couple of CSUSB companies, which is doing, like, making humanoid robots.

So it can probably improve the efficiency, probably by 10 to 25% by this process, and the next wave of robots that they launched can be trained in very short period of time. Got
Okay, yeah, sorry, I got stuck. Can you hear me? Good? Yes. Okay, perfect, yeah. So initially, we are already talking to a couple of CSUSB companies, which is doing, like, making humanoid robots. So we have, like, figure AI foundation robotics, couple of robots who are like, kind of like going to mass manufacturing in the next few years, right? So the task that they do is like, kind of like, you know, doing everyday tasks like cooking, cleaning, sweeping the floor. In the hospitality industry, kind of like changing different stuff, picking up objects, placing it in the racks, those kind of stuff, right? So what we're doing create a digital twin of the robots that they're deploying, and we create an environment for them to create it on, right? So it can be like for the, you know, robots, if they want to create it on a factory floor, we create the entire simulation for a factory floor. If it's like a home environment, we create a simulation of the home environment, and it can simulate different scenarios in its head. So based on the text problem that it gives, it, can simulate, like, probably 100 different ways of picking up an object, cleaning of different faces, how to hold the stick in the hand, or how to, like, lift up objects. We have a really good physics model for it, physics engine for it as well. So that's the one of the applications. The second applications is, so we are all talking to GM, so they have probably 100 million hours of like camera, like media data from all their factories. So we create like entire warehouse simulations where different robots can interact with each other, right? So there are like robots in the warehouses which are like picking objects from different racks, kind of like placing it in different places, interacting with different like, you know, where belts and all that, right?

S Speaker 213:39Yeah. So it's industrial PCs. So industrial PCs are the main integrators between manufacturers and the factory force, right? So there's probably five to six major companies like Rockwell, axiom and a couple of others who are like in the forefront of it, right? And for the first time in the in 50 years, that including GPUs in their computers, right? So they are like, betting on the future of AI and simulations into building robots as well, right? So if we kind of like track these clients, they have access to almost throughout all industries around the world, right? So it's like going in water funnel, going at the top, and they our products will be distributed through that right through all their robust manufacturers. So that's what we have as well.
Yeah. So it's industrial PCs. So industrial PCs are the main integrators between manufacturers and the factory force, right?

I don't know if you have been there, yeah, perfect,
I don't know if you have been there, yeah, perfect,
S Speaker 214:49yeah. So, like, yeah, we used to have it hacked together, build products together. They're like, oh, like, they want to, like, quit Google. They're not like, they're like, they want to work on something that's a moonshot idea, or kind of the next big thing, right? So they are really believing in something like this, with the job at Google to kind of pursue this, so we all came together to work on it. Yes,
yeah. So, like, yeah, we used to have it hacked together, build products together. They're like, oh, like, they want to, like, quit Google.

So they are really believing in something like this, with the job at Google to kind of pursue this, so we all came together to work on it. Yes,
S Speaker 115:10interesting. And one question on the product and tech, and so a lot of companies used to use nerf previously to create 3d simulations and caution splatting is the new technology, and there are multiple startups trying to use questions to you create 3d technology, 3d simulations for different vertical applications. How do you see this to be fundamentally different from a lot of those players?
interesting. And one question on the product and tech, and so a lot of companies used to use nerf previously to create 3d simulations and caution splatting is the new technology, and there are multiple startups trying to use questions to you create 3d technology, 3d simulations for different vertical applications.

How do you see this to be fundamentally different from a lot of those players?
S Speaker 215:34Yes. So it's there are multiple ways to look at it, or multiple steps to it right? The first thing starts with a very good data set. So data set is kind of the key. Who worked at Google, he kind of like went with like building on YouTube in the initial phase, so they have access to all the major industries in the world, like in go to Asia, Middle East, Europe and all that. So we are meeting making strategic partnership with different manufacturers to leverage their accurate industrial data sets, right? So most of the companies right now are dealing with this use generalized data, probably YouTube data or like come to like, free source media, something right. Problem by creating those kind of, like creating a model from those videos is that it's kind of like, less precise and does not have that much quality to actually be implemented in a robotics platform. So in order to create a robot, you need to be very precise, you need to have a high quality data set or high quality model, and that's only possible with a strategic partnership with the data providers, right? We are doing that. That's number one, that makes us different, right? Secondly, there's also different things when it comes to video labeling. So we have a process where we break down, like different, like huge amounts, break it down into like, small pieces, small chunks, and label the high quality data to be fed back into the diffusion models. So it's a unique way that we're approaching it. And the third is a physics model, right? So if physics model should be combined on top of this to actually be, to actually enable the digital twin of the robot to interact with environments and see the what the pressure applied on each objects, how the object has to move, how the arm has to move, how the legs has to move, like everything has to be on a physical environment. Yeah. So these three things definitely may get a huge improvement. And there are a couple of other IPs that we are working on as a
Yes. So it's there are multiple ways to look at it, or multiple steps to it right? The first thing starts with a very good data set. So data set is kind of the key.

S Speaker 217:41yeah. So for, yeah, for the data sets, we are talking a couple of people. I cannot read all the names, but one of the major player is General Motors. We are trying to, you know, kind of, like, clear the kind of, like, the privacy data, like, we are trying to, like, sign up Lois and agreements with them so that we can disclose the names as passive today, but yeah, we're working with the major players, and GM is one of them. So who we can talk about and yeah, and for the labeling, we are talking with Sapien. So sapien is a data labeling company, who they're also investing in our company as well, right? So they're one of the initial lead investors, so they have a data labeling company, and they will partner up with this forum those kind of mass labeling and stuff Understood,

S Speaker 119:17okay, let me get back to you on that. Do you have a more detailed memo that you're preparing more on the product and tech side? Is this just for our internal references on how we're thinking about the data ingestion model, how we're thinking about building the model? What sort of different data layers you have? What would be your commercial realization pipeline, initial design partners, things like that. Do you have something like that collated all together so that we can use that internally for our reference discussions?

S Speaker 119:57sounds good. And also, let me get back. Let me set up a meeting with Tushar. Tushar is our Managing Director for us investments. He also works with me on our AI investment strategy. So Tushar has been with Qualcomm for the last 20 years or so, so he has good partnerships internally, and from a strategic perspective, he would be the best person to sort of also see where we can add value. So that would be a good follow up conversation to have, and then maybe following up from that, maybe broader management discussion. But I'd like to have this discussion scheduled initially, and then I'll get back to you, probably by end of the day on his schedule, and then we can work together. Perfect. Thank you so much Absolutely, man. Great. Catching up.
