S Speaker 11:17So I'll give you a quick introduction for us and and now tell you some context, and would love to learn more about you and what you're building now. So my background is also in software engineering and product management, cameras, computer vision. Background, I actually worked on conversational voices as well long time ago,

S Speaker 11:54and we invest. So, for example, for for the last seven, eight years, I've been investing with Qualcomm and ventures. And so my focus, a large part of my focus, is AI and so Qualcomm Ventures has been around for about 25 years. We invest in areas that are strategically relevant to Qualcomm. So the areas are strategically relevant to Qualcomm happen to be many. So there's mobile, there's IoT, there's networking, and there's automotive and PCs and even cloud. So we make platforms that go into all of these different devices and cloud, and then almost all of them these days have aI accelerators, and so we're working with many companies to actually put AI workloads on device, or whether it's latency requirements, whether it's cost requirements or

S Speaker 13:29We now retail. So there's, I mean, I'll jump to the context a little bit. So one of the things that we're doing, so there's a few things happening on mobile and PCs. So PCs, we think that the future of PCS is going to be on and which is, you've seen this transition happen from the max on, from x86 to to arm, and then PCs haven't caught up yet, but now we've got the product. This was our first year with that product, and essentially the response is really, really good. So we're selling a lot of these PCs that have 40 tops of AI performance on device. And so we sell to many, many corporates, companies, call centers, all these different types of enterprises. And then a lot of them, they actually want some of these workloads to start running on device, whether it's for privacy reasons, whether it's for cost reasons, whether it's for latency reasons. And then conversational voice, you are voice AI is one of the use case that's like, it's like, one of the top use cases that everybody's asking for on device. And then so and then, similarly, even on mobile, you could like, there's a mobile component to this as well, where on mobile devices, we will see our use cases to run one device. So we've been scanning for companies in the space, and that's how I stumbled upon retail AI and and figured I should reach out to you. So that's the background.

S Speaker 15:38I mean, when we invest in a company, I'm guessing, so you guys are still early stage, right? Yes. And so when we invest in, oh, yeah, maybe I'll provide a little more context, which is so the way we invest in companies is we don't invest in companies such that they have a product on device or product that works with Qualcomm hardware. Now we understand that in early stages of the company, many times it'll take them a year or two years to actually get there, and if at all, that's not a requirement. But the idea is that what's happening in that space, and then we will get you exposed to many go to market, channel partners in that space, and if you feel the need down the road, and if you see an opportunity big enough to actually port on device, then sure that's port on device. There's been many cases where, like, I'll tell you we invested. We were serious. Like early, very early. This was like when zoom was called SaaS B, it wasn't even called Zoom. So when we invested in zoom, the idea was that we will work with Zoom to it because for G, video conferencing on phones was like the number one killer use case for G, right? And then it wasn't up until, like, a few years later than we when we actually started working. But the idea was to actually have to talk so, so that's the, I mean, you don't necessarily need to have, like, an on device product

S Speaker 27:18understood got, yep, that makes a lot of sense. Awesome, awesome,
understood got, yep, that makes a lot of sense. Awesome, awesome,
understood got, yep, that makes a lot of sense. Awesome, awesome,
understood got, yep, that makes a lot of sense. Awesome, awesome,
7:23cool. I can give a quick overview of
cool. I can give a quick overview of

cool. I can give a quick overview of
7:25what we're doing here,
what we're doing here,
what we're doing here,
what we're doing here,
S Speaker 18:35And so are you building like a platform to manage these agents, or are you also building these agents? We're
And so are you building like a platform to manage these agents, or are you also building these agents? We're
And so are you building like a platform to manage these agents, or are you also building these agents? We're
And so are you building like a platform to manage these agents, or are you also building these agents? We're
S Speaker 28:42building these agents, and then you can manage them directly. Yeah, okay.
building these agents, and then you can manage them directly. Yeah, okay.
building these agents, and then you can manage them directly. Yeah, okay.
building these agents, and then you can manage them directly. Yeah, okay.
S Speaker 18:49I'm curious again, the reliability of the technology for the types of use cases that you're targeting with AI voice AI agents today, yeah,
I'm curious again, the reliability of the technology for the types of use cases that you're targeting with AI voice AI agents today, yeah,
I'm curious again, the reliability of the technology for the types of use cases that you're targeting with AI voice AI agents today, yeah,
I'm curious again, the reliability of the technology for the types of use cases that you're targeting with AI voice AI agents today, yeah,
S Speaker 28:59yeah, reliability, I mean, yeah, there's a couple of aspects there, like, in terms of scaling, I mean, with probably, like 40% 50% month for a month, so there's definitely some scaling issue in there, but we got that mostly covered, excuse me. But in terms of the latency, compositional interaction aspect, we have that cover, so it's very low latency. Turn taking is very accurate, meaning the AI and di knows when to listen and when to talk so that there's an interrupt person. So yeah, that's definitely something that we spend a lot of effort on. Okay,
yeah, reliability, I mean, yeah, there's a couple of aspects there, like, in terms of scaling, I mean, with probably, like 40% 50% month for a month, so there's definitely some scaling issue in there, but we got that mostly covered, excuse me.

Okay,
S Speaker 19:44and so so your customers would be like, would CCAs because companies would be me, your customers? Or would you sell direct, or would you compete with the ccaas companies?
and so so your customers would be like, would CCAs because companies would be me, your customers? Or would you sell direct, or would you compete with the ccaas companies?
and so so your customers would be like, would CCAs because companies would be me, your customers? Or would you sell direct, or would you compete with the ccaas companies?
and so so your customers would be like, would CCAs because companies would be me, your customers? Or would you sell direct, or would you compete with the ccaas companies?
S Speaker 29:57Yeah, good question. So we actually like to go direct to mid market enterprise customers. For example, we have this customers that's a roadside assistant platform, yeah, and they have 150 college agents that are doing calls every day, all day, and they need to call the repair shops and can quote and get an estimate tag, and they need to do a second call to dispatch them. So they have, like, under 50 people doing this all day long, and they use us to replace 50 of them now and and they continue to place more. So we like to go direct to people who are, you know, who need phone calls. But of course, we have some channel partners too that are integrated with us, so that they can bring to their clients as well, like we go.io is CCAP software, and just call it color pilot. So we have these type of partnerships as well.
Yeah, good question. So we actually like to go direct to mid market enterprise customers.

So we have these type of partnerships as well.
S Speaker 110:59And so you like in this, this example for roadside assistance, you mentioned they also call, like, you know, mechanic shops to get coats. Yes, so is your agent actually able to call mechanic shops and actually get coats from them,
And so you like in this, this example for roadside assistance, you mentioned they also call, like, you know, mechanic shops to get coats. Yes, so is your agent actually able to call mechanic shops and actually get coats from them,
And so you like in this, this example for roadside assistance, you mentioned they also call, like, you know, mechanic shops to get coats. Yes, so is your agent actually able to call mechanic shops and actually get coats from them,
And so you like in this, this example for roadside assistance, you mentioned they also call, like, you know, mechanic shops to get coats. Yes, so is your agent actually able to call mechanic shops and actually get coats from them,
S Speaker 211:24exactly. That's it. Yeah, they can do that. You can do they can get code. They can update their system with the code that they get, right? They can send SMS. They can send email, yeah, so it's very complex workflow, which AI can do now,
exactly. That's it. Yeah, they can do that. You can do they can get code. They can update their system with the code that they get, right? They can send SMS. They can send email, yeah, so it's very complex workflow, which AI can do now,
exactly. That's it. Yeah, they can do that. You can do they can get code. They can update their system with the code that they get, right? They can send SMS. They can send email, yeah, so it's very complex workflow, which AI can do now,

S Speaker 111:43and this is you mentioned something about reliability, like 40% month over month, which is what? What was that?
and this is you mentioned something about reliability, like 40% month over month, which is what? What was that?
and this is you mentioned something about reliability, like 40% month over month, which is what? What was that?
and this is you mentioned something about reliability, like 40% month over month, which is what? What was that?
S Speaker 211:52It's our growth in usage. Oh, that's
It's our growth in usage. Oh, that's
It's our growth in usage. Oh, that's
It's our growth in usage. Oh, that's
11:55the usage growth, 40%
the usage growth, 40%
the usage growth, 40%
the usage growth, 40%
S Speaker 111:59month over month. How do you define that usage? Which is usage of the agents, or is it, is it the number of agents?
month over month. How do you define that usage? Which is usage of the agents, or is it, is it the number of agents?
month over month. How do you define that usage? Which is usage of the agents, or is it, is it the number of agents?
month over month. How do you define that usage? Which is usage of the agents, or is it, is it the number of agents?
S Speaker 212:06Yeah, good question is the minutes we charge by minutes, okay,
Yeah, good question is the minutes we charge by minutes, okay,
Yeah, good question is the minutes we charge by minutes, okay,
Yeah, good question is the minutes we charge by minutes, okay,
S Speaker 112:15and, and so. So essentially, people are finding it more and more useful. So they're able to have, they have you deployed with any customers where they've been able to replace humans like actually reduce the cost altogether?
and, and so. So essentially, people are finding it more and more useful. So they're able to have, they have you deployed with any customers where they've been able to replace humans like actually reduce the cost altogether?
and, and so. So essentially, people are finding it more and more useful. So they're able to have, they have you deployed with any customers where they've been able to replace humans like actually reduce the cost altogether?
and, and so. So essentially, people are finding it more and more useful. So they're able to have, they have you deployed with any customers where they've been able to replace humans like actually reduce the cost altogether?
S Speaker 212:29Yes, yes, we have quite a few. There's another healthcare company also, I see what fair square Medicare? Yeah, I think they have a dozen or two dozen receptionists before, but now they come to you. They don't interesting.
Yes, yes, we have quite a few. There's another healthcare company also, I see what fair square Medicare? Yeah, I think they have a dozen or two dozen receptionists before, but now they come to you. They don't interesting.
Yes, yes, we have quite a few. There's another healthcare company also, I see what fair square Medicare? Yeah, I think they have a dozen or two dozen receptionists before, but now they come to you. They don't interesting.

S Speaker 112:48And what type of models do you use today? Are you building your own in house models
And what type of models do you use today? Are you building your own in house models
And what type of models do you use today? Are you building your own in house models
And what type of models do you use today? Are you building your own in house models
S Speaker 212:54or Yeah? So we have our in house models to orchestrate the conversation, right, taking the interactions and all of that, but we do use text to speech model from the market as well, like 11 labs. 11 labs, okay,
or Yeah? So we have our in house models to orchestrate the conversation, right, taking the interactions and all of that, but we do use text to speech model from the market as well, like 11 labs. 11 labs, okay,

would. We haven't. We haven't decided to in a group. I don't think they're any better. I think they're absolutely worse than 11.
13:24Really interesting.
S Speaker 113:27What about latency? Is it? Is it also not better? Because the reason I'm asking is, you know, they're using state space models, and then the idea was that with state space models, you can get a lot more context and much smaller, faster latency. And then your use case latency is important, right?
What about latency? Is it? Is it also not better? Because the reason I'm asking is, you know, they're using state space models, and then the idea was that with state space models, you can get a lot more context and much smaller, faster latency. And then your use case latency is important, right?

S Speaker 213:43Yes, absolutely. So I think their latency is a bit better. It's like 100 milliseconds better, but their voice quality is not as good. Yeah, that's just from customer feedback. Yeah, interesting. But you know, we get the latency down to right, 800 700 milliseconds, which is like very, very low already. So
Yes, absolutely. So I think their latency is a bit better. It's like 100 milliseconds better, but their voice quality is not as good. Yeah, that's just from customer feedback. Yeah, interesting. But you know, we get the latency down to right, 800 700 milliseconds, which is like very, very low already. So
Yes, absolutely. So I think their latency is a bit better. It's like 100 milliseconds better, but their voice quality is not as good. Yeah, that's just from customer feedback. Yeah, interesting.

But you know, we get the latency down to right, 800 700 milliseconds, which is like very, very low already. So
S Speaker 114:06do you want it? I mean, the Holy Grail is where it feels completely real time is less than 200 milliseconds, right? So would you want to get there?
do you want it? I mean, the Holy Grail is where it feels completely real time is less than 200 milliseconds, right? So would you want to get there?
do you want it? I mean, the Holy Grail is where it feels completely real time is less than 200 milliseconds, right? So would you want to get there?
do you want it? I mean, the Holy Grail is where it feels completely real time is less than 200 milliseconds, right? So would you want to get there?
14:17Yes, yes, ideally, yes, yes, right now,
Yes, yes, ideally, yes, yes, right now,
Yes, yes, ideally, yes, yes, right now,
Yes, yes, ideally, yes, yes, right now,
14:22yeah. I think voice quality is also very

And you can't drop packets and all that, right? So
S Speaker 114:35exactly with investor and another company called bail, said, labs, yeah, they're based out of Seattle. I don't I mean, they definitely claim that they've got the best quality voices we've heard from some customers as well, that compared to any other quality of voice, they're the best. I don't know if you've given a shot, but worth trying.

S Speaker 115:58Because, yeah, I guess with, if you truly have you experimented with purely conversational AI yet, I'm guessing you have the question that's the reliability part that I had in mind, which is, which is, can you truly come up with, like, a full end to end conversation flow where you can reliably actually get a code from a dealership or a code from a mechanic shop? Or,
Because, yeah, I guess with, if you truly have you experimented with purely conversational AI yet, I'm guessing you have the question that's the reliability part that I had in mind, which is, which is, can you truly come up with, like, a full end to end conversation flow where you can reliably actually get a code from a dealership or a code from a mechanic shop?

Or,
S Speaker 216:23yeah, yeah, absolutely. So if you want, I can send you a number for you to try out. Yeah, yeah. So this one is not exactly the mechanic shop one, but it's a real estate use case. It's a real use
yeah, yeah, absolutely. So if you want, I can send you a number for you to try out. Yeah, yeah. So this one is not exactly the mechanic shop one, but it's a real estate use case. It's a real use

yeah, we have dialog management.
S Speaker 117:12Okay, you do have dialog management for this one. But do you think at some point you can get rid of dialog management completely? Or no,
Okay, you do have dialog management for this one. But do you think at some point you can get rid of dialog management completely? Or no,
Okay, you do have dialog management for this one. But do you think at some point you can get rid of dialog management completely? Or no,
Okay, you do have dialog management for this one. But do you think at some point you can get rid of dialog management completely? Or no,
S Speaker 217:26it's possible for some use cases, but not others. Like, if it's like healthcare, right? You want things to be rigid, yeah, but if it's like survey, we have people doing political surveys for both parties, actually. And then you want those to be very rigid. But for others, like for sales, I'm pretty sure it will go away. For sales, you want to be
it's possible for some use cases, but not others. Like, if it's like healthcare, right?

17:56you know. So, like,
S Speaker 117:59even though you're not doing on device today, one of the things that we have, like, we're working in, actually, a bunch of ccaas companies or business unites on PC. The advantage of on device, because what happens is these, these call centers, they all buy PCs, right? And call centers are run on PC. They run on Macs, right? So, so they run on PCs, and then there they all want to reduce cost. And then for the ccaas company, well, it's essentially a significant reduction in cost, because your gross margins, I mean, I'm guessing, what? What's your gross margin profile?
even though you're not doing on device today, one of the things that we have, like, we're working in, actually, a bunch of ccaas companies or business unites on PC. The advantage of on device, because what happens is these, these call centers, they all buy PCs, right? And call centers are run on PC. They run on Macs, right?

And then for the ccaas company, well, it's essentially a significant reduction in cost, because your gross margins, I mean, I'm guessing, what? What's your gross margin profile?
18:41How much 40 to 50%
S Speaker 118:44Yeah, so you want to get your gross margin profile to like 75% if possible, right? So, so that's where, like, at scale, we're seeing significant. And this is where I think a lot of people are, and the large part of your cost, I'm guessing, is inference cost,
Yeah, so you want to get your gross margin profile to like 75% if possible, right? So, so that's where, like, at scale, we're seeing significant. And this is where I think a lot of people are, and the large part of your cost, I'm guessing, is inference cost,

S Speaker 219:01yes, yes. Oh, I see. So you're saying like, if you do on device, then cost,
yes, yes. Oh, I see. So you're saying like, if you do on device, then cost,
yes, yes. Oh, I see. So you're saying like, if you do on device, then cost,
yes, yes. Oh, I see. So you're saying like, if you do on device, then cost,
19:09so they'll cover their costs.
so they'll cover their costs.
so they'll cover their costs.
so they'll cover their costs.
S Speaker 119:10No on devices. You use the compute that's available on device.
No on devices. You use the compute that's available on device.
No on devices. You use the compute that's available on device.
No on devices. You use the compute that's available on device.
S Speaker 219:16And I mean, I mean, the cost center will have to buy the hardware side. Yeah, so, so
And I mean, I mean, the cost center will have to buy the hardware side. Yeah, so, so
And I mean, I mean, the cost center will have to buy the hardware side. Yeah, so, so
And I mean, I mean, the cost center will have to buy the hardware side. Yeah, so, so
S Speaker 119:21the call centers are all upgrading to new hardware, the large call centers. So there's, I mean, the market of call centers, as you know, is, like, there's mid market, and then there's up market, up market. In upmarket, there's just a few players that own, like, not few players, but that, like, there's, like, you know, 5060, of these that have huge number of call centers and and for those, they have incentives to actually, so because, so what you do is we do a sell through. So we sell them like all involved, so they start replacing their existing PCs that don't have npus, but newer PCs that have npus. So over the course of the next three to five years, you will start seeing most of these call centers just have enough compute on these PCs as they replace because they come up on their replacement cycles, right? So they're all going to replace PCs with npus, and these npus will have enough compute such that you can actually start running your inference on device, and there's no point of running it one you actually get latency benefits as well. And cost is it pays for you to actually run it on device, because over there, your large part of your Imagine your gross margin profile can go from where it is today to to almost 70% gross margin, right?
the call centers are all upgrading to new hardware, the large call centers. So there's, I mean, the market of call centers, as you know, is, like, there's mid market, and then there's up market, up market.

S Speaker 121:08Yeah. I mean the size of the VR models. I mean, we work with ladle labs, so all these models that the models, even the ones that you use, they can all run on device today. So it's not like technology wise. It's there already. It's just a matter of you, you initially, you, in early stages of the company, have to focus on scale. Yes, in later stages of the company, you can start optimizing for gross margins. So
Yeah. I mean the size of the VR models. I mean, we work with ladle labs, so all these models that the models, even the ones that you use, they can all run on device today.
