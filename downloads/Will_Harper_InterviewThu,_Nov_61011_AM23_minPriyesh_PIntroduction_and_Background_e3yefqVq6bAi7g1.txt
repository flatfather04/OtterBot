S Speaker 10:00Think Leon was shepherding this call, but I think he's dropped off, so I think it's just the two of us now. Yeah, so I'm not sure how familiar you are with wi Harper, but you know if, if you're not familiar, I'm happy to give a give a brief overview, but, but in the interest of time, because we got 19 minutes left, you know, if you would prefer, you know, we could just dive into your your background, and try to utilize the time that we got as much

S Speaker 20:31as possible. Absolutely. Mark, yes, I've done a little bit of research on my end, went through the website and some of your portfolio companies, and Leon also gave me a quick blurb about the fund, so I'm somewhat familiar. Maybe we can just dive down and can can sure? Yeah, so Mark, I am Priyesh. I'm currently a senior associate at Qualcomm ventures, where I primarily look at AI, both infrastructure and applications and physical AI, so robotics and all the tech stack that goes behind it. I've also done a couple of computer vision investments, so that's that fits in both the spaces of physical ai plus AI. But prior to this, I've been in venture for close to three and a half years now, about close to two years at Qualcomm ventures. But prior to that, I've done a bunch of internships while I was doing my MBA. So during my MBA, I worked about with about seven funds, led the student fund, led the President group at the entrepreneurial group at UCLA, and at the same time, continually, continue to work with different funds. A few notable ones amongst those would be Menlo Ventures in the Bay Area where I worked in there both studio arm and the investment arm trying to be sort of a bridge between those two. But I also work with Morpheus ventures for close to a year, which is an LA based fund, and halogen ventures, which is,

S Speaker 22:15No, absolutely, that's, that's, that's great touch point mark. And then prior to my venture roles. I was originally in India where I did my undergrad from it Madras. It was a five year school, so I have a B Tech and M Tech in engineering. And during those entire five years, while my discipline was biotechnology, I was very interested in entrepreneurship, so kind of followed the same sort of playbook that I did during my MBA, and continued to work with different startups during my entire five years. So I did more than 10 internships during my five years at IIT Madras. Worked with a bunch of startups across edtech, social media, FinTech, food tech, cloud, cloud kitchens, food delivery, hyper local delivery and things like that. I took roles across product, growth, go to market, design, branding, and got very interested in entrepreneurship. So once I graduated, I joined a company called CleanMax as a business development role. Joined them around series A I was one of the early business hires in the team. Then grew on to take more responsibilities by leading a few business verticals, and also then worked on their corporate development team, saw the company grow from series, yeah.

S Speaker 23:35yeah. So clean Max is primarily an Asia Pacific company, Mark and they set up wind solar hybrid wind and solar plants and sell energy as long term SaaS contracts to the likes of Facebook, Amazon. So I worked with Facebook's first Asia Pacific Energy deal, and I worked, I started the carbon credits business as well. Brought in roughly about 17 million era that I can sort of credit to my name, but the company has been doing great. They're filing for an IPO now, and

S Speaker 14:24Okay, got it? Um, so you've been at quahan ventures for a couple years. Yes, can you kind of tell me what are sort of the sectors and stages that you have had a chance to focus on? Yes, if any?

S Speaker 24:38Yes, absolutely. Mark, so I've, I've been involved in six deals so far during at Qualcomm ventures, and we have been very stage agnostic. So these deals have ranged from early stage, pre product seed rounds to also very late stage, about Series C, series D in a computer vision company. So it's this from a stage perspective, it's spanned all across this gamut. From an investment perspective, I've invested in a company, I've invested in a couple of AI infra companies, one AI application company, one humanoid robots company, and a couple of computer vision companies.

S Speaker 15:20So did you source those deals? Or were you mostly on the deal execution, or what was kind of the role that you had? Yeah.

So did you source those deals? Or were you mostly on the deal execution, or what was kind of the role that you had? Yeah.
S Speaker 25:28So most of it, I was leading the deal execution. End to end, I've sourced a couple of deals for the company. Two deals in particular, both of those got stuck down by the Qualcomm compliance team, because it wasn't sort of going through the strategic fit, and also sort one of it got flagged by the compliance team, so we could not write term sheets in both of those. But two of the deals that I had sourced past the IC, but we couldn't write term sheets on them.

S Speaker 16:00Okay, okay. And then, like, obviously, you have to, you have to do the deals according to, I would assume, Qualcomm's, you know, corporate mandates, right? Yes, you know, if you're not constrained by that, and if you were constrained just by financial return, you know, kind of what, what sectors would be of most
Okay, okay. And then, like, obviously, you have to, you have to do the deals according to, I would assume, Qualcomm's, you know, corporate mandates, right?

6:23interest to you. Now,
interest to you. Now,
interest to you. Now,
interest to you. Now,
S Speaker 26:25I would like to invest quite actively in AI applications. I'm spending a lot of time in that space. I spent a lot of time in video AI. And I have a very strong thesis in that space. I've mapped almost every company in that space I have also spent, I'm starting to spend some time in like, what, like, what sort of company, like, application, yes, marks, like a cap cut or something like that. The likes of those, as well as the likes of foundation model companies developing video AI ll on. So the thesis does not like the way I've approached it, I have not recommended investing in a foundation model company. However, because of some strategic considerations, we may go forward and invest in one of those. I also take took a look at all of the application companies that are coming up in the space, leveraging the foundation model players and then creating workflows on top of it, quite similar to how we have seen the LLM space grow and amongst all of those companies, made a recommendation to invest in one company which finally got flagged because of not a strong Qualcomm. Bu fit.

S Speaker 17:33Okay, so one question would be, things seem to be working out for you pretty well at Qualcomm, although not every deal that you want to go through goes through, and not every deal that you don't want to go through doesn't go through. But that's pretty normal for any venture fund, right? Where you are not the GP, right? Yeah, so like, what? Why would you like to make a move?

S Speaker 27:56So Mark, potentially, absolutely, and I agree with your assessment. There, things have been great at Qualcomm. Ventures have been very active. Deal flow has been active, and I am the only senior associate principal level guy in the team working with a team of eight partners. So I do get to see quite a lot, and that has been an incredible Crash Course into venture. But at the same time, I don't see myself having a long term career here. Path for me growing at Qualcomm ventures would be to develop more relationships internally, understand Qualcomm's mandate better try to become that bridge or the eyes and ears of Qualcomm in the early stage entrepreneurial world. I do see myself at a more financial fund, being able to take more risk appetite, working more closely with some of the investments I do, and at the same time, also have some more skin in the game. So that's primarily why I would like to make a move. I'm not very actively recruiting, but Leon mentioned wi and it seemed an incredible opportunity, so I wanted to have a chat.

So that's primarily why I would like to make a move. I'm not very actively recruiting, but Leon mentioned wi and it seemed an incredible opportunity, so I wanted to have a chat.
So Mark, potentially, absolutely, and I agree with your assessment. There, things have been great at Qualcomm. Ventures have been very active. Deal flow has been active, and I am the only senior associate principal level guy in the team working with a team of eight partners. So I do get to see quite a lot, and that has been an incredible Crash Course into venture. But at the same time, I don't see myself having a long term career here.

S Speaker 19:56you spend a lot of time with clean Max, like, that's, that's, like, the interest resume that's, that's four years. Yeah, that's pretty long time. Yes, you know, how do you feel about clean tech now

S Speaker 210:12i i have so I'm bullish on clean tech for sure, Mark and especially all the CapEx investments that are happening in AI, clean tech will have its resurgence, as say, a secondary market, just riding the rust, riding the tailwinds on AI. So I quite believe in those markets. I also feel clean Max will have a very strong future in up ahead, when there are a lot of data centers being built in the Asia, Pacific region and India specifically, and just having some of these contracts with some of these players, these guys are also positioned to win very well. However, I've spent so much time in AI right now, and I started investing in AI when the exact AI boom was happening, so I have gotten first hand experience from the inception of this entire wave. I feel I would like to continue being in this space.

S Speaker 111:03So AI is where you really want to focus. Yes, going forward, but you know that we have to look at all sectors, right? So, you know, we don't have a big enough team where everybody can specialize onto whatever sub sectors they would like to specialize. We still have to look at all sectors, and we're a small, tight knit team, so you know that means that we have to wear a lot of hats and cover a lot of things that we may not be experts in, right? So is that something that's interesting to you? That's that's

S Speaker 211:34even better mark if you see, if you run through my resume, you'll see that I've almost hopped industries more frequently than one would like. I've worked with 10 different startups across edtech, social media, the ones I mentioned, I've done an undergrad in biotechnology and then worked in clean tech, and then now I'm spending time in AI. I kind of enjoy first principles thinking, breaking down problems, understanding things from a systems thinking, perspective and just jumping into new industries. So I certainly enjoy that quite a lot. I also feel AI the way it is evolving would probably touch, say, 50% of different industries as well. So that gives me an edge in those areas, but I'm quite open to also working across different industries, evaluating different spaces, maybe down the line if I get an opportunity in healthcare, biotech, those would be incredible learning experiences

I do expect a little bit of skin in the game, a little bit of ownership and opportunity to create the right convictions, create the thesis, and have an IC sort of tear it down and really sort of evaluate it on its merits, and then down the line, say, a personal deadline I have for me is in five years I see myself as a partner, and post that another five years, I would like to start a fund of my own.

S Speaker 113:19aware of the senior associate position, right? Yes, okay. And, you know, obviously, I think the expectation is, is that you know, for whoever you know can get this position, you know, it has to be very hands on, very hands on in sort of all of the operational stuff, and, you know, really whole a lot of weight, I think that's, that's kind of the expectation we're a small, tight knit team. So, you know, I think one potential concern that that that we generally have is, you know, for people that are coming from very large organizations where there's an expectation of certain lifestyle, and it's an expectation of, you know, certain very regimented and structured, yeah, whereas I feel like we have to wear many hats, and then we have to play up and play down and And, yeah, we have to, you know, we're a small fund, you know. So, yeah, we're not, we're not an infinite balance sheet, you know, fund. We have to, we have to be careful and pick and choose what you why, wisely, what we'd like to invest in, yeah? And, you know, at some point we have to go out and fundraise as well. So, you know, those are some of the constraints that we might have that you may not have when you're at Qualcomm ventures.

S Speaker 214:48I think Mark, just looking at my eventual goals and also my past background and experiences, I think this would be a better fit than what I have at Qualcomm ventures. I eventually want to start a fund of my own, or maybe, like just do something on my own, and I need to also learn the ropes of the other side of the thing and venture, I understand is you have to have experience around fund cycles, LP, reporting, raising a fund, things like that. That's something I don't get today at Qualcomm ventures, and that's one of the reasons I want to pivot into a more financial fund, and also, if you look back at all of my past experiences, I have made it a point for myself to never join a very large organization. I really enjoy the chaos that early stage brings, and I've always tried to be in that space. Qualcomm ventures was my first step into into the venture ecosystem in Silicon Valley, and it was great experience, but I would always love to be in a more entrepreneurial setup, sort of wear more hats, try to do a lot of things at once.

15:54Okay, got it. And then
Okay, got it. And then
Okay, got it. And then
Okay, got it. And then
S Speaker 116:00last question, then I opened up to you for your question, can you, can you describe to me the specific deals that you worked on that you would like to highlight at Qualcomm, yeah,
last question, then I opened up to you for your question, can you, can you describe to me the specific deals that you worked on that you would like to highlight at Qualcomm, yeah,

last question, then I opened up to you for your question, can you, can you describe to me the specific deals that you worked on that you would like to highlight at Qualcomm, yeah,
S Speaker 216:12absolutely. Mark. So one of the latest deals that I've done is a company called airtap. We did this. We did a seed, even pre seed, if you can call it, the company is still in stealth today. Airtap is an AI infrastructure company which provides a browser use, computer use, like infrastructure for mobile use to all agentic AI development platforms. So think of it as say, if you're developing an agent which has to scrape through or browse through your mobile applications today and then create automations on top of it, airtap is an infra that can enable that these guys are, today, the best at Android world bench, which is the benchmark for mobile app use, even better than Google's own application. And the way that they do it is, they have a virtual instance of your mobile phone on cloud, and then they use their own infra to browse applications through that, through that virtual phone. The way, the word, what was very interesting to me in this deal was the company is actually a spin off of now GG, which is a cloud streaming platform, and it allowed people to sort of test mobile games on PCs. So it was an emulator system had a lot of the company was built on scale. So it had it supported about 100 million concurrent users in the past. So the company has been tested on scale, the benchmarks work the founder has shipped and built and grown consumer platforms in the past, including now GG, which is now holding an exit and this company is spinning out of it. So the plan is to create a consumer app, the sort of first consumer app which is in mobile agents system on top of mobiles, which hasn't been done yet so far. So I expect it to create a quite a big Viral Launch when it does, and as a downside if it does not work, the plan is all to also to partner with the likes of lovable emergent and all of these white coding apps to provide this infra to some of these companies so that they can build agents on top of it. It seemed like a very interesting opportunity. We did this deal alongside Axel and Madrona.
