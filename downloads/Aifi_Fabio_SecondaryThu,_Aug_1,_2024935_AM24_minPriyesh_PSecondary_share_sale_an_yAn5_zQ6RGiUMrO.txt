S Speaker 216:17we hired? We just hired a sales director called Allah. He came from a company called better AI. So it was pretty much a company that was doing heat maps day or in several locations, and now we are trying to expand that to different customers. We have some prospects already happening at shop Bucha are the one big thing that the retailers always as far as is planogram compliance and all of stocked shelves shelves are out of stock. So we are starting to do GSP Tropica. And some others like we had a conversation of the Dollar General as well. Ship Barclay actually paused a little bit stalled because they decided to move a different route but they're coming back with Microsoft. So we are still building this. We believe in 2025 we may have like $3 million of AR from the special AI for 25 and 2026 make them for that but it'd be pretty much on both types of use case like we have enough POC we feature name that they want to track where the people are inside of the store in New York. You can create a cemetery situate h&m, when they pick up will be a fusion between RFID and computer vision. You pick up a card and went to the fitting room while you're trying to drop this cord and you didn't buy it like like a sales partner. They want to find out the status of the whole store like in a website. So just the person on that showing up. Right. So how can we digitalize our retail in the the regular store the same tools that we have on on our website so this is happening with h&m dresses happy with the job because while there's a lot of of this happening, there is a lot of like there's more use cases for like, Hey, let me know if someone came inside of the store or someone in this region that they shouldn't be here. So there's a lot of this happening as well. Of course in the pre Dawn there's a lot of like tracking the people in the clubs. You went to a club, you have your season ticket holder there and you are like okay, I'm spending x amount of time in the court and I'm spending x amount of time in the club. They want to know exactly how much but people are very good people live in Southern state or what they are getting or they're not getting or they're like having why they're not buying some snacks or why they are not having because it's for free but like okay, we put in a snack did people came in was without it was a rough spot. So there's a lot of that's happening right now. A lot of conversations happening. There probably cheaper solutions than the than the autonomous car but more scalable, like so. Yeah. And they have like way less because of you don't need to have the accuracy and the time it doesn't need to be like as fast as an autonomous checkout needs to weigh less computing the computing powers res monitor the cost is really small. So they will have a better margins but they will have lower bags, of course like so you cannot charge as much as you're charged for autonomous cars. Yeah, but couldn't have a way more.

S Speaker 220:46gonna use the spatial AI for like upsell on the customers like Hey, Dr. Ken, here's your 30 day free trial for out of stock out there. Here's our pre trial like hey, here's our free trial for so we're gonna probably also work on that like it's not that problems gonna have a set of products and allow the customers to use when they do the autonomous checkout for a small fee at the end of the month. Right,
gonna use the spatial AI for like upsell on the customers like Hey, Dr. Ken, here's your 30 day free trial for out of stock out there.
