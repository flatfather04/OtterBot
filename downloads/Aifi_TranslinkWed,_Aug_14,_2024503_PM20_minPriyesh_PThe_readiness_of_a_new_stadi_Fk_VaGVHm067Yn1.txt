0:08Yeah. Hey, Eric, thanks for the flexibility. Thanks

Yeah. Hey, Eric, thanks for the flexibility. Thanks
S Speaker 20:40I have no. I mean, I think, you know, how do I look at if I think, and how do we translate look at if I think, one is, we're seeing the market develop, so we're seeing it within the events and venue space, and that's a place that they can dig, they can mine. And there's a known value proposition there. I think the Intuit dome as a showcase is going to be really important. That's why I'm headed down to LA going down Friday. I'm going, I want to see it, right? I don't want to just hear about it. I don't want to hear the report about it. I'm going to, I'll give a report to everybody after is the cost of tomorrow, it's tomorrow, but I'm going to Fridays. So I'll be going down Friday. Okay? And you know, they there are still some technical issues with what if I says, is the the supplier of the facial recognition so that idap unit that we saw we visited, that they're still having trouble identifying people on an accurate enough basis. So it remains to be seen how Thursday goes and then what they're going to do on Friday. But there are some uncertainties there. So we're they're not sure exactly what experience ultimately will be rolled out to to attend these My hope is that no matter what is it they rolled out, they do limit it is that people still come out saying that was the best stadium experience they've ever been to. That's what I want to hear, and that's what I'm going to be paying attention to. But I think there's a likelihood that not the full suite of services will be available across the board, from shopping to food and beverage, but I'm not exactly sure what it's going to be. So I think being there, do they have a plan?

S Speaker 12:23We're talking we're catching up with Steve tomorrow, but you know, if they have a plan

We're talking we're catching up with Steve tomorrow, but you know, if they have a plan
S Speaker 22:27so they they're able to do what they need to do, there's a backup plan in terms of payment that's being talked about with regards to any of the transaction based services. So there's a plan around using a square checkout for checkout. They could leave the doors open and and then do Pay Process Payment sort of manually on your exit. That is an ultimate backup option. The belief is that tomorrow, the systems will be allowed to run and go and that Ballmer, like he said on one of their earlier, smaller, sort of community based events that they held early on, I think it was with 5000 people that he's willing to eat the losses if the systems don't work exactly right? So I think tomorrow, they're going to try and let it, let it go, and then Friday, they're going to react to what happened Thursday and determine what ultimately it's that I will be experiencing and seeing. But so I'll let you know how that goes and what I learned from that and what I see. But I think it's really important. I think you know that has the opportunity to crystallize them. There's about 15 stadiums that are getting built in the US over the next couple years. So there's a real business that they can build off of, and build a business off of, not a gigantic business off of, but a business off of. And so that gives me comfort on the risk profile of the company, I think, within all the other venues, such as corporate airports, all this other stuff, I think is still taking time, that's my assessment of it. And even within retail, with, you know, our close partner, Zabka and all the I think they're going to continue to do more, but it's taking time. And so how do I handicap that against the enterprise, or what they call spatial AI opportunity? I think there's that. That's something we talked about today on a call that I had with them, which was, you know, how do you think about relative opportunity, and then how do you apply your resources to that? The other question I had is, are we selling in the right way or in the optimal way, in terms of our sales teams? Do we need to focus more doing that? So there's some, some of the things I think about, but

S Speaker 14:59I think at the core, regardless of spatial AI, this is just right. You say that's okay, yeah, when we met with Neeraj, he did mention that, you know, there are questions whether Joe, Joe is the right guy to leave, right? Yeah. What are your thoughts on that?
I think at the core, regardless of spatial AI, this is just right. You say that's okay, yeah, when we met with Neeraj, he did mention that, you know, there are questions whether Joe, Joe is the right guy to leave, right? Yeah. What are your thoughts on that?

S Speaker 25:16I think it's question my head. Joe is on the call with me today for about an hour and a half. I think he's done some good things. I think it depends on what our assessment of what the sales process needs to be. Does it need to be a more consultative sales process, strategic sales process? Do we need a team? Right now, you got an account manager, and it's like a point person dealing with very large organizations, but in the back of my head, I said, for these kind of complex sales, you probably need a team of people. And there's a consultative sales portion of that. There's a technical sales field person as part of that. There's the account manager part of it. But is it a bigger team that's required to drive these things across the line in a more deterministic fashion. I think what we've seen from quarter to quarter is that opportunities are there, but they get pushed back and they take longer than we would like to see in the average sales cycle. I think reviewed today, six to eight months. They'd like to bring it down, but how do you bring it down? And what do you do instead of doing the same things that we've always been doing, you know. So, you know, part of it, you know, the discussions I've had with Niraj is like, how much does this company need to, not have to think about capital too much? I think the number that came to is around 17 million. Is it maybe, perhaps a little bit more than that could be.

S Speaker 16:41We think we'll get to that this part of this round? I
We think we'll get to that this part of this round? I
We think we'll get to that this part of this round? I
We think we'll get to that this part of this round? I
S Speaker 26:44think it depends on, I mean, Rogers effort on the SBB, I think is a very meaningful effort for the company. If he's able to pull that off, that's going to de risk the company significantly. The way that we've looked at it here at TransLink is that at a minimum, the company needs $10 so no matter what, for us to have funded the first tranche, we said we believe there's visible and to say that we're not going to close 10 million the first close, we did the work and the analysis and said we believe that we can reach at least 10 million. And on top of that, if we're short in any of that, we'll double our program. So that's the approval that I have from my investment committee to support the company. Now, if the company raises more than that 10 million, gets to 15 million without the SPV, you know, will we do more? That'll be a discussion. I go back to my committee with and say, hey, you know what? This fundraiser actually turned up better than we expected. I do think the opportunity is there. The only question mark in my head is it's still a lumpy opportunity in terms of revenue, traction, revenue forecast. So this is not a business yet where people are banging on the door and saying, I got to have this in my store or in my customer experience. Yet that day will come, but it hasn't come yet. So the question is, how long it's going to take to get there? I believe the stadium business has the opportunity to keep the company going while we're trying to get to that point. And will that point come? It will come if it comes five years from now, then it won't work out. If it comes three years from now, two years from now, it'll be a great company, right? That's the opportunity,
think it depends on, I mean, Rogers effort on the SBB, I think is a very meaningful effort for the company. If he's able to pull that off, that's going to de risk the company significantly.

S Speaker 38:15we're very much aligned in terms of thinking. Did you, you
we're very much aligned in terms of thinking. Did you, you
we're very much aligned in terms of thinking. Did you, you
we're very much aligned in terms of thinking. Did you, you
S Speaker 18:21know, if you look at the company projections, they have, like, this big dollars for special AI, next year, already, 10 million bucks, right? I'm like, how do you go from zero to 10? I've not seen a startup. I mean, this is a product line, but I've not seen a product line, sure. Well, from zero to 10, right? How are you guys looking at this? Do you believe the is like heavily discounting longer term. Do you think that your business, because there's also unclear to me at this juncture, or there's a lot of people talking about this, right? So do they have a differentiated offering with sustainable advantages? What are you guys' thoughts on this?
know, if you look at the company projections, they have, like, this big dollars for special AI, next year, already, 10 million bucks, right? I'm like, how do you go from zero to 10? I've not seen a startup. I mean, this is a product line, but I've not seen a product line, sure. Well, from zero to 10, right? How are you guys looking at this? Do you believe the is like heavily discounting longer term. Do you think that your business, because there's also unclear to me at this juncture, or there's a lot of people talking about this, right?

S Speaker 28:57I mean, I think our belief is that they solve the more difficult problem in terms of, you know, what they picked as the initial problem, so, which is retail and so to be able to track objects, people and in space over time is something that's not easy to do. And they and they do it, and they do it quite well. I think there's value in that, I think in terms of the pace at which that can grow, it's going to be lumpy if you just look at a company, the best company that I've talked to my investment committee about as a reference point is ouster as the LIDAR company that basically started in building a lidar for the automotive or the autonomous automotive space, and then they're probably one of the first companies that say, Wow, this might take longer than expected, and pivoted into saying, How can we apply this into the enterprise application space? So they sell for robotics applications. They sell for all different kinds of applications outside of automotive and and they've grown a nice business out of it, but it's a lumpy business. So in their most recent quarter, they continue to grow, but there's lumpiness in the business, and Wall Street doesn't like lumpines. So what it tells me is that there is a market. There are applications. People are looking for applications. The current AI wave has basically pushed executive a greater executive willingness and commitment to investing in these types of solutions, because it's related to AI, and it shows that they're doing something around AI and applying it towards their businesses. So that's unlocked budget dollars, and you're seeing it show up in some of these companies, like ouster. What's clear is that it's not uniform across the board, and big contracts are going to matter, so it's going to be a lumpy business. So you have to be able to prepare, from a finance perspective, that your quarters are going to be lumpy for a period of time before this stuff becomes more went through

S Speaker 111:04so so maybe, to summarize, in general, you feel they, they have built something that Scott differentiation, but obviously, it's not a stand up. It's going to be a little while. Okay, okay, good. So, so basically, from what I hear, you got the initial check. You willing to do two extra pro rata. That's right, right? But you're not doing SP PV. You're not doing the

S Speaker 211:35Raj is off doing that, and we talked about how to close the gap, and he felt that he could do it. And so He's launching this SPV effort. I mean, he's already doubled down on the secondary. I think our greatest, you know, for our capital, we think we got to get the primary right first. And if he's successful in that, that's great. I think our additional participation, for certain, will be there if we don't hit the 10 million mark, come with 30 or 45 days from the initial close, if we do have much more money come in, would we then it's just a discussion with our partner. We have a bunch of companies. Our fund for which I five is in, is is already returned capital and then some. So it's basically a capital allocation between my partners and I in terms of what make the most money going forward.

S Speaker 112:28Okay, okay. Speaking of that, you guys, what are you guys looking at? Let's say they raised the 15 now, when do you think they have a next fundraising? What do you think is the potential? That's it for these guys. Yeah,
Okay, okay. Speaking of that, you guys, what are you guys looking at? Let's say they raised the 15 now, when do you think they have a next fundraising? What do you think is the potential? That's it for these guys. Yeah,

S Speaker 212:45and my hope is that it stays an independent business, but I think it's you raise 15 now you're probably 18 months, and you've got some milestones that you can show that you can go out and raise or raise some additional capital. Now the plan says you don't need more than that. It may need more than that. I think there'll be enough that's enough to show Stadium as a leader. It's enough to show, hopefully, retail progress. So Aldi goes to number two, hopefully number three and enough to show the enterprise side has some real application. I think if you can show those green shoots, people would be really interested, because there are already companies out there that are publicly traded, that are just living off of building business in those areas.

S Speaker 113:45did you in terms of the process so far, I know you guys actually wrote the initial term sheet? Was there any backlash from the existing investors and this whole but there's a lot of secondary a lot of folks trying to get out. No. Nobody parked. Nobody said Greg Craig Fauci saying, Hey, you do this term, and now you're forcing you not to invest. And now you know they're secondary, so you sort of, we have not, I

S Speaker 114:59okay, okay, that's that's good to hear. By the way, we agree it's a fair deal, because as we modeled, right, we modeled more on the lower end. I think I mentioned this before I push back on the amount of raise, but I agree that 15, 1718, puts us in a much better position than 13 or 12 net, right? So, you know, we have a similar situation to you. We got initial approval to to do Ferrara and then do close to two pro rata, if they raise more than 15, right? But now, with the sort of the excitement and this SPV, you know, things can change, right? You risking the business and the opportunity for secondary. So we are ourselves studying, but the original setting we had modeled like a next round, probably sometime next year, let's say 150 pre. So you know, for from 100 whatever, 15 posts now to 150 pre, not a whole lot of difference, right? So I think it's such a deal, okay?

S Speaker 216:05And for my partners, you know, what I'm going to go back with is, how did the launch go into it and and talk a little bit about the pipeline and the conversion of pipeline to revenue, yeah,

S Speaker 116:16so that that topic of the conversion, right? So he has a pipeline. This quarter was basically no growth in AR, right? And they, you know, blame it on the customer that delayed launches, whatever. We run the risk of sort of this propagating, right? You can either have a bigger pipeline on top, where you can actually have a better machine to convert the pipeline the bottom of funnel, right, your view is, if we had a like a sales spot, we'd probably get better results.
