I'm Alvaro and I'm the CEO of codes health. At codes, we are automating patient intake for specialty care providers. During intake, home health agencies have to gather patient records from physical therapists, neurologists, PCPs and more, by automating all back office workflows, our customers provide faster care, capture more revenue and decrease OPEX in three weeks of sales, we have closed two providers worth 19k in ARR there are over 500,000 clinics in the US, manually processing intake, delaying care months at a time, I previously built the fastest growing home health agency in the country, scaling from zero to 25 million ARR in two years. I used to work with Austin, with a product of pulley, and went to MIT with Cody, our CTO together, we are automating intake, transforming care for providers and the patients who they serve. Thank you.

Hello. My name is Davide, and I'm the CEO of diode computers. Diode automates circuit board design using AI. Today, building circuit boards is manual, slow and expensive. With diode, you can build hardware in days. Not months since launching last month, we have $75,000 in revenue from robotics and defense companies. One of our customers is paying us $50,000 to design and manufacture a flight controller for a Department of Defense Contract. This would have taken them three months to get to market with an electrical engineer with us. They got board delivered in three weeks before download it. Our team built harder at Apple and startups that shipped custom silicon. We've seen firsthand how circuit board design causes roadmap to slip and budgets to grow. We're solving this. We are going after the $90 billion circuit board design and manufacturing market. Thank you.

Tal, hi. I'm Tal, CEO and co founder of Echo, the founder led sales copilot. Echo makes every founder really good at sales. Our co pilot tells them exactly what to say during a sales call to win the business, including how to respond to any objections that come up. We launched a month ago, and within just two weeks of working with us, one of our customers fired their human sales coach is already closing a major new deal and told us that echo changed their life. But making individual founders great at sales is just the beginning. Echo will become a more and more capable copilot, and inevitably, it will do the sales itself. Our vision is to enable startups to scale their sales without hiring, and as they grow, we'll grow with them. There are over 30 million junior sales reps in the US ripe for automation, representing a $150 billion market. We are echo, thank you.

Hey, my name is Kaylin. My co founder Evan and I are building Gage. Gage is solving the monolith microservices dilemma. We're working with companies to take large code bases and break them into small pieces. My co founder and I are founding engineers. Three times over, we built ground up product at Carta and took our last startup from zero to over 5 million in ARR, at each company that we worked at, we ran into the same problem. The larger the company became, the slower developer velocity was. We're building the tools that we wish we had. Our first tool has over 1000 stars on GitHub, over 475,000 downloads, and is in use by teams at Nvidia. In the last month, we've also signed live pilots with rippling and instawork. We are Gage.

Hey, everyone. My name is Lev, and I'm the CEO of Terra. We are fair for custom overseas manufacturing. We aggregate orders from multiple brands in the same industry, allowing those brands to get wholesale pricing at any order quantity. Previously, as teenagers, my co founder, Jill and I bootstrapped furniture and lightsaber businesses. We generated over $15 million in revenue in three years. It is there that we struggled to find manufacturers that were cost competitive, so we dropped out of an OU stern to solve this. Four weeks since launching, we've generated over 18,000 in GMV and 5.5k and MRR with six brands, we've partnered with eight manufacturers and a major freight forwarder, we're going after the 77,000 brands in the US to generate over $16 million per year, representing $112 billion market opportunity. We are terror. Thank you.

Sid, I'm the co founder of pulse. We are building AI agents for supply chain management at large enterprises. My co founder and I worked at Nvidia and Tesla, where we realized that even amongst the worst world's most complex companies, the critical work of managing inventory is all done by humans. Their mistakes can cost millions of dollars in shipment delays every single week, our agents automate these workflows cheaper and faster. In just our first two weeks of sales, we hit 42,000 in annual revenue. Our customers are using us to track their global operations across the entire supply chain.

Hi, I'm lakshay and I'm the CEO of Cerulean. We are an open source operating system for robots. Today, most robots use robot operating system or Ros, but its networking layer is slow and drops packets. This causes robots to be unreliable. We solve this. Cerulean has a networking layer that is 100% reliable and reduces latency from milliseconds to nanoseconds since launching three weeks ago. Teams at Amazon robotics and Boston Dynamics use us to deploy their robots. I have two bachelors and two masters in four years from UPenn and between us, the founders have 10 plus years of experience in robotics, including our PhDs at MIT. We are replacing ROS to become the de facto OS for robots. We are Cerulean. Thank you.

Hi, I'm Ed and I'm the CEO of LIGO. I started LIGO with two other scientists from Oxford University. We're using AI to design enzymes for chemical manufacturing. Enzymes are just proteins that convert one chemical into another, and currently, all of the big chemical manufacturers are trying to use enzymes. The issue is, designing enzymes for new reactions can take years, cost millions, and often just doesn't work. Our model learns how to design enzymes from huge amounts of biological data. This will allow us to create new enzymes for many more chemical reactions, making their synthesis cheaper and more sustainable. In the YC batch, we have designed and validated our closed source model, which now has 4.3 million in allies in two pilots already initiated. We've also open sourced the model, which has beta testers that include DuPont Merck and novelzymes. We online it. Thank you.

I'm Abi, and my co founder is Alex. We're building custom silicon to run neural networks up to 20 times faster and with eight times less RAM right now, we're proving it with just software. GPUs are great at training, but not at inference. With our open source tool, we made inference faster by distilling models into our ternary format. This uses just two bits to represent model weights instead of the standard 16 bits, we distilled a model that previously needed 14 gigabytes of RAM to only need two gigabytes for a paying customer. Previously, Alex worked on firmware for sensors on the James Webb Telescope when he was 17, and I was one of the first to modify consumer NVIDIA GPUs to use server RAM. When I was 16, we both dropped out of Dartmouth engineering as freshmen to start deep silicon and pursue Nvidia's $2 trillion market cap. Thank you.

Hi, I'm Abdul, CEO of Cartage. Cartage autonomously coordinates freight between shippers and trucking companies. We are eliminating human coordinators in trucking. We saw the work of freight coordination, not software, replacing both freight brokers and in house logistics teams. We are currently moving freight for 31 shippers across the US and Canada, with 47,000 net revenue in September. Look around you, everything you see was on a truck. Shippers spent 400 billion on freight coordination every year. You're essentially paying for people to coordinate data, sending emails and making phone calls. We replace humans with AI, reducing costs and saving shippers millions on freight coordinating it at margins traditional vendors cannot touch. This is an $80 billion market opportunity in the US alone. Our secret is that we don't change how anyone works. Trucking runs on emails and phone calls. That's not going to change. Everyone who has tried has failed, but for the first time in human history, you can automate freight coordination without changing how anyone works. We are Cartage. Thank you. Applause.

We are currently moving freight for 31 shippers across the US and Canada, with 47,000 net revenue in September. Look around you, everything you see was on a truck. Shippers spent 400 billion on freight coordination every year. You're essentially paying for people to coordinate data, sending emails and making phone calls. We replace humans with AI, reducing costs and saving shippers millions on freight coordinating it at margins traditional vendors cannot touch. This is an $80 billion market opportunity in the US alone. Our secret is that we don't change how anyone works. Trucking runs on emails and phone calls. That's not going to change. Everyone who has tried has failed, but for the first time in human history, you can automate freight coordination without changing how anyone works. We are Cartage. Thank you. Applause.

Hi, I'm Ray co founder of Fogle. Fogle is AI powered compliance operations for banks and fintechs to handle the increasing burdens of compliance. Financial institutions are using more humans than ever to manually review activities. At stripe, we scaled payments volume from five to 500 billion, and launched our issuing and banking products. There, we saw firsthand good accounts being erroneously frozen, while bad accounts generated losses and brand risk, 1000s of humans were the last line of defense, navigating hundreds of complex reviews, oftentimes leading to low quality decisions and long handle times. We're in talks with a number of large fintechs and top 200 banks and piloting our first AI agents to expedite enhanced due diligence, performing tasks that, when done manually, takes 10s of minutes. Our AI agents can perform this work in seconds with higher consistency and clear documentation of work. Compliance operations is a $6 billion market opportunity in the US growing rapidly. We're vocal, and we scale compliance operations with AI. Thank you. Applause.

Hi, I'm Andrew the co founder and CEO of coprabio. Coprabio makes genetically engineered viruses that teach your immune system to kill cancer using technology that we developed at UCSF. We just completed our animal studies in the most challenging brain cancer model, and the results are amazing. All of the animals treated with a current FDA approved drug died within 50 days. 90% of the animals that we treated are still alive 250 days later, we're making the next keytruna, a $25 billion per year oncology blockbuster, and we're starting with the most aggressive form of brain cancer, glioblastoma. I'm a two time YC biotech founder with an exit and my co founder, Dr Haddad, is a neurosurgeon at UCSF who published 70 peer reviewed papers before the age of 30. I lost my uncle to prostate cancer last week, and I will not rest until our treatment is available for every patient that needs it. We are copra bio, thank you. Applause.

Music, hello. My name is Daniel, and I'm the founder and CEO of able police. Able police takes police body camera footage and turns it into completed police reports. Patrol officers currently spend 1/3 of their shift writing reports. Turning this to zero would effectively increase the police force by 50% radically changing US cities. We are already live with a 100 badge agency, and we are in late stage talks with multiple other agencies. We estimate, we say, police 78% of the time they would normally spend writing reports at our price level, the market opportunity for automated police reporting is 1.7 billion annual. The industry has deep sales networks, which we have penetrated by taking on a board of advisors, including the former president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police. I first realized the chaos of not having the police when you need them, when a friend was going through a domestic violence situation and I had to wait 45 minutes with the police, I realized I had to do something, so I sold my last company and started able. Now that we've been embedded with an agency, we see up close just how outdated their technology is, and we have a roadmap of future products to expand to. We are able, police. Thank you. Applause.

And we started because 12 million people saw our CTO Ian's tweet about our solution to this problem, all while I was still at Stanford and our chief scientist, Sasha, was still doing his PhD at Yale in the six months since then, we've developed the smallest, lightest and most cost effective GPS replacement on the market. We've shipped to paying customers in the DOD, and after just four days of testing with Army Special Forces, they submitted a 10 million funding request to buy 1500 of our units next fiscal year. Thank you.

Hello. My name is Pawel, and I'm the CEO of claim sorted. Claim sorted makes it easy for insurance companies to process claims. Having built an insurance company in the past, we discovered that most claims are not processed by insurance directly. Instead, insurers outsource claims to claims agencies. These agencies, in essence, are huge warehouses with 1000s of people manually processing millions of claims every year. These agencies are expensive, slow and make tons of mistakes. We are building a new kind of claims agency, automating over 80% of work with AI in just three months, we completed three pilots and have over $3 million in our sales pipeline insurers spent over $200 billion on claims. Agencies and new regulations mean more companies will need to outsource claims. Thank you.
