S Speaker 10:33Yeah, totally, totally understand, Philip and thanks a lot for making it. And I'm sure, I'm sure the timeline is tight. And in fact, I think the next round would probably make more sense for us, given our check sizes, but I'm happy to give you a quick background about the fund. I know we are short on time, so I'll keep it quick. And I think just setting the agenda, what I really want to get out of this, Philip is one understand the platform a little bit better, but at the same time, go back internally at some of our Qualcomm business units. We work very closely with different industries, automotive, construction. We supply our sensors and technologies there. So we work very closely with several enterprises. I'd love to see if there's a partnership proposition that we can sort of discuss and build a conviction towards the next round.

S Speaker 11:21Philip, I'm a Senior Associate here at Qualcomm ventures. Been with the Fund for about two years, and been in venture for about four worked with Menlo Ventures in Bay prior to this, and then with morphs ventures in LA So, but the fund itself has been around for 25 years. Check sizes two to $15 million we do anywhere from seed to very late stage rounds. Invest out of Qualcomm's balance sheet. So we invest about one $50 million every year and invest out of the balance sheet. So we don't have any say. We can be long term partners. In that sense, we don't have any mandates to return capital or anything. Invest all across the spectrum. We've been very deep into, I'd say, industrial automation, connectivity, IoT in the past, and now recently investing more into AI. So that's mostly where our focus has been. Happy to answer any questions on the fun side, if you feel there are

S Speaker 22:21no I like the thought of the partnership, to be honest, because the industries you just mentioned are super interesting for us and for me. Series A is going to be most likely to be the point where I want some kind of a strategic I am close to the next 47 people. I'm talking to the Hitachi ventures people. But the core, the core idea for me is, ideally over those quarters, until then, I want to build a commercial relationship with the company itself, or see some like value, because money from investors is one thing, but then taking a strategic means, is there actually, like a business case, And then also potential exit case that can be accelerated

S Speaker 23:33Super good. Then I can tell you a little bit about myself at the company and show you a couple examples of what we do already. Yeah. So I grew up in Germany, spent 10 years in heavy industries. Started with a big automotive supplier, supply chain management, Process Management, synchronizer rings for for switching gears, supplying OEMs, and then wrote my master's thesis with SAP, won the German M A award, and then joined the top talent program at Siemens in the railing industry, and there I was working in the signaling business, sold hundreds of millions of dollars to the city of Hong Kong, city of Taipei, and then the top management consulting and then came to the US four years ago to join two acquisitions That Siemens made comfy and delighted. Yeah, and fun fact that was actually in the same building. Like, what is the company? Again? The guy's name is Thomas Kluge. He was at Qualcomm earlier, yeah, I think he was one of the, one of the founding partners of the Qualcomm ventures. Part fast forward. Started Nexa.

S Speaker 14:43Are we good on the connection? Yes, I can hear you. In fact, if you want to go off radio, that's fine too. I'm just

S Speaker 24:51Yeah, yeah. So the big idea and Nexa is that I observed industrial engineers and rail and construction automotive with master's degrees doing a lot of rule based, repetitive but complex work, from PDF to Excel to AutoCAD or other tools. The interesting thing about the industries that we focus on, which is which I call heavy project industries, is that you have enough pattern if you do a rail system for London or Hong Kong. It's different, but it's a lot of it is the same as well. So the big idea is that we we specialize and deploy computer use agents into the industrial engineering workflows of the companies that I just mentioned, Siemens, Caterpillar, Hitachi, yeah, and accelerate engineering productivity by 400% that is what we do. Fast forward, we have 18 customers. We just broke 1 million and contracted Arr, and that's congrats as an example of what we do. Thank you. Thank you. This is a good example of the work that we do, which is, for Siemens, we're reading 1000s of pages Braille diagrams that they get and create very, very accurate bombs, bills of materials. That is step one. There are takeoff companies everywhere now, which in my opinion, makes this this, this use case a little more boring. But the cool thing is that we do take off plus one plus two, which means this is the most, the most demo that I'm the most proud of. This is a 30 year old engineering tool. This is the work that a master's degree engineer has to do every single week, and it's creating a digital version of the diagram you just saw. Yeah, everything that's happening on the screen is our computer use agent doing the work of the engineer. This is an exit counter. This is a switch. And then if we go forward here, it starts to look a lot like two tracks and one switch. And our AI agent knows exactly what to do and how to do it based on the extraction of the diagram. Those are the use cases that exist in oil and gas, in automotive, in rail, and that's what we started with 10 months ago. And yeah, for the target to hit until our series A's, we want to be between four and 5 million in ARR by q1 q2 2027, yeah, we're hiring up. And, yeah, that's a little bit of a quick four minute intro stuff that we do.
Yeah, yeah.

S Speaker 17:27And Philip, so the work, the demo that I'm seeing here, how is it? How is the computer use API you being used here? Is it not just a computer vision to translation solution?

S Speaker 27:39So it's computer vision augmenting a computer use model, because something has to drive the screen, and the screen, like in the past, the screen has been driven by scripts and RPA box. Yeah, but in this case, we're actually, we're actually using computer vision to tell the computer use model what it's looking at and tell

8:00train it, what to do?

S Speaker 18:02Got it and Philip so naive question here, because I don't have a lot of information about these industries, but I'm sure you would have thought about it. Why do you have a computer vision, or, sorry, a computer use system to automate some of these workflows that operate on legacy systems rather than creating your own AI native system. How does those two approaches? Or have you thought about those two approaches?

How does those two approaches? Or have you thought about those two approaches?
S Speaker 28:31Yes, we think that the computer use automation and the existing stack is step one in order to rewrite the stack to an AI native way. So what our customers love about us is that they don't have to rip and replace their tools. Yeah, we just make everything they do better and faster first, and then we believe that AI is going to become good enough that by doing the work and using the tools, we can actually get, get the AI to rewrite the stack, and then our customers will also let us do it, and they will trust us to do it. If we would go there and say, here's an AI native tool in order to do your engineering, they would say, I'm not going to do anything with you. Yeah. So that's why we did it this way.

S Speaker 19:16That makes sense. Phil, I have a lot of questions, but I'll be mindful of the time here and understand you're busy. Would you be able to send me a deck and some of the demo videos? I would love to float these around internally and start a conversation, and then I think we can do this async, given there's not a live round, I can come back with to you with some of my questions, I'm sure, like the seed investors would have asked them. So you would have answers ready already, and we take it from there. How does that sound?
