S Speaker 211:06Tradition to have a visible interlude, and I am incredibly delighted to introduce today's special musical guest. Alexi Kenny. Is a world class violist. He's performed with some of the world's greatest orchestras, the San Francisco Symphony, the Cleveland Orchestra. He's won numerous awards, and he's the perfect person to bring this guy together, because he was born in Palo Alto. He's a Bay Area guy, and here's the quote about him. His career defies categorization. He's incredibly innovative. He's going to play two songs back to back, play one of which he organized, he arranged himself. I'm especially proud to present him because he's also last season presented here with Cal performances. How many of you heard of Cal performances? You're in our venue right now. This is our campus organization for performing arts, and like Skynet, we find talent from around the world, and bring it here to present to you. So please join me in an incredible, warm Welcome for the amazing Alexa Kenny. You
