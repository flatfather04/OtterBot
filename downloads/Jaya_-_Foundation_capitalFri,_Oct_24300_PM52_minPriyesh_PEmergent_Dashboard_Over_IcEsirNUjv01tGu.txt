S Speaker 321:10I think the venture recruiting process is just truly the most, you know, dumb thing on the planet. And I have a lot of respect from anyone that gets into it, especially from India, because it's like, I mean, here that I think they prioritize, like, you know, being polished and Caucasian, or whatever it might be. You're having some Nepo connection to, like, you know, your father can go buy all the companies. So, yeah, you know, mad respect for like, you sue the a bunch of other people that have, like, broken in, and especially, like, Ashu, the guy I work for him, he like, did the same thing. He, like, he kind of bothered some guy in a parking lot named sadana, and then he got the job that way, like, and he started as a contractor to focus on India seven. So wow, that's amazing, yeah, and now he's been GP for what, 12 years, and at foundation for 17, which is, like, insane, right?

They push the head of evals of mosaic. They poach, like, two senior research scientists from Mosaic. Which mosaic was? Like, you know, Naveen rouse teams, like, pretty strong, yeah. And then they did drop a few models. And then they are doing another launch soon. And I missed the last meeting because I was super sick with something. But one of the investors actually a Bessemer, went and joined the company. Oh, that's which is crazy. Yeah. He's like, you know, four or five years in a venture, and, right, it's supposed to be super confidential, but, you know, I think he was like, I'm so bullish that, like, I want to take, like, a, you know, lead and Bessemer was, like, the one with the biggest check, right?

25:49David Cohen himself.
S Speaker 225:51That's amazing. That's amazing. Yeah, we ran a few checks on the founder, and turns out he had mad credibility within the team, like a few other founders that I knew, all of them knew about the guy from meta, the fair team guy.

S Speaker 226:43That's amazing. That's amazing. How long is your process? In that case? Like, do you, how are you able to do all of this? Like, our process is not that rigorous. We still take four to six weeks to come to a decision, really.

S Speaker 326:55Okay, so I do reference calls very, very quickly. And I asked the founder for like, 10 reference calls. Like, pretty like, I asked them for song, yeah. And then I do them like, you know, 30 minutes back to back through my entire calendar. And just like, do them all in a day. And if someone is, like, really bullish on someone, they'll make time for that. Reference. Call is, like, what

S Speaker 227:13I found, wow, that's amazing. Yeah, I should, I should pick a few of these things.

Oh my gosh, no, no. But that's great. So your process four to six weeks.
Oh my gosh, no, no. But that's great. So your process four to six weeks.
S Speaker 227:21Yes. That also includes a few of internal compliance check that we have to do, loop in our legal team, things like that. So, so that elongates the process. Got

S Speaker 227:39a bunch of spaces? Yes, so I am, I'm spending a lot of time in video AI, there are a couple of companies that we would like to make investments on, also spending some time in AI, security and governance. So we, we have been looking at some companies more from model security evals, guardrails perspective, but also as some companies which can then go on to become the central nervous system for AI adoption across enterprises. And what would be that wedge to get into AI enterprises? We feel Qualcomm has a big problem around that we don't know, tons of shadow AI usage across the entire enterprise, and I'm sure a lot of enterprises have that. So speaking to a lot of companies in that space as well. Plan to do. There are a couple of interesting companies coming up. So there's singular AI, it's mostly Indian founders. There is a company called Lanai, they haven't GA Ed yet, and another company called witness AI. I think these three, I would call out the best companies in the space, especially in the AI governance space, and then spoken to the likes of hidden layer, Fiddler Galileo in the model security cartridge space, it seems like the traction there is picking up, and some of these companies want to shift from just model security To AI governance, but, but I think the likes of witness Lanai singular or escape trying to build for AI governance first would be the winners in the space. So we definitely want to make an investment in that area.

Yes, so I am, I'm spending a lot of time in video AI, there are a couple of companies that we would like to make investments on, also spending some time in AI, security and governance. So we, we have been looking at some companies more from model security evals, guardrails perspective, but also as some companies which can then go on to become the central nervous system for AI adoption across enterprises. And what would be that wedge to get into AI enterprises? We feel Qualcomm has a big problem around that we don't know, tons of shadow AI usage across the entire enterprise, and I'm sure a lot of enterprises have that. So speaking to a lot of companies in that space as well. Plan to do. There are a couple of interesting companies coming up. So there's singular AI, it's mostly Indian founders. There is a company called Lanai, they haven't GA Ed yet, and another company called witness AI. I think these three, I would call out the best companies in the space, especially in the AI governance space, and then spoken to the likes of hidden layer, Fiddler Galileo in the model security cartridge space, it seems like the traction there is picking up, and some of these companies want to shift from just model security To AI governance, but, but I think the likes of witness Lanai singular or escape trying to build for AI governance first would be the winners in the space. So we definitely want to make an investment in that area.

S Speaker 329:12So, so actually, it's crazy. You say that we have a company that is literally about to fundraise, probably starting next week, doing both sides of and they agree with your thesis and that you need to solve the shadow employees access security first. I call it access security and Agent security. I know I oversimplified it, but and then, sure, there's model security too, but I think that the you're right, the employee access security is like problem one, like, people are uploading, like, like, Oh my God, my friend is like a she works for, like, a CFO fair, and, like, she literally uploaded their entire like, you know, strategy docs, earnings docs, like I was watching her do work for them, like, you should not do that, but, and they don't have, like, an enterprise version, chatgpt and whatever.

S Speaker 230:28Yes, yes. They spun out of another company and then that another company had another spin off. We have invested in two of that those companies. So we know the founder quite well.
Yes, yes. They spun out of another company and then that another company had another spin off. We have invested in two of that those companies. So we know the founder quite well.

S Speaker 330:38Okay, got it. Satyam, its founder, he sold his last company to Palo Alto Networks from 200 million. And I don't know if you heard operato. No, I haven't. Okay. So he sold that one to pan W and then he was also a founding engineer at another hot startup that was before my time, tricenta, or something tricentes. But I think they've actually built like, a robust product and that you can actually do like, like, I think a lot of the products in this space are pretty bare bones like, and you can't do like, runtime security, for example. You know, they can actually handle runtime security. And so I think they've built it the right way. They just hire a salesperson. But yeah, I think it's a super interesting space. And so, yeah, that's one. And then the we have a rise as well, if you've heard of that, yes, yes, but that's evals, right?

S Speaker 231:43Yeah, we spoke to a lot of, I would say, evals and guardrails company. Seems like the traction hasn't picked up the way we expected it to be. Maybe a problem that will start to catch up, like a lot of these graphs. When I see that the plans on revenue, it just seems like the hockey growth is going to start now, but we feel we will probably wait and see if we want to make a play there, but AI, governance is more on top of our mind right now. So I just feel like amongst these companies, maybe singular and witness, are a couple of companies that you should you should definitely look at, even Lanai pretty strong dream, but they haven't gad yet. So I can't say a lot. Which one, it's called Lanai, l, a, n, a, i, but yeah, I'm doing a thesis here, Jaya, so I'm happy to forward you some some of our findings there, and I'd love to speak to acuity as well.

If you can make that intro,
S Speaker 332:46yeah, totally. I'll talk to him. I have a check in with him right after this, actually. Yeah, let's do that. I'm curious, like, a lot of the companies in this space have, like, decided to, like, give up as well, you know. So what is your take there? I don't know if you saw any of the ones that had given up. But like, my friend was like, roommates with the lequera founder, which, like, you know, he was like, Shit, I should have Angel invested.
yeah, totally. I'll talk to him. I have a check in with him right after this, actually. Yeah, let's do that.

S Speaker 333:54wedge. Yeah, I agree. I do think that you will find that the acuity product is, like, built differently, which is why it took, like, a much longer time to build, like they were, like, heads down, building it for like, you know, eight months. And so I think, you know, like, what I learned at least a lot about the space talking to other investors, is, like, some of them just fronted that they had, like, certain customers, but they didn't, and then they got sold for a lot of money.

S Speaker 234:46Though, it's probably the same. We don't have to return the fund. So we invest out of the balance sheet, and we in US aim to deploy about 100 $50 million a year. So that's a rough mandate that we have. We don't have to return the capital. So for many investments I've seen, the team has been for 12 years, 13 years with the investment, we don't look at IRRs as much and then some internal metrics on let's just return $30 million for this one investment, things like that.

It's usually one of the partners who gets to sit on the board, but, but I get to see the entire process from end to end. I've sourced a couple of deals in for the company as well. So Great Crash Course, I would say, great entry point into venture and possibly down the line.

S Speaker 339:34Totally Yeah, especially if they haven't. You guys haven't committed to a long term contract with perat yet? I don't think so. No, not yet. Okay, yeah, then, then we should definitely actually talk cool. So okay, so that's one, and then on the job with Ashu, I can give the real quick rundown on that, but yeah, it's basically a partner role that he would want them to take board seats, like pretty soon after. I guess actually, Steve's also hiring for someone as well. So there's another person who's hiring for more of like a principal type person, right? Everyone at foundation is called a partner, though, but yeah, so both of them are hiring. And I think, yeah, the role with Ashu is, I mean, they both have different personalities. Shut up all. She was, like, known to be notoriously, extremely intense. Steve is known to be intense as well, but in a different way, like, you know, he's probably less, he's more hands off. She was very hands on. Interesting. You might get a call from him at 9pm 7am yeah, when you're boarding the plane. When you're getting off the plane. He might know about, you know, and being kind of sarcastic, but also I'm being real. So, yeah, he's intense to work for, but he's he once you make it past the one year mark, right? Yeah, things get smooth.
Totally Yeah, especially if they haven't. You guys haven't committed to a long term contract with perat yet? I don't think so. No, not yet.

S Speaker 242:59for sure, for sure, that's That's amazing. I, in fact, on a separate note, I just wanted to have ask you this question as well. Your growth in venture has been amazing. I've been following your work on LinkedIn for some time, and I see you've been new to the space speaking relative terms, but you've also grown pretty fast. And are there any specific steps, specific channels, networks that you very consciously prioritized.
for sure, for sure, that's That's amazing. I, in fact, on a separate note, I just wanted to have ask you this question as well. Your growth in venture has been amazing.

And are there any specific steps, specific channels, networks that you very consciously prioritized.
S Speaker 343:25Yeah, I would say, like, I look for like anyone, and this is like, I hate speaking in venture speak, but like, really, truly exceptional people. And like that means, like, I take a list of all the IMOs like for each year, from like 1999 to now. And like, I try to, like, meet five people from, like, each class, right? And I'm like, Who is, like, most likely going to be a founder in their network? So it's like, very bottoms up, like, sourcing, or it's like, I go in each single Stanford PhD group and, like, underneath every professor and that, that person that has to tell me who's leaving and what they're thinking about, like, six months in advance, like, and so I just, like, make sure, like, I even moved into Stanford dorms for like, two months and to source. So, like, Yeah, I think a lot of it is just like, hustle like, I've snuck into, like, a lot of different events. Like, the CEO of IBM had, like, a private dinner with, like, the CFO Google. I snuck in. Like, I think it's a little bit of no shame in the beginning, and then now I get invited the proper way. But I think in the beginning was a bit of, like, no shame, ruthless outbounding. Get to know as any as many people as you possibly can that are, like, literally, truly, like, amazing. I go through a lot of roommates, like the cursor founders roommate, I know, I know there are core founders were made like, because these people are around them, but like, and they might get access to some certain deal flow, but you know, they might not be the exceptional person.
Yeah, I would say, like, I look for like anyone, and this is like, I hate speaking in venture speak, but like, really, truly exceptional people.
