S Speaker 20:47That's a really excellent point. Ken at metascale, we have billions of users. Some of this data is their private data, and at the same time, we have hundreds of teams that are owning this data, managing access to this data, and we have 10s of 1000s of engineers that are accessing this data to build the products and services that our users like to use. Ensuring security of data in such a dynamic environment is not only important, but it is also very challenging. And in the rest of this talk, we are going to talk about how we are using agents to address this access management challenge.

S Speaker 11:23So traditionally, we scale out warehouse data access by organizing warehouse into a hierarchical structure. So if we start from the top bottom, and those are tables and the data pipelines producing them and dashboards consuming them, we organize those assets and into projects and managed by uncles, and those projects are load up to teams and all the way to the organization hierarchy. And then we overlay those as in low based access control and over this hierarchy, and together with other dimensions such as data semantics, however, with AI, the efficient access becomes more important, and the scale of the warehouse continues to grow and the complexity of the access path keeps increasing.

S Speaker 24:10So before we dive deeper into any solution, let us just look and look at the key focus on some key concepts. We have two personas on the left hand side we have the data user, and on the right hand side we have the data owner. The job of the data user is to access the data and build the products pipelines and whatever is needed. Job of the data owner is to manage access to the data and safeguard the data. Now to mimic this interaction, our agentic solution also uses two agents. On the left hand side we have a data user agent, and on the right hand side we have the data owner agent. The data user agent is responsible for discovering the data, putting together context and making access request, and data owner agent is responsible for evaluating that request based on context about the data itself, and either approving or denying
