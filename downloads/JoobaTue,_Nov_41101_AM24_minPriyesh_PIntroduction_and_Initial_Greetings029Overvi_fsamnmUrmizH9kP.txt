No, we went to went to school together. Waterloo,
1:43well, Surah, he's a
S Speaker 11:48senior engineering leader at Qualcomm, and AI engineering, and then I personally had very good experience working with people from Waterloo in the past as well. So it's, it's definitely. So here's the thing. I don't know if this is a fit for us or not, but, but since it came highly recommended through Kevin and sarag as like, Okay, gotta talk to this guy, and then we'll see if this is something that we can partner with or not, right? So why don't we do this? I'll give you a quick overview of Cooper mentors. Priyesh is also on the team and and then we'd love to learn more about you, your story. We've got somewhat of an idea about this space, not a whole lot, but we'd love to get your take on it. And so my background, just quickly mentioned. My background is engineering, and this is when I used to work with a lot of people from Waterloo, and it's, it was more income, like I did a whole bunch of things, then camera, computer vision, I spent quite a bit of time and and then I, I've been with, I've been with Qualcomm ventures for eight years, and I manage The North America ventures for Qualcomm mentioned, we invest in multiple regions globally. So we do about one $50 million strategic investment arm for Qualcomm. So we invest one $50 million every year. It's anywhere from two to $10 million initial check size and areas where you like we invest in is like so our chips go into many industries. They obviously go into smartphones, but they go into the cloud. They go in IoT devices and automotive and PCs and xr devices and variables and a whole bunch of things. And then, so what we do is we build in more of the ecosystem around these devices. And then so in many cases, we become their customers. In many cases, we become partners. In many cases, we become like a go to market channel partner for many of the portfolios that we invest in

4:27and so we invest with that in mind.
and so we invest with that in mind.
and so we invest with that in mind.
and so we invest with that in mind.
S Speaker 14:31And so, as you can imagine, an AI recruiting platform would, would more be the story? I mean, the story would be okay. Are we going to use them if they're that good? Because we, I mean, Qualcomm has about over 50,000 engineers, and then most of these engineers are AI these days, the ones that we hire. Are we going to use them? Are we going to enable them through our channel to our partners, or our portfolios and so on, so forth. So that would be, it's a stretch of effect for what we do, but, yeah, but it's worth exploring. I mean, if you're get if you guys are that good,

5:12then yes, we should be using you, but not our recruiting
then yes, we should be using you, but not our recruiting
then yes, we should be using you, but not our recruiting
then yes, we should be using you, but not our recruiting
5:16engine. Yeah, right.
S Speaker 25:19Got it? Got it cool? Yeah, I'll give some background on myself and what we do. Also, my co founder should be joining in a bit, so we don't, like, you don't see a random guy joining, yeah, are you the CEO? He's a CEO. I'm the CTO. Got it Okay, yeah. So, yeah. So, yeah, my name is Baran. I'm originally from Syria. I left when the war started back in 2012 and then I lived in like 12 different countries, learned four languages, then I ended up in Waterloo in 2016 my engineering there, graduated, then I moved later to Silicon Valley. I worked at a company called Essential AI with Ashish maswani. He's like, one of the co authors, of attention is all you need. I built the data infrastructure there for researchers to do expert data experiments for pre training. And then I went to resolve AI, or I built, I worked with AI agents for SRE and infrastructure. My background is also is like, very infrastructure heavy back end and infrastructure heavy. And then along the way I had, I met my co founder, Mark in hacker house in San Francisco, and we both really clicked, and we liked each other, and we have, like, a very complimentary skill set. I'm Syrian, he's Armenian. So we're also, like, culturally adjacent. So we felt like we were a good fit at that time. I was not very like, I was, like, very agnostic about the vertical I want to work on. I just, like, very strong opinions about how I want to use AI in the most effective way to make money nowadays. Yeah, that came from my experience with working at like, the entire stack of AI. So at the central we're doing, like we were building a foundational model. So I've seen, like, how you build a foundational model, and then, after all, it was like a more of an agent tech AI for it, sorry. So I've seen, like, pretty much an entire stack, from from bottom, bottom up, and I along the way, I developed very strong opinions about what are the things that should be done to apply AI most effectively to solve a problem, right? So my only rule was, I want to work on a vertical where I apply how I think AI should be used, as long as the vertical is not slopped. So, like, that is something maybe serious. And then Mark came in. So mark is, he's also an engineer. He worked at figma before, but also he is, like, a micro celebrity on LinkedIn for recruiting. Back in the day, he like, used to, like post about these stuff. Used to make contacts with, like, very famous on LinkedIn for this stuff. He like, gets recognized in the street and as a as, like the LinkedIn guy. Oh, really?
Got it? Got it cool? Yeah, I'll give some background on myself and what we do. Also, my co founder should be joining in a bit, so we don't, like, you don't see a random guy joining, yeah, are you the CEO? He's a CEO. I'm the CTO. Got it Okay, yeah. So, yeah.

7:43What's his full name?
What's his full name?
What's his full name?
What's his full name?
S Speaker 27:51i, y, a n. He's like, more famous along the, like, new grads and stuff and then, and he also shadowed a recruiting agency at some point that's, like, very well known. Spoke TCP, and then when he left, he also had very strong opinions about how inefficient this entire thing is. I wanted to build something so we're, like, Okay, that was very organic. Like, Okay, makes sense that we should work together. So, the way, so this is us now. We're Juba. What is druba? Juba is actually not a recruiting platform. We are a service. So think of us as simply, let's say like your top of funnel agency that is getting new people. That's exactly who we are, but we are just much, much faster and better. So so far, we're working with like few customers. Our biggest one so far is ramp. We were growing, therefore deployed engineering team. We work directly with Rector of engineering there. He gives us like insane feedback. It says that we are like better than anything else that he's ever used before. We also work with Delphi, if you know, like a startup backed by Sequoia series A and they literally, we had three customers say this word by word. I don't know if you're familiar with juice box, just it's like a total tool for for like searching and finding people. It's a tool, not a service. And then there's another platform called paraform, which is now very hot. It's also like for recruiting, and all of them without us even asking said word by word. We are canceling our subscription there, and we just want to use Juba for now, just because simply we cracked, how can we get the quality as fast as possible? And we really kind of escaped the ideological enforcement that you have to build the tool, you have to build the product right? Like, who cares about tool? Who cares a product? If I can solve a problem for you? So we are. We operate as a service. The tech product that you interact with on your end is very simple. It's like, literally, a Slack bot. It goes into your Slack or your teams, and we manage everything in the background for you, from like, searching, ranking, reaching out to people on your behalf. We do, we do on your behalf as well, from either LinkedIn or email, like, either your email will create, like, earliest emails for you and so on. And then when someone is interested, they just, like, literally pop up in your in your Slack channel. And you like accept or reject if you accept like schedules with them. So we also generate like with your calendar and integrate with your ATS to avoid any duplication and so on. So it's just like, you can think of it as like, maximal alignment with the goal of actually getting you someone who's a fit for a job. And that is and if you look at the other solutions out there, which is either like an old school agency is just way too slow, like an old school agent is like, way too slow. It's like, very hindered by people. And the other side of the spectrum is tool, AI tool, like all the shelf tools, and those tools are also very limiting. Those tools are also very limiting because of the technical limitation. And the other reason is they like, you still need to go and put in the work to make it actually work. So in our case, we like, cut through all that fluff and get straight to the point of, like, getting you the most qualified people ever,

We are canceling our subscription there, and we just want to use Juba for now, just because simply we cracked, how can we get the quality as fast as possible? And we really kind of escaped the ideological enforcement that you have to build the tool, you have to build the product right? Like, who cares about tool? Who cares a product? If I can solve a problem for you? So we are. We operate as a service. The tech product that you interact with on your end is very simple. It's like, literally, a Slack bot. It goes into your Slack or your teams, and we manage everything in the background for you, from like, searching, ranking, reaching out to people on your behalf. We do, we do on your behalf as well, from either LinkedIn or email, like, either your email will create, like, earliest emails for you and so on. And then when someone is interested, they just, like, literally pop up in your in your Slack channel. And you like accept or reject if you accept like schedules with them. So we also generate like with your calendar and integrate with your ATS to avoid any duplication and so on. So it's just like, you can think of it as like, maximal alignment with the goal of actually getting you someone who's a fit for a job. And that is and if you look at the other solutions out there, which is either like an old school agency is just way too slow, like an old school agent is like, way too slow. It's like, very hindered by people. And the other side of the spectrum is tool, AI tool, like all the shelf tools, and those tools are also very limiting. Those tools are also very limiting because of the technical limitation. And the other reason is they like, you still need to go and put in the work to make it actually work. So in our case, we like, cut through all that fluff and get straight to the point of, like, getting you the most qualified people ever,
i, y, a n. He's like, more famous along the, like, new grads and stuff and then, and he also shadowed a recruiting agency at some point that's, like, very well known. Spoke TCP, and then when he left, he also had very strong opinions about how inefficient this entire thing is. I wanted to build something so we're, like, Okay, that was very organic. Like, Okay, makes sense that we should work together. So, the way, so this is us now. We're Juba. What is druba? Juba is actually not a recruiting platform. We are a service. So think of us as simply, let's say like your top of funnel agency that is getting new people. That's exactly who we are, but we are just much, much faster and better. So so far, we're working with like few customers. Our biggest one so far is ramp. We were growing, therefore deployed engineering team. We work directly with Rector of engineering there. He gives us like insane feedback. It says that we are like better than anything else that he's ever used before. We also work with Delphi, if you know, like a startup backed by Sequoia series A and they literally, we had three customers say this word by word. I don't know if you're familiar with juice box, just it's like a total tool for for like searching and finding people. It's a tool, not a service. And then there's another platform called paraform, which is now very hot. It's also like for recruiting, and all of them without us even asking said word by word.

So in our case, we like, cut through all that fluff and get straight to the point of, like, getting you the most qualified people ever,
S Speaker 111:12getting us the most qualified people.

S Speaker 211:20So a few things. So first of all, we like, we develop our own like, Custom Search and ranking per role. It's like extremely custom per role. So we get to those people faster, and then we also reach out to them on your behalf. So you get the signal of like, if they're interested or not, very quickly. And then also like we are constantly. It's like almost a very large reinforcement loop, like reinforcement learning environment, where you every feedback that you give about every candidate also gets, like, fed back into the beginning of the pipeline and gets calibrated. So it's like as aligned as you could make it aligned, basically.

S Speaker 111:58And is that alignment for me personally, because, you know, a candidate that I might not like, you know, somebody else might like it,
And is that alignment for me personally, because, you know, a candidate that I might not like, you know, somebody else might like it,
And is that alignment for me personally, because, you know, a candidate that I might not like, you know, somebody else might like it,
And is that alignment for me personally, because, you know, a candidate that I might not like, you know, somebody else might like it,
S Speaker 212:09yeah, yeah. So, so the alignment is actually, we have like a hierarchy of alignment. There's like alignment of the of the candidate, of the company, like, for example, some companies, like in general, regardless of the role, let's say they dislike other companies, they don't want to hire from them. And then there's alignment with the role itself, like, for that specific role you want, like that specific criteria. And then there's the alignment of the hiring manager themselves, right? Like, let's say you specifically in the company have certain like requirements that maybe other people for a same role don't necessarily have. So we our entire system is very portable across each one of those pieces that we can, like, customize, like your your requirements, the company's requirements and and the roles requirements, even to the degree where, like, if, let's say you're working with us as the hiring manager, and like you, you leave to another company and you're like, okay, like, Juba already knows, like my taste and what I care about. You come to us, and we already have that calibrated, you know what I mean? So that's kind of our goal. So it's like achieving maximal alignment with with what you're looking for. And the technology now is at a state where we can afford to have that custom kind of alignment built for each person, each role, each company. Back in the day was very difficult because you were like hindered by the statistical machine learning, where you have to generalize, but now you actually can afford to not generalize and make it as custom
yeah, yeah. So, so the alignment is actually, we have like a hierarchy of alignment. There's like alignment of the of the candidate, of the company, like, for example, some companies, like in general, regardless of the role, let's say they dislike other companies, they don't want to hire from them.

S Speaker 213:39No, no. Juice boxes is purely a tool where you have to go and you have to, like, write down what you're looking for. It does some search for you. Like, literally, it's like, a search on top of the data, yeah, it gives you stuff back. You look at it and and you have, you can rank it. But also the ranking is very limited because, like, if you're a juice box, you're, like, it's a consumer tool, right? And what if I want to use freaking GPT five Pro for my ranking, right? It wouldn't make sense for them. So you're using some, like, bullshit model outside that's only ranking, like top 100 randomly, and then it gets back to you. So it's still a tool we just have to put in the effort to make even that work. And it's also not as efficient as a company,
No, no. Juice boxes is purely a tool where you have to go and you have to, like, write down what you're looking for. It does some search for you.

S Speaker 114:21and how do you make sure, like, what's your data? What's the data base of candidates that you tap into? Yeah, yeah.
and how do you make sure, like, what's your data? What's the data base of candidates that you tap into? Yeah, yeah.
and how do you make sure, like, what's your data? What's the data base of candidates that you tap into? Yeah, yeah.
and how do you make sure, like, what's your data? What's the data base of candidates that you tap into? Yeah, yeah.
S Speaker 214:34So, so the database we like, Data Wise, we have data for all of LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, sometimes Google Scholar, in some cases. So we, like, mix whatever needed.

S Speaker 114:45And these candidates, a lot of times, they're not even looking for jobs, right? Like, it's not like, not

And these candidates, a lot of times, they're not even looking for jobs, right? Like, it's not like, not
S Speaker 214:50necessarily, yeah, not necessarily, no. It's not like, people are looking for a job. We just reach out to them. They feel like passively looking, and we realize that they are. And there's also, like, another sneaky hidden layer there that's very useful is that intelligence that we gather from us reaching out to all of those people, just in sync. Because now, like, let's say I reach out to someone and they reply back. Say, like, for example, for like, a ramp forward deployed, they're like, Okay, thank you. I want to move jobs, but not now, like in July, right? And now we park that, but now in July, if someone else comes to us and they want, like, someone that qualified, we know that this guy's available. Another example is, let's say, for ramp, like, for the fourth quadrolle, they like interview five people. One of them gets an offer, the other four don't get an offer. They still like, still pretty good, right? So we know they're hot, like, we know those people are hot. We know they're pretty good. They just didn't pass wrap. So now we have that very proprietary information that we can use. What other roles could come in and they could it could be a good fit.
necessarily, yeah, not necessarily, no. It's not like, people are looking for a job. We just reach out to them. They feel like passively looking, and we realize that they are.

S Speaker 216:27we it's, like, very core to how we operate, how to use AI, and where to use AI, and where is the human in the loop is involved, and whatnot. So yeah, everything so far has been the two of us, and now, like, after we close our rounds, of course, we want to grow the team because, like, the demand, and we're, by the way, we're still in stealth technically, like, we only have a landing page. We haven't even, like, made an official launch yet, and we're already like this from our, like VC network and like our network in general, we already have so much demand. So the next step is just, like, hire and be able to, like, fulfill all of that demand.

S Speaker 118:23Got it okay? Because for you, like, you know, the large companies, like, large companies like Qualcomm, we've got our own recruiting platforms that we work with. And in order to get you on boarded, I'm sure there's like, a lot of like, okay, no, we're already using something. How do you typically crack? Like, what's your plan to crack large enterprise?

S Speaker 418:48We have less of that for a service based approach. So it's actually one of the things that's effective on the go to market side. Like, we don't need you to do like, a mass scale SaaS rollout to every person at the company and train them to do this platform and so on. It's very easy for us to plug into a given team or an organization that wants to use us, and we act like another teammate on your team. So as soon as we're like a service, our entire like product just operates in Slack. There's a human in the loop in the entire process. So it's much more similar to like hiring a contractor, which doesn't require that much work compared to, let's say, going through all these, like, levels of enterprise security reviews and so on. But like, you did bring a good point. There definitely is, like, a correlation with, like, the much bigger companies have more process and such. Like, our sweet spot is, like, the really high growth stage tech companies, like a company that's crushing you interest rates, like $60 million and their biggest thing is, like, we need to hire like, 100 people in the next, like, few months.

S Speaker 119:44Got it got Okay, that's good. How about like targeted, like, really good. Like, one of my portfolios today said, Hey, we're looking for a VP of operations. And, like, if you have, like, these targeted goals of hiring some key people, is that something else that also works, or your business model really scales with the number of people? No, it

S Speaker 420:10definitely does work. I mean, like, one of the beauties of placement fees is that, like, it's also a percentage of salary, right? So if it takes more work to hire a more executive person, they also get paid more. And so we get paid more. So it kind of like the math checks out for itself. Less of the focus is on like, the executive content roles. But it definitely does work for that, because we basically are just able to find all of the best executives for a given position and then still get in touch with them in a very similar way. I think the only difference for whenever you're hiring like a VP, is that like, let's say, when you're hiring like a mid level IC engineer, like you might have like, an initial screening call, and then just like, immediately put them through an interview process. In the case of like, if you were bringing on, like a VP, it might look a little different, like you might reach out to them in a different way. Like you might reach out and be like, are you willing to, like, grab coffee or something, right? This is like, a much more senior person. So you might not, like, put them through, like, some interview process immediately. You might just go meet them out in the wild and stuff. But the core engine of like, hey, we need to find a person who fits a criteria and high preference and get in touch with them and get them through the door. Like, the core engine for that is the

I don't know if there could be a fit. I'll have to think about it, because, you know, we invest in ecosystem of Qualcomm's chips, so, but I do have, what I can do is our head of forward deployment. I mean, it's a new term now this forward deployment, it's, you know, you know, like people refer to Palantir as forward deployment, you know what Palantir refers to as the first company who started forward deployment? Palantir themselves. It's quopa, yeah. So it's a long story. Why there's been books written about it, why we had to do it. But our Head of Customer engineering, which is head of forward deployment, I want to ask him, if you if he and he's very open to trying new tools. I want to ask him and see if this is something that he would use, and I'm guessing, like your seed round, is it almost done?
