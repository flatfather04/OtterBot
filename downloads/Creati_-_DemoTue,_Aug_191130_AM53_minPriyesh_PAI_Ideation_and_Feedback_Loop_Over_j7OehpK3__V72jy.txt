S Speaker 23:36when you you know that, okay, you went through certain ideation process. And then any ideation process like you, like you shown here, has got a storyline,

elements of UI. And then
elements of UI. And then
elements of UI. And then
S Speaker 23:55which the elements of UI could be a lot of different. Things could be the character, could be the background. Would be question, yeah. Then when you do AB testing,

S Speaker 24:12lot of different things, right? Like depending on output, how are you able to attribute more specifically this was the, this was the element in the training, ideation, LLM I see add a better impact to the click to click through rate, and that's what I change. Yeah, and then a lot of times, if you change that, something else also gets changed. And does it have an impact on like,

S Speaker 28:32question there. You mentioned that you for every retweeting cycle, you go back and update the weights of the model. So I can imagine for different products, the vector would be guided in different directions. So do you have different versions of model? How are you thinking about

S Speaker 311:14Okay? So my skin's been freaking out from all these beach days, and honestly, nothing was working until I found the salicylic acid solution from the ordinary it's only $6 and literally cleared my stress breakouts in days. No fragrance, not sticky, and I can throw it in my bag without worrying about leaks. I apply it right after showering off the salt water, and my pores look way smaller, perfect for when you're constantly sweating and reapplying sunscreen, but still want to look decent in all those spontaneous sunset pics,

S Speaker 111:44so you can see, like, this storyline, it's it's okay, right? And like, it still tell you, like, what is the use case, why you should buy it, and things like that. But it's not that creative. It's not that like, viral idea. So after we give it a lot of feedback, data, and the AI's creativity becomes stronger, and this is what is after.

12:45I think it's here,
S Speaker 212:46but then, okay, so Ella, the key is, see, I don't know which one will work better, but like, do you have data points to support like, before and after, which is CPR,

S Speaker 227:17This was essentially the input that the user gave, in this case, was just the it generated this one. It generated one idea. The idea is to actually generate multiple ideas, right?

S Speaker 127:34Yeah, so actually, I only show one here. In the end, what we'll do is we'll watch it. So what the AI will do is it will generate four ideas at the same time, and then it will generate four ads like, just like the AB testing, you know what I mean, like
Yeah, so actually, I only show one here. In the end, what we'll do is we'll watch it. So what the AI will do is it will generate four ideas at the same time, and then it will generate four ads like, just like the AB testing, you know what I mean, like

S Speaker 227:56simulation to see which one's performing better. I guess your simulation also, the accuracy of the simulator would also have to improve over time. That's true. And then after the simulator, you would actually run based on what the simulator said. Says, These are the three four that are the best. You run these live AB tests, and then refine from there. Okay, so that that's understood. And this you're planning to launch in November,

S Speaker 128:25yes. So what we will do is we launched this first, like the pure AI, like, what do you see here? Maybe, like, this month, end of this month, first, so people get the idea, so you can see the consistency, and the whole the ad script is good, right? Like it is ads that people do get. What is a Nutella selling point? Key things there, and also understand it's a cookie, so people will eat it, or the interaction, right? So we will launch this first, and then what we'll do is we launch the automatic AB testing. And also, you know, like the whole things, like later on, but we will not launch the take rate business model by end of this year. We will only launch the beta testing. Because one thing we do, user interview a lot of users, they are still a little bit worried about, you know, have the whole thing automatically generated by AI and controlled by AI. So what we will first launch is more like a copilot thing, right? Like, like, before you launch the campaign, people still get a lot of decision, do they want it or things like that. But you know, like, we do have 40 users who are more like a pioneer. They are okay to give us a certain budget every day, more like 200 to 400 per day that we can test on the o1 so basically, it's like the AI will automatically running the whole thing. They can monitor the ROI, they can monitor how much money they earn or they lose, right? And then they can say, Okay, I want it to continue or shut it down. So actually, that thing, to be honest, like we tried on our, you know, one of the our users, and we think it's actually better than the human being, because, well,
yes. So what we will do is we launched this first, like the pure AI, like, what do you see here?

S Speaker 230:16so a few things I can go over five minutes. So things to ask from you. One, actually, we'd like to have you pitch to our team as well, so we'll get that set up, whether later this week or early next week, Priyesh can work with you.
so a few things I can go over five minutes. So things to ask from you. One, actually, we'd like to have you pitch to our team as well, so we'll get that set up, whether later this week or early next week, Priyesh can work with you.

30:36The second thing is
S Speaker 131:42personal company? Yeah, so maybe I answer the last one. That's the easiest one first. So we do have organic enterprise or adoption already. We have like Ching cider, Fandango, stalegs and as a group. And we also have affiliate program with a lot of agencies right now, because agencies they have, they have a lot of pressure as well. They also want to use to like that. So what our plan, like, I told you, like in our, like, next year, like early, you know, like before the June, is that once we found this AI agent, could truly, you know, earn money for the business, definitely, I think we will go for enterprise, for sure, because we already have lot of strong interest from the enterprise companies already, but we will do it mainly via like affiliate program for agencies and also doing some, you know, like huge campaigns together with like huge brands, Because I think that will be better or more efficient than the sales speed, right. Because once people know you, they know what the data you have. They know. Let's say, if I already able to earn money for shooting right, I need to run the campaign, or, like in AI automatically. I think that will attract a lot of enterprise automatically, instead of I need to pitch them right? And also agencies, they need tools like us. So I think, yeah,
personal company? Yeah, so maybe I answer the last one. That's the easiest one first. So we do have organic enterprise or adoption already. We have like Ching cider, Fandango, stalegs and as a group. And we also have affiliate program with a lot of agencies right now, because agencies they have, they have a lot of pressure as well. They also want to use to like that.

S Speaker 233:40Got it and so in order. So how do you see, okay, so the next part of the question is, how do you see, where do you see the business end of this year? Where do you see the business end of next year? And then how do you see the revenue split between because, see, there's one more thing to check is it's been 14 to 15 minutes months since you launched the product. Yes, so the the truth is that the
Got it and so in order. So how do you see, okay, so the next part of the question is, how do you see, where do you see the business end of this year? Where do you see the business end of next year? And then how do you see the revenue split between because, see, there's one more thing to check is it's been 14 to 15 minutes months since you launched the product. Yes, so the the truth is that the

S Speaker 234:14at right now is not like I know what I mean. It's not. I don't think we can lean too much into retention today, right? Like, as you can imagine, like most of the customers that you have are on this annual plan anyways, and then, and then, looking at retention, it's very hard to say whether these guys will be, you'll be paying by the end of the end of this year, for example,
at right now is not like I know what I mean. It's not. I don't think we can lean too much into retention today, right? Like, as you can imagine, like most of the customers that you have are on this annual plan anyways, and then, and then, looking at retention, it's very hard to say whether these guys will be, you'll be paying by the end of the end of this year, for example,

34:39right? I see what I mean here. So, so,
right? I see what I mean here. So, so,
right? I see what I mean here. So, so,
right? I see what I mean here. So, so,
S Speaker 234:40so the metric that we're trying to understand is, how do we so? So, I guess one metric to look at for that for us would be engagement
so the metric that we're trying to understand is, how do we so? So, I guess one metric to look at for that for us would be engagement
so the metric that we're trying to understand is, how do we so? So, I guess one metric to look at for that for us would be engagement
so the metric that we're trying to understand is, how do we so? So, I guess one metric to look at for that for us would be engagement
34:50on the product, right? Yeah.
on the product, right? Yeah.
on the product, right? Yeah.
on the product, right? Yeah.
S Speaker 134:51So what we there's two things, right? Like, first, what we see there is,
So what we there's two things, right? Like, first, what we see there is,
So what we there's two things, right? Like, first, what we see there is,
So what we there's two things, right? Like, first, what we see there is,
S Speaker 234:56hold on, let me push my I had to call a founder and let me just text him say, I'll call him in 1015, minutes.
hold on, let me push my I had to call a founder and let me just text him say, I'll call him in 1015, minutes.
hold on, let me push my I had to call a founder and let me just text him say, I'll call him in 1015, minutes.
hold on, let me push my I had to call a founder and let me just text him say, I'll call him in 1015, minutes.
39:31Got it okay? And
S Speaker 239:37I guess, and then on that product. So how do you think about stickiness on the product?
I guess, and then on that product. So how do you think about stickiness on the product?
I guess, and then on that product. So how do you think about stickiness on the product?
I guess, and then on that product. So how do you think about stickiness on the product?
S Speaker 139:42Yeah, so to be honest, that is another very interesting question. Is you the metrics of this alethree product is not how people are going to use it frequently. It's because they don't need to use this, right? Once you connect to your Amazon store, as long as I am able to earn the money for you, you don't need to do anything like I don't even need them to query it, to ask it to run ads, because it will run on its own. So the metrics will not be user sickness anymore. The metrics should be how much percentage of the user we are earning money for them. Let's say, if the matrix is, let's say, even more than 50% then you are winning. Because, you know, those 50% of the user definitely will stay with you because you're earning money for them. No one will trying to get used. Get rid of a tool which is earning money for you, right?
Yeah, so to be honest, that is another very interesting question. Is you the metrics of this alethree product is not how people are going to use it frequently.

40:36What about like, the cost? Like,
What about like, the cost? Like,
What about like, the cost? Like,
What about like, the cost? Like,
S Speaker 240:40how easy would it be to for for someone, for one of your competitors, to copy this because, see, because for a lot of the influencers, the cost of switching, like, if it's automatically running, but if there's other platforms also providing the same, then the cost of switching is lower, and then if they're getting cheaper. Like, you know how I'm saying, like, to the bottom, yes, everybody is trying to out compete each other on price. Yeah. I
how easy would it be to for for someone, for one of your competitors, to copy this because, see, because for a lot of the influencers, the cost of switching, like, if it's automatically running, but if there's other platforms also providing the same, then the cost of switching is lower, and then if they're getting cheaper.

Like, you know how I'm saying, like, to the bottom, yes, everybody is trying to out compete each other on price. Yeah. I
S Speaker 141:09get it. I get it. Yeah. So the thing is that, you know, that's a reason I said this. The ecosystem that the lot of SMB is generating, the as data is so critical and become the moat. The thing is that, let's say today, there come another competitor who want to copy your product. The key is that you really have more, you know, business users on your platform, and who are generating more ad feedback data than them. So your AI is actually able to get a better content, or, I will say, better ROI and CTR content than there, right? So the thing is, user like, if you're if the goal is earning money, the only thing people will compare is whether you get better CPR and ROI compared to other product, right? So as long as you have more data and you have more users on your platform, you always have advantage, you know, over other competitor, because the user will only choose a product that will have better
get it. I get it. Yeah. So the thing is that, you know, that's a reason I said this. The ecosystem that the lot of SMB is generating, the as data is so critical and become the moat.

So as long as you have more data and you have more users on your platform, you always have advantage, you know, over other competitor, because the user will only choose a product that will have better
S Speaker 242:08something I agree, that I agree. But then, essentially, what you're saying is that you have to be forced to market, and then you have to capture a big percentage of users. That's true in order to build a stronger platform. So it's like more of a first mover advantage.
something I agree, that I agree. But then, essentially, what you're saying is that you have to be forced to market, and then you have to capture a big percentage of users. That's true in order to build a stronger platform. So it's like more of a first mover advantage.

something I agree, that I agree. But then, essentially, what you're saying is that you have to be forced to market, and then you have to capture a big percentage of users. That's true in order to build a stronger platform. So it's like more of a first mover advantage.
S Speaker 142:27That's true. I think it's first mover advantage. And also you need to be bottom up. So if someone who only do enterprise, you know, and the key for them is they do not have enough you know, different categories, different demographics, different apps, platform and different products. They do not have that huge data compared to, you know, bottom up companies, so it will be harder for them actually, let's say some some new customer coming in, they may not be able to generate a better enough content for them to have better CPR. So I think the key is the ecosystem, or the data that's generated from this ecosystem, and this, for this ecosystem, you do need, you know, a lot of SMB. And if you want to get those SMB, the first Eugene, you do need a lot of influencers to generate good enough content, right? So I think this is a chance, right? Like it's not, it's not just one point. You need to do it in this way so that you can get more data there. And in the end, we are a data company.
That's true. I think it's first mover advantage. And also you need to be bottom up. So if someone who only do enterprise, you know, and the key for them is they do not have enough you know, different categories, different demographics, different apps, platform and different products. They do not have that huge data compared to, you know, bottom up companies, so it will be harder for them actually, let's say some some new customer coming in, they may not be able to generate a better enough content for them to have better CPR.

S Speaker 143:41oh yeah forecast, or from a from
oh yeah forecast, or from a from
oh yeah forecast, or from a from
oh yeah forecast, or from a from
S Speaker 243:45a cost perspective, from a growth perspective, from a user's perspective, where do you think you're going to be, like, end of this year? Where do you think you're going to be in the next year? Do you have, like, a financial
a cost perspective, from a growth perspective, from a user's perspective, where do you think you're going to be, like, end of this year? Where do you think you're going to be in the next year? Do you have, like, a financial
a cost perspective, from a growth perspective, from a user's perspective, where do you think you're going to be, like, end of this year? Where do you think you're going to be in the next year? Do you have, like, a financial
a cost perspective, from a growth perspective, from a user's perspective, where do you think you're going to be, like, end of this year? Where do you think you're going to be in the next year? Do you have, like, a financial
S Speaker 245:23how long does it do? They close and everything right, like so I love what we so far. We're interested. We want to continue, as you can tell, on the diligence path, there are a few questions that we want to figure out. See, the biggest question in our minds right now is, is in
how long does it do? They close and everything right, like so I love what we so far. We're interested. We want to continue, as you can tell, on the diligence path, there are a few questions that we want to figure out. See, the biggest question in our minds right now is, is in
how long does it do? They close and everything right, like so I love what we so far. We're interested. We want to continue, as you can tell, on the diligence path, there are a few questions that we want to figure out. See, the biggest question in our minds right now is, is in
how long does it do? They close and everything right, like so I love what we so far. We're interested. We want to continue, as you can tell, on the diligence path, there are a few questions that we want to figure out. See, the biggest question in our minds right now is, is in
S Speaker 245:44does the technology itself get commoditized, and then what? What keeps it sticky? Because, in general, I think the market is big. I think, however, for if you have a more prosumer motion, the cost of switching tends to be low. And I understand your answer around this, which is, you have to be the first mover advantage. That's where we have to get some comfort around. And we might get back to you with some questions we have to get some comfort around. And this is where we want to meet your CTO and the technology team and everything. So so that also will give us more comfort around, okay, your product velocity is key. Your being able to build some form of sustainable technology mill over time would be, of course, in this day and age, nobody has a sustainable motion. Even OpenAI doesn't have sustained from a technology standpoint, right? Yeah, but, but, but, I mean, essentially, you have to continue with the product velocity. And we won't understand that funding wise would be or why I'm asking is also choosing the right partners, like what I if I take it for what it's worth, I think choosing the right partner is better than optimizing for valuation at this stage, owning 1% less or 2% less of a billion dollar company is is way more important than owning more of a smaller company. So choosing the partners well would be important. And then in this space, as you can imagine, dollars raised ends up becoming moat as well, because then you can run faster in many cases, right? So, so the question is that, how, how will you be able to attract more dollars into the company, maybe six months from now, or, like, you don't need the money, that's fine, but, but the fact is that you need in order for you to continue on that R D motion, continue to build this stronger brand, you have able to attract more capital because your competitors are Yeah, like in this space, nothing stops like captions started out, I don't know if you know the story of captions. Captions started out as two guys putting an ad together on a putting it on an Android Play Store or something iOS Play app store. And then Monday morning, they wake up and they see a lot of a lot of like traction, and they said, oh, let's build a company. And so they ended up building the company. And then the company is, is actually growing really, really fast. And then the thing is, they've been able to attract a lot of capital, so that continue to add a lot of features. So so they, like a lot of the other competitors, in other spaces, they will continue to draw concentric circles, right in terms of product, as you can see, like this, even in other productivity tool space, that's the same thing that's happening. So how we, I think that's those are the key things that we want to focus on as we Yeah, choosing the great partners, that's why, like, what type of investors are you able to attract today, and then do they have the prop pockets for the next rounds?
does the technology itself get commoditized, and then what? What keeps it sticky? Because, in general, I think the market is big. I think, however, for if you have a more prosumer motion, the cost of switching tends to be low. And I understand your answer around this, which is, you have to be the first mover advantage.
