S Speaker 14:22particularly, I am looking at a lot of different spaces. I wouldn't say we have a defined focus. At times we go opportunistically with a thesis in a few areas. So last year, we took very strong look at voice AI, then AI for knowledge work, we made an investment in that space in a company called context, and another partner of ours, Nan, she is very actively looking at video AI solution. So we spoke to almost all of the video generation foundation model companies and also the application companies in that space. So we have good sort of surface area to sort of compare companies with in that space, as well rack solutions, a lot of enterprise ai mlops solutions. So quite a weighted interest. I would say. Ella, yes.

Hey, beautiful people, welcome back to my Channel.
S Speaker 113:46and Ella, just, just as a clarification for this workflow, so you have a set templatized number of models. The brand gives their own product information, and you contextualize the entire video based on the brand's guidelines you scrape it through the web is, Am I understanding the workflow correctly here?
and Ella, just, just as a clarification for this workflow, so you have a set templatized number of models.

S Speaker 214:06Yeah. So basically, it's like, you know, like the creators or the influencers, they will create something like a template or creation, right? Like the video once, then the brands and the business, they just upload their product. And then you can, let's say, for example, right? Like this influencer, he created some place, like, to turn for perfume company, right? To turn the perfume into a pill pack, or, like a capsule or a mini perfume. So then there comes, like the purse company, right? So you can make it into, like a purse. Then you can, there's a shoe company, you can turn it into shoe, and they only need to upload the product, yeah. And then you can adapt this creation to all kinds of business. And, you know, like, the problem here is, a lot of people is asking, Okay, Ella, like, why, you know, like, pick up, or, like, other companies, like, why we don't have that adaptive creation before, right?
Yeah. So basically, it's like, you know, like the creators or the influencers, they will create something like a template or creation, right?

S Speaker 115:02And Ella will come to that. I think that's a very interesting point, but just another clarification the previous one. So you who is sort of at this point deciding on which templates would be on the platform, which influences would be selected. Is it creative?
And Ella will come to that. I think that's a very interesting point, but just another clarification the previous one. So you who is sort of at this point deciding on which templates would be on the platform, which influences would be selected. Is it creative?

S Speaker 117:05interesting. And so from a GTM and user acquisition perspective, I believe you have a flywheel. Are you trying to acquire influencers and then use them to acquire businesses, or are you trying to do both?
interesting. And so from a GTM and user acquisition perspective, I believe you have a flywheel. Are you trying to acquire influencers and then use them to acquire businesses, or are you trying to do both?
interesting. And so from a GTM and user acquisition perspective, I believe you have a flywheel. Are you trying to acquire influencers and then use them to acquire businesses, or are you trying to do both?
interesting. And so from a GTM and user acquisition perspective, I believe you have a flywheel. Are you trying to acquire influencers and then use them to acquire businesses, or are you trying to do both?
S Speaker 217:20Yeah, so very good question. You're right. So the thing is, like, because it have two sides, right? You have the influencer side and you have the business side. The key to attract business side is like, what we said is you need to use the viral content on the social media to attract them. But the first place, you need the influencer side by the Creator side, right? You need them as well. So we originally thought, Okay, we just email those creators. Email, code, email, reach out. But that's super slow, and that is real expensive, because you only need you have few creators. So what we do is, actually, we found on our mobile side, we create a creator tab, you know. And what we found is we have our, you know, several creators in our community to create, also, you know, creations or templates for influencers as well, to attract them. And that is the best way, because, you know, all influencers and creators, they also need to, you know, do their own marketing, right, because they also need to attract the followers. They need the traffic as well. So what we do is, we found the best way is we also create some templates and video, you know, like, you know, like the creations, adaptive creation for themselves as well, so they can upload their own face, and, you know, have their own face turn into really cool effects. And that way is the like, you know, the easiest way and the quickest way that we get a lot of creator community in very short time. So it's, you're right. You need to first create the Creator marketplace using those templates, and then you will turn those creators into your community. We sign them, you know, like a theme, or kind of like assignments every two weeks. So they will create a lot of templates, and then you use that to attract a lot of business.
Yeah, so very good question. You're right. So the thing is, like, because it have two sides, right? You have the influencer side and you have the business side.

S Speaker 119:09Very interesting. And Ella from, I know you would have a traction slide, but from an influencer, traction side, which? Which influences do you have on the platform? What's their following like today,
Very interesting. And Ella from, I know you would have a traction slide, but from an influencer, traction side, which? Which influences do you have on the platform? What's their following like today,
Very interesting. And Ella from, I know you would have a traction slide, but from an influencer, traction side, which? Which influences do you have on the platform? What's their following like today,
Very interesting. And Ella from, I know you would have a traction slide, but from an influencer, traction side, which? Which influences do you have on the platform? What's their following like today,
S Speaker 219:22yeah. So basically, to be honest, like we have influencer or creators from all over the world and but mainly as we have a standard how we filter them out, right? So we have about, like 30k influencers in our, you know, like home community. But not everyone have a follower. Like, we need a follower more than 50k to 500k like, depending on their creativity. Because, like I said, not every influencer or creator, they are creative, like some of them, they do have, you know, like followers, but not they are not very good at using AI tools to create the templates, right? Some of them, they are creative, but they do not have enough followers. So in the end, from the 30k influencers, we filter out 6k of them, which we think they have, like, decent amount of followers. And also they are great at great content, and they create a lot of, you know, like templates, you know, like, you know, frequently, and we use this, you know, like, viral, viral thing, to filter out whether those templates are good enough. And we try to update the templates, you know, very frequently our platform. And yeah, hope that answers your question, yeah, yeah, yeah. And one very important thing, actually, I haven't covered before, is, you know, adaptive creation. Like, how do we adaptive, right? And why cannot other companies do the adaptive? So, you know, the important thing, actually, is a consistency, right? So if we, if we are selling cold, comes chips, it's the same thing, right? If I am holding a chip. And if that cheap like I am sending in my video is different from exactly what the chip looks like in the in the real product, then I cannot use that. It's not like, Okay, you have 60% or eight likes, not like 60 score or 280 score. It's like zero to one, right? It's good or not usable at all. But the problem you see is, let me give you example, right? There are so many, you know. Let's take this Jable Bluetooth speaker for example. Like this is the product itself. And let me show you what is crazy spreads out
yeah. So basically, to be honest, like we have influencer or creators from all over the world and but mainly as we have a standard how we filter them out, right?

S Speaker 134:08just, just to follow up questions on the feedback loop. Ella, so would you say, is it? Is it? Is it fair to say that the improvements in CDR, conversions, impressions for one particular ad, for one brand, for one product, is it transferable to a lot of other brands? So yes.

S Speaker 136:41understood and have you done any like, do you have customers where you have sort of gone through the entire feedback loop improve the product? And have you done any studies or metrics? Have you tracked metrics to say that the feedback loop is actually working in the CTR rates, or some of these metrics are increasing,

S Speaker 237:03yes, so this is my next slide. So basically we, like, we have a lot of results from the DC brands, from a lot of lean as startup, and also the influencers. And what we found is they have at least 20% increase in the click through rate using that thing, and we have over 16 point 93 percentage of watch time increase for after using the credit and also double the success rate of new SKU testing. I will explain a little bit about the success rate

S Speaker 240:32I discovered right? So the thing is, like before, for the business, they only have this product photo, yeah, this t shirt that is not that agent right now, they turn it into a video, right? And have the influencer and people like, Oh, this is so persuasive that people definitely love that. So

Hello, can you hear me? Yeah. I think Chris, if you want to talk to you about some questions,
S Speaker 141:12yeah, one quick question. Sorry about that. Sorry for breaking your flow. But one, one quick question. There a lot of upcoming startups are really working on creating a personal stylist in a similar fashion, the problem that I think that they are trying to solve, essentially, is, how do you take a picture from a product picture, and how do you sort of morph it across different body types, different model types? How are you approaching this problem? How are you sort of solving it? Because on the video, it seemed like you, you've cracked it pretty well.
yeah, one quick question. Sorry about that. Sorry for breaking your flow. But one, one quick question.

S Speaker 241:48Yeah. So we are actually quite different from those. We call them virtual try on companies. Yeah, right. Like we are not virtual tryouts, so it's not for specific certain customer to try on this clothes. We are more on the business side. So you can think about, is everyone. Our business side is just a AI model, right? It's a perfect body shape, and she just need to, you know, like to show the users, oh, like, like, just like, the model, like, this clothes is super beautiful. Led them to envision, like, what is that, right? So I will see the technology difficulty is kind of different there, or yeah, now the problem is different, because for virtual try on, you definitely need to understand the body shape of the customer specifically, and then understand how the clothes will fit on different body shape, right? But instead, really, we are just doing ads, you know, for ads and marketing, you just imagine that person is perfect body shape. So I don't need to deal with that issue, because the only thing we think about their body shape, they are perfect
Yeah. So we are actually quite different from those. We call them virtual try on companies. Yeah, right.

S Speaker 142:56models. Yeah? So that makes sense, yeah, yeah. That makes sense. It's a good shortcut to have Ella. So on the platform, I also say that you have an option of uploading your own model. So when you do that, how do you sort of go across this problem in that case,
models. Yeah? So that makes sense, yeah, yeah. That makes sense. It's a good shortcut to have Ella. So on the platform, I also say that you have an option of uploading your own model. So when you do that, how do you sort of go across this problem in that case,

S Speaker 243:13yeah, so for uploading your own model, basically, it's a steel we believe that is a perfect body shape, right? We, like, you can think about something like, we imagine all the models, or no matter like. So one thing that's very important, let me show you one thing we do have a sense of, really, you know, like curved model compared to, you know, like very thin models. Like, we have something like that. Let's say she is a very curved model, right? We will know how the clothes will fit her. But besides that, we, you know, like, normally is that we do not really focus on the body specifics, whether you have, you know, like, like, like, yeah, like, a different curve or different shape. But the thing is, like, for we do have different categories. Let's say if you are really slim, or if you are really curved, there's different like, the algorithm will take care of that. But we do not really understand, you know, like the body shape. We just trying to, you know, demo the clothes on a perfect person or perfect model to make for the ads. Yes, only thing that's important is make it perfect so people can envision, like, Okay, if I am that model, if I wear that clothes, I will be super, you know, beautiful. Beautiful,

44:43yeah, totally makes sense. Yes, get that.
yeah, totally makes sense. Yes, get that.
yeah, totally makes sense. Yes, get that.
yeah, totally makes sense. Yes, get that.
S Speaker 244:47Yeah, okay, yeah. So, like, like I said, is that I think, like, we at pretty, we take really, you know, like, a different approach, right, compared to virtual trial, or compared to other, I think market companies, right? We take a bottom up and we, we believe in the future, you know, like, we use the creator community really grow fast. Have over 1 million for, you know, like may revenue say, more than 10% month to month growth. And we see, you know, on our desktop, we have 90% retention rate for the next month for our mobile app, we see over 70% long tail for the whole like, retention for the weekly subscribers and annually subscribers on the on the weekly, sorry, on the mobile and one thing that we also saw is that, you know, like, Like you said, they are, they are so many different, you know, like, AI video companies, right? Like they are virtual. Try on, I saw there's a lot of AI product image, right? Like you just upload the product, it will generate the background of the image for you. There are also a lot of the video tools, but I will see pretty is the only one that will have the consistency and generate the marketing video for people. Because, you know, like, I think you have heard of icon. And have you heard of icon?
Yeah, okay, yeah. So, like, like I said, is that I think, like, we at pretty, we take really, you know, like, a different approach, right, compared to virtual trial, or compared to other, I think market companies, right?

I have heard of creative. I not icon, though. Oh,
I have heard of creative. I not icon, though. Oh,
I have heard of creative. I not icon, though. Oh,
S Speaker 246:18okay, icon. They are actually pretty famous, like they are backed by Peter tail, yeah, they are like aI ads company as well. The they also have influencers like marketplace, but on the other side is that their influencer is real influencers, so their marketplace is more like, I have a group of influencers. I have a group of brands, but I will have the influencer really make a video for the brands. Like, just like the traditional way, one to one, right? So it's like traditional marketplace, and they are more focused on, you know, generating the poster for a product. But the thing is, like, you know, like, their product is very hard to use. I feel like they actually do have the digital avatar thing, something like that. Like digital avatar and their, you know, like their solution is something like, prettify, using the talking heads. So some people, like, do not understand, like, what is the difference between the talking heads and the generative AI video solution? I will give you example.
okay, icon. They are actually pretty famous, like they are backed by Peter tail, yeah, they are like aI ads company as well.

S Speaker 247:50yeah? So you can see, this is from like, a digital avatar or cultural head technology, yeah? Just like, Hey Jim, you know, hey James. Yeah. The problem for them is they are not for marketing, you know, they cannot wear the clothes, they cannot hold the product. It's more like a green screen style, yeah, we see that the CTR definitely, you know, like lower, too many, too much, compared to really generative, you know, immersive content. I will see, like, technology wise, that's different, yeah, and yeah. And also it's like we are more like a community of ideation of creators, right? So we believe the creators are the key for our platform, and that's the reason we, you know, keep that, you know, using our templates to attract more creators, and we just trying to, you know, build the marketplace there to scale the creators creatively compared to all of others. They are mainly just, you know, building a tool, right? So it's kind of, I will see it's different user interface and using experience,
yeah? So you can see, this is from like, a digital avatar or cultural head technology, yeah? Just like, Hey Jim, you know, hey James. Yeah.

It's more like a green screen style, yeah, we see that the CTR definitely, you know, like lower, too many, too much, compared to really generative, you know, immersive content. I will see, like, technology wise, that's different, yeah, and yeah. And also it's like we are more like a community of ideation of creators, right? So we believe the creators are the key for our platform, and that's the reason we, you know, keep that, you know, using our templates to attract more creators, and we just trying to, you know, build the marketplace there to scale the creators creatively compared to all of others. They are mainly just, you know, building a tool, right? So it's kind of, I will see it's different user interface and using experience,
yeah? So you can see, this is from like, a digital avatar or cultural head technology, yeah? Just like, Hey Jim, you know, hey James. Yeah.

S Speaker 148:54right? And Ella, how do you price this? Price the model today, and how's the business model between the influencers create and the brand?
right? And Ella, how do you price this? Price the model today, and how's the business model between the influencers create and the brand?
right? And Ella, how do you price this? Price the model today, and how's the business model between the influencers create and the brand?
right? And Ella, how do you price this? Price the model today, and how's the business model between the influencers create and the brand?
S Speaker 249:05Yeah, very good question. So for the business model, you know, like we on our website, we have, you know, like monthly subscription from $39 to $200 depending on how many video or how many credits you need? Yeah, our mobile side, we have annually subscription and weekly subscription, you know, like on the on the mobile app, it's, it's pretty interesting, as a lot of people, they have weekly subscription instead of monthly subscription. And mainly it's like, it's better to you to, you know, analyze the churn and, you know, like, whether the product should go to a better way. So it's like, so for our mobile side, we have weekly subscription of 6.99 per week, and we have annually subscription of 35 per year. But then we trying to guide all the, you know, like the business from the mobile side to our desktop side, because on the mobile side, it's very easy for us to, you know, acquire users, yeah, really low acquisition cost, but we want to upsell them using our desktop. So that's how we are doing, right?
Yeah, very good question. So for the business model, you know, like we on our website, we have, you know, like monthly subscription from $39 to $200 depending on how many video or how many credits you need?

So that's how we are doing, right?
S Speaker 150:11And is the mobile app in terms of feature different from the web app? And how's that? So,
And is the mobile app in terms of feature different from the web app? And how's that? So,
And is the mobile app in terms of feature different from the web app? And how's that? So,
And is the mobile app in terms of feature different from the web app? And how's that? So,
S Speaker 152:39right? Very interesting. Ella, I think, I think it's a pretty interesting proposition. I'd love to have a chat with the team. Get back to you on where we stand, but certainly quite interesting. Happy to lean in as well. How are you in terms of raising this round? Where will this get you? And have you raised a round previously? Who are the large packers?
right? Very interesting. Ella, I think, I think it's a pretty interesting proposition. I'd love to have a chat with the team. Get back to you on where we stand, but certainly quite interesting. Happy to lean in as well. How are you in terms of raising this round? Where will this get you? And have you raised a round previously? Who are the large packers?

Happy to lean in as well. How are you in terms of raising this round? Where will this get you? And have you raised a round previously? Who are the large packers?
S Speaker 253:03Yeah, yeah. So for this one is our Series A, and we're raising 10 million of Series A, and we already have 5 million committed. So we are looking for like rest of COVID or follow. And for our previously, we raised 7 million in total. We raised two rounds before our first round, we raised 2 million, and our second round we raised 5 million. So our last round valuation is 15 million.
Yeah, yeah. So for this one is our Series A, and we're raising 10 million of Series A, and we already have 5 million committed. So we are looking for like rest of COVID or follow. And for our previously, we raised 7 million in total. We raised two rounds before our first round, we raised 2 million, and our second round we raised 5 million.

S Speaker 153:32Okay, and have you priced the current round?
Okay, and have you priced the current round?
Okay, and have you priced the current round?
Okay, and have you priced the current round?
S Speaker 253:37A current round right? Right now we get like because we have term sheet from the lead, we have also some follower term sheet and our lead term sheet, the valuation is 100 mil. We have some full term sheet, like, we have, like, 80, sorry, 80 mil as well. So I think, like, we are flexible at the pricing side. The main thing that we are more you know, care about is what kind of investor we are property with, yeah, and what kind of, like resources they can bring to us, right? Like I mentioned before, I'm really interested in that age computing thing because, you know, we have lot of friends on our mobile app site. They need to generate a lot of, you know, like the content, like the ads. There. Also, like, really bad, you know, like viral hooks there, and our mobile site is really, I would say it's kind of slow for us. It will take us longer to do that. So if we could do the age computing. Because, you know, one thing we found is lot of, you know, like eBay, Etsy, lot of those smaller, I will see brands, they do not they like. They take the photo of their product on the phone directly, not using a professional camera. So the whole workflow actually is happening on the mobile side and the mobile app instead of, you know, on the desktop. So we see there's a huge new opportunity there on the edge computing. And really love to you know, like, talk about the collaboration there that's possible in the future.
A current round right? Right now we get like because we have term sheet from the lead, we have also some follower term sheet and our lead term sheet, the valuation is 100 mil.

S Speaker 155:06Yeah, absolutely. I had a recent chat with the mobile business units, and they are quite excited about the space. They also feel the next chipset that we will be launching sometime later this year in a few months or so, would have very extended capabilities that we can run a lot of these models on edge at the moment. Ella, which models are you using? What's the model size? Roughly, so I can figure out if that works for the device or not.
Yeah, absolutely. I had a recent chat with the mobile business units, and they are quite excited about the space.

Ella, which models are you using? What's the model size? Roughly, so I can figure out if that works for the device or not.
S Speaker 255:35Yeah, definitely. So right now, we are running like both clean and you agree, yeah, but like, we can, like, you know that to any like, aof in our architecture, because we are quite flexible. But like, like, you are right? The thing is, our small model is actually pretty small, so you don't need to really worry about that.
Yeah, definitely. So right now, we are running like both clean and you agree, yeah, but like, we can, like, you know that to any like, aof in our architecture, because we are quite flexible.

S Speaker 256:08Yeah, they tell like, like, they tell us to trying to keep it like, you know, like, still confidential before, absolutely, the round is both. But they are like, a US local investors. They invest in a lot of like robotics and AI startup, and they also invest in SpaceX before
Yeah, they tell like, like, they tell us to trying to keep it like, you know, like, still confidential before, absolutely, the round is both. But they are like, a US local investors. They invest in a lot of like robotics and AI startup, and they also invest in SpaceX before
Yeah, they tell like, like, they tell us to trying to keep it like, you know, like, still confidential before, absolutely, the round is both. But they are like, a US local investors. They invest in a lot of like robotics and AI startup, and they also invest in SpaceX before

S Speaker 156:28interesting. That's that's great, Ella, thanks a lot for the conversation. I really enjoyed it. There's a lot of potential collaborations that I can think of. Let me is there, is there a timeline that you're looking at in terms of closing, and do you have, like, a hard set for for the final closing?
interesting. That's that's great, Ella, thanks a lot for the conversation. I really enjoyed it. There's a lot of potential collaborations that I can think of.

S Speaker 256:48Yeah, so we hope to, you know, you know, like, like, we talked to different investors, and we are hoping to, you know, close it, I will see, like, soon. But we don't have a very hard deadline to be honest, right? The thing is, like, it's more important for us to find the right investor, but our currently, our plan of timeline is maybe, like, in three weeks, we're trying to, you know, like, at least finalize the architecture.
Yeah, so we hope to, you know, you know, like, like, we talked to different investors, and we are hoping to, you know, close it, I will see, like, soon.

58:11Thanks a lot. You
58:13actually have one more question please, yeah. I'm very curious. What is

actually have one more question please, yeah. I'm very curious. What is
actually have one more question please, yeah. I'm very curious. What is
S Speaker 358:18like your process of investing? Like, how is that work? Is that Yeah? Is that the company,
like your process of investing? Like, how is that work? Is that Yeah? Is that the company,
like your process of investing? Like, how is that work? Is that Yeah? Is that the company,
like your process of investing? Like, how is that work? Is that Yeah? Is that the company,
S Speaker 158:24yeah? Typically, our process takes about three to four weeks from the first meeting to actually wiring the money. Fiona, the process internally is that we have a discussion in an im meeting, which is usually US based investors, and then we have a stage discussion, which involves the geo leads for all of regional offices. Post that we put it to a vote, and we have an IC meeting where we present the opportunity to some of the business units internally. But that's mostly, I would say, just a compliance process in a way. So that's, that's how we do it, in a two step process. But happy to answer any pointed questions, if you have around

S Speaker 359:09that. Oh, great, great. Yeah, I think I'm okay here. It's just time to learn more. And I feel like we work. I actually, me personally work with the VR team, because the play for dream. I don't know if you know this company right now. We are, you know, as another portfolio company we have. Yeah, I think we work with you guys too. So it's a very small world. Oh,
