S Speaker 14:17That's That's correct, yeah. And these are all kind of separate examples from kind of different customers, but in terms of kind of you know what their experience is, but if you if you improve the dive, you know drivers, you know risk trading, that leads to a reduction in accidents,

S Speaker 34:43reduce because I think, I think it produced the short term, what I have been tracking on the industry, like companies, like some server or they usually show like, the number of alerts the camera, the camera is June, and usually is like after you install in one month, but usually reduce a lot the number of alerts. And then, of course, I think the end result is reducing the number of pest events as well. So that part of the value prop, I think it's a reduced from,

S Speaker 15:14yeah, and in the exit, in the Amazon example, right? It did reduce accidents by 50% that's a that's a big number regardless, right? And even on top of that, you know, the being able to exonerate drivers, I think, is very interesting. I think samsara did a really good post around two years ago. Yeah, that over of the video, you know, footage of the cameras in their you know, telematics system, the 50% of the drivers use that footage to exonerate them once a year, right? That's a that's a really big number as far as kind of fleet performance and and fleet safety value both to the driver and value to to the fleet itself, right? So, I mean, it correlates with it, but it's not one to one.

S Speaker 36:16I have one other question, just trying to understand for the customers that nowadays they buy only the camera solution. Do they access like the data or the insights on on platform, or are they integrating that information on the grid management platform they're using right now. So just geotech, for example.

S Speaker 16:45So which data? I'm sorry, I think those are two different
So which data? I'm sorry, I think those are two different

S Speaker 36:50just like the videos, like the alerts, like the scoring system of the drivers, everything

just like the videos, like the alerts, like the scoring system of the drivers, everything
7:25They're not pulling
S Speaker 37:31kind of the data. When you say about like the partnership you're doing with Geotab, can you just give like more details on what is going to be done by nettradment, what's going to be done by Geotab?

S Speaker 17:45Sure. Yeah. So there's a whole host of fleet management workflows, like, you know, GPS, you know, tracking of, you know, stuff in the cab compliance, hours of service, workflows, things like that, some, some that are mandated by regulars regulators, some that are asked for by the end customer. So to provide a complete solution that covers both the safety and operational efficiencies, if you had the full solution. You're providing a full an all in one solution, right? So metrodyne does the video safety portion of that, right? And anything that comes from from a camera, geo tab through the back end integration handles all the other workflows over time. You know, it's true, metrodyne will move further into that to provide their all their own all in one solution. So they'll be competing with natural Dyne, with nitrogen, with Geotab over time, because they that those part portions are largely commodities, right? So if you think of EDL, electronic data logging. That was a requirement that came out, pushed by the government around two years, four years ago, and everyone had to move from pen and paper to tracking hours of service. But digitally, there are, if you go on to any of the if you go to platform science, if you go to Geotab, you go to any of these, you can find a list of probably 100 maybe 200 EDL providers, right? These are kind of commodity goods. It's a requirement, but at the end of the day, the video part is the more challenging piece to sell.
Sure. Yeah.

S Speaker 39:37I agree. And maybe just one last comment on the product, I think it's important to see how fast the management is able to come with new features based on the data they're getting from the cameras I just saw yesterday or the day before that. SMSA route, something just like to measure the height of regions. And then they can do like a real time alerts to to let drivers know if the trucks are able to go under the bridges. And the reason they did that was for one specific customer from the UK. So I think just checking how fast they're able, because I think innovation is going to be crucial like to be like the leading solution in Dash cams. So maybe this is something that you want to check, just to be sure that they are not only following the market but also coming with creative solutions to their customers,

S Speaker 110:29correct? Yeah, and we'll get into into more of that as well. There's a lot of you know, money and research being spent at the company too, since they are a video first platform. They're bringing a lot of products to market that are more a s like features, right? So collision avoidance and things like that, things that will ultimately be integrated into, you know, into OEMs products and be purely software. But I don't have a good answer for the speed of some of those products. So they've clearly developed a whole suite of products today. But for the future, I can get to a better roadmap on kind of time to market for those

S Speaker 411:21So today it's an aftermarket product. But is there a future where the OEM started integrating some of these products or cameras in the vehicle when they ship out a factory, and will that be a threat to businesses, not just this, but any other similar kind of business models that are there at

S Speaker 111:43SAFTA market. There is, it's very early days for that. Candid lirama. They have a couple of interesting discussions going on, but this is part of the roadmap. So today, as we understand that, they're in talks with guys like rivian, guys like Volvo, you know, where these cameras will already, as you're saying, be embedded in these solutions from the OEM right to leverage Net Zero dimes software only to be deployed in those for, you know, pedestrian warnings, collision avoidance, All those as like features that will be powered by by netrodyne, but ultimately the hardware would be integrated from from the OEM. Still, early days, and obviously,

Still, early days, and obviously,
S Speaker 412:29you know, yeah, I think it's early days because I think the cost of the cameras for netrady is quite expensive, right? I don't know the OEMs are willing to put that in and mark up their, you know, retail prices or
you know, yeah, I think it's early days because I think the cost of the cameras for netrady is quite expensive, right? I don't know the OEMs are willing to put that in and mark up their, you know, retail prices or

S Speaker 112:48So that might be an issue, yes. And I mean, and it's still a long road, if you take a look at the, you know, and we'll get into it on the market side, but the, you know, current connected fleet today, 20 years after, you know, all these IoT devices and stuff, you know, start penetrating the fleet market. We're still only half penetrated on connected fleets, even in the US, which is, you know, probably the leader, Europe's behind it, with like, a third of the of the fleet. So by the time Adas comes out, you know, all the fleets, that'll be a long road. It's an important part of the roadmap, but it's definitely, I would say, likely, outside of a venture, venture window. So there's a lot Greenfield opportunity with that. But equally, when you're looking at these solutions, there's a huge, you know, brownfield market. What we're looking at the existing solutions, as well as, you know, new Greenfield opportunities in just video loan. So yes, that that is a leg to the market. It's one that they're in discussions with, already with a handful of OEMs. But I see that as a longer, longer play. It's where the market is going. Clearly, you need to be ahead of it and kind of, you know, construct your business directly around it, but it's a longer term loan. Thank
So that might be an issue, yes.

S Speaker 414:03you. So one other question on this slide, so since they've delivered such kind of metrics to Amazon, is there any reduction in the premiums at Amazon for those fleets? Have they reported any kind of insurance premium productions, which is the ultimate proof point given, right?

S Speaker 317:42We analyze the company from Israel, UPI, that was doing a vehicle visual inspections, and they had a deal with farmers zone. It was pretty much the same. We can compare notes, just to make sure that Metro dime made a great deal with Amazon, comparing to that other one. So but if you could provide details, just I would like to check how are like the key terms of that deal with Amazon. I think it's always relevant to see what you're doing. In the case of UB, I just wanted to know it was based on success. So once the part with Amazon rule, then they receive it like more important So, but let's double check and we can compare notes. Thank you. Yep, Michelle, it's

From that standpoint, it's essentially like close to 6x this year's AI, which seems lower for a company that is growing well, for a market that has lots of room to grow, three players can exist. And I guess there's one risk that they have over 40% Amazon as one customer. So why have they and then? And then, I believe this is an insider led rock, right? This is an insider led rock, correct? So why, like, typically, for or for a company on this profile, they should be able to get a lot of external investors. So what's the cash

S Speaker 120:43I Quinn correct me if I'm wrong. I think they did receive external term sheets, but it wasn't as strong. And you're correct, that's interesting. But you know, again, on the valuation, I don't think I would look at the 200 million Right? Like trading off of ARR, if you look at this slide real quick, I just jumped forward. You know, they're doing around 120 million of revenue, right? And the the more accurate
I Quinn correct me if I'm wrong. I think they did receive external term sheets, but it wasn't as strong. And you're correct, that's interesting.

S Speaker 121:22so, yes, I mean, still, you know, within the range, but it's, you know, kind of, you know, 15x or, you know, 14x
so, yes, I mean, still, you know, within the range, but it's, you know, kind of, you know, 15x or, you know, 14x

S Speaker 121:38more like C, A, R, R, right? This still has to convert. It's a it's a good idea, yeah, this is booked. Arr, this is, you know, recognizable, Arr, and then obviously the true metric is conversion to revenue, right? So they still have one $20 million revenue.
more like C, A, R, R, right? This still has to convert. It's a it's a good idea, yeah, this is booked. Arr, this is, you know, recognizable, Arr, and then obviously the true metric is conversion to revenue, right? So they still have one $20 million revenue.

So Trisha this thing, I think the
So Trisha this thing, I think the
S Speaker 522:04revenue is a better metric here. So they're trading roughly at 10x LTM, that's the valuation metric. I think, yeah, right, roughly.
revenue is a better metric here. So they're trading roughly at 10x LTM, that's the valuation metric. I think, yeah, right, roughly.
revenue is a better metric here. So they're trading roughly at 10x LTM, that's the valuation metric. I think, yeah, right, roughly.

22:40my guess is, would be,
my guess is, would be,
my guess is, would be,
my guess is, would be,
S Speaker 522:41is you have a, you have a large competitor, which means samsara, right? And then there's, there's this market big, but there's competition, right? You have motive to their a bit, maybe there, I don't know the revenue motive, but there are, there are competitions, especially if they try to go down market, their enterprise is done well, right? But if they try to penetrate the mid market, it ain't going to run into snapshot even more. Yeah,
is you have a, you have a large competitor, which means samsara, right? And then there's, there's this market big, but there's competition, right?

S Speaker 223:15that's right. So, so, and we believe that within the enterprise segment, they have good headroom to grow,
that's right. So, so, and we believe that within the enterprise segment, they have good headroom to grow,
that's right. So, so, and we believe that within the enterprise segment, they have good headroom to grow,
that's right. So, so, and we believe that within the enterprise segment, they have good headroom to grow,
23:23I think so rich. You
S Speaker 523:25can describe it in further. I think they even enterprise market. They've won some large accounts recently. I think within, like even within Amazon, if you think about yesterday, we're trying to diversify out of Amazon, but they give them another order of 35,000 right? So I think some of these other other accounts, like a free delay and so forth. I think there's, I think there's room to grow. I think the bigger question is, in my mind, is how well they can penetrate the mid market.
can describe it in further. I think they even enterprise market. They've won some large accounts recently.

I think the bigger question is, in my mind, is how well they can penetrate the mid market.
S Speaker 124:01Yeah, they market. So they've done extremely well enterprise, right? They've grown to around 150 enterprise customers that do over 100k each. You can see here, you know, there's a good mix of companies that do seven figure ARR deals as well. If you look just at the, you know, the for hire fleet enterprise market, the top 100 companies in the globe all do over two 50 million in revenue. And so they're, you know, kind of big market that's, you know, top 100 top seven, you do over half a billion. So there's a big enterprise segment I agree with Quinn. When you start thinking about the mid market, the challenge is really segmentation, right? You're talking about fleets that are 50 to 100 100 to 252, 50 to 500 500 to 1000 it's really about segmentation and carving up those markets which which is more difficult, right? It kind of puts pressure on your, on your LGBT attack, basically, right? It just, it's more costly to acquire smaller customers than putting in the same effort and getting a, you know, eight and a half billion dollars free to light deal. So that's, that's the challenge, different
Yeah, they market. So they've done extremely well enterprise, right? They've grown to around 150 enterprise customers that do over 100k each.

So that's, that's the challenge, different
S Speaker 125:23did. Yeah, no, I pushed on it. I don't it's not broken out super well by segment, but right now, it's of 41% which is pretty good. But you also have to think of it, you know, in the context of the larger market, some of it is Greenfield on the head to heads where they're going up against, you know, basically Linux, they're, they're winning all the time. When you start moving into the value segments of you start running into samsara. That's where it's kind of reduced. So blanket wise, it kind of, you know, varies between 30 and 40% which is decent, but there's a lot of a lot says, you know, to be unpacked and that. So
did. Yeah, no, I pushed on it. I don't it's not broken out super well by segment, but right now, it's of 41% which is pretty good.

So blanket wise, it kind of, you know, varies between 30 and 40% which is decent, but there's a lot of a lot says, you know, to be unpacked and that. So
S Speaker 226:09their differentiation is their AI, first premium tier product, as opposed to samsar. Do we have any insight into where samsara is going, which is from their product, is Samsung are also launching an AI first? Yeah, many So,

S Speaker 526:42but the picture just high level. That's the right way to think about it. They're the premium product moving down, Sam showers, mid market, trying to move up. So they're gonna climb. So maybe that, that has something to do with maybe the valuations that and also, if you think about from these investors, will potentially look around like this, right? They're trying to figure out how many if they price this thing at 2 billion, let's say or whatever, then the return profile gets very challenging, right? They have to, this company has to go public, has a trade at 10 billion, right? So they all looking at what that ultimate x is as with as we stood to, and then figuring out, okay, back out to Okay, where we need to be today, right? Yeah, yeah,
but the picture just high level. That's the right way to think about it. They're the premium product moving down, Sam showers, mid market, trying to move up. So they're gonna climb.

S Speaker 227:36I was thinking, which is probably administrative thing, okay, so samsara is public. Motive is going to go public within the next year or so, and then, and then there's already Karu in the market that is public in the same space. Can the market? Can the public markets absorb a fourth one in the same space? But yeah,

S Speaker 331:21which I have one question. Have you situations where Netra dime customers, they also hire samsara or motive, like for the telematics solution? Is this something you have seen so far?

S Speaker 131:36Samsara? No, because they're largely a closed ecosystem. They don't play super well. They have very good integrations and a large number of integrations, but it's largely around kind of workflows and some of the you know, solutions, partners, but not so much on the hardware.

S Speaker 332:04I think just the integration with other like telematics and providers samsara was just one example. I guess you mentioned, like Geotab. I was thinking just about like the others, just trying to understand if this is like a competition, like collaboration

S Speaker 132:20opportunities or co opetition, right? So netradyne is in platform science. They're on Geo tab. They're on a handful of guys, and they're they all work similarly, yeah, so, yeah, they all kind of integrate together. I forget how many I think netradyne has, seven different categories that they cover for kind of workflow integrations with around 80 partners, so 40 active and 40 more coming on. So yes, they they're all kind of connected. Uh, Geotab and samsara have a much larger ecosystem, right? They're integrated with like 200 plus partner

S Speaker 333:07and maybe just one comment, maybe you want to add another layer of competitors, and I just want to give you the example of COVID. When COVID launched their dashcam, they didn't develop anything in house, so they bought hardware from a company called Jimmy IoT, and the software at the beginning was coming from from light metrics, the Indian company. So that was what they were doing. And I think they're like, still doing that, and you're like, selling quite well, the solution. So just like, maybe one like to to dig deeper, just to understand, like, a whole and what, what is like the approach of companies like Jimmy IoT. They're wondering, like, the cameras and then like metrics, because they're like, targeting that market as well.

S Speaker 133:59I agree. I had my list here, so, yeah, another. There's a couple of other guys, you know, big Chinese camera guy, stream Max, I think they have like, you know, 2 million plus devices in the market. These are generally targeted at the value segment of the market, right? It's their software is not the strongest, and that's why metrodyne, you know, tends to play at the premium tier and premium pricing. Yes, there is, like, if you're looking for a camera solution to put in a front facing camera in a car, you can always go to an ODM partner, like a stream Max, and put stuff together. And I think to, you know, to shower and Quinn's point earlier. I think that that's where mid market gets more convoluted. There's a lot more segmentation of that. The Enterprise these guys, they have full programs around safety and operations and how do you sell the solutions in there? And the value proposition? I think it's a lot cleaner. I think it does get a little muddier as you start getting into mid market. And that is really the challenge. The challenge and tough to candidly, really slice up meaningfully right now, it's a lot harder.

It's the best in market, and that really enables them to go through the entire video feed, build their gaming coaching workflows on more reward focusing, and also build some very complicated compound risk prediction so they can predict whether it's whether a driver is driving fast during rain, or if it is if a driver is still getting another vehicle while being distracted, that is some of the best in class features when compared to all of the other

S Speaker 138:03sure, yeah, I went, I went through a bunch of these wealth watch the last call, and then there, I think of what they call their annual summit. It was less higher on focus. They did a lot of stuff around asset tracker and beacons and some of these solutions. But okay, and for Yeah, I didn't, I didn't see the big focus on on premium. But let me take another look

S Speaker 638:45went to the marketing materials, and it seems like they're expanding their coaching features quite a lot. They're bringing up very gamified mobile app, which seems similar to what NATO tank currently has, but I'll dig deeper as well.

40:03value problem? So motive.
value problem? So motive.
value problem? So motive.
value problem? So motive.
S Speaker 240:06So remember when we looked at motive about two years ago that the growth had slowed down. So when we looked at two years ago, there they were at about 300 million Arr, and then they were going to do last like last year they were going to be doing about the plan was due 500k yeah. And then so by March this year, they were at 380 so the growth had slowed down. And then that the primary reason, then was the because a lot of their customers were SMB, and they had started churning because of high interest rates. And so they started going more mid market and up market. And this is when they took, I mean, there was a big news. They started taking FedEx. They started taking some customers away from samsara. And this is when, earlier this year, they both started suing each other on product. So samsara started seeing that. So if you Google, samsara started suing motive. And then I asked Tanuj and these guys. So Tanuj said, yeah, he talked to Sanji. That was primarily because they're starting to see motive more up market. Now, I haven't checked. I can ask my friends over there, but Carlos met one of their investment G to VP recently, and would have been back on growth. So I don't know if it's coming from up market, mid market, that I don't know, but I can find it out.
So remember when we looked at motive about two years ago that the growth had slowed down. So when we looked at two years ago, there they were at about 300 million Arr, and then they were going to do last like last year they were going to be doing about the plan was due 500k yeah. And then so by March this year, they were at 380 so the growth had slowed down.

S Speaker 541:42Yeah, that's to the extent we can get some information on, maybe how, even if they like, I don't know, ask them about how they think was their main competitor, right? They

S Speaker 541:55they're, if they're battling with Sam Sarah, which is probably good, versus if they really, really come to the enterprise market to take up next to that,

S Speaker 342:11yeah, right. Maybe just one more question, as we're talking about samsara, samsara has been expanding to site visibility, uh, beyond like the dash cams. Is this something that netradyne is also considering, like moving away from, like only the dash cams and covering like more parts of customers, facilities
yeah, right. Maybe just one more question, as we're talking about samsara, samsara has been expanding to site visibility, uh, beyond like the dash cams.

S Speaker 142:33and not in the near term? No, I think they have a couple of other segments that they, you know, want to crack. First one is, you know, kind of getting that all in one solution, then probably OEM, and then kind of, you know, moving further out into other things. But that's, I think, that's largely out of scope, that's not in there
and not in the near term? No, I think they have a couple of other segments that they, you know, want to crack.

on the roadmap right now. Okay,
S Speaker 143:00any further questions on, on, kind of the competitive piece. I know there's kind of a lot to digest, you know, it's probably the most important piece. I want to make sure we're giving it it's time.

S Speaker 543:16Yeah, I think this one, I think the strategic phase, okay, I think most important is to to get a good feel for the competitive landscape and also the growth trajectory of their business. Yep, which, which kind of ties to the competition. Also maybe, if they have plenty room left on enterprise side, maybe they're okay, but the mid market, if they're trying to go after that, that's the one that

S Speaker 546:56rich. I have to drop off. But one thing since these guys touring, they're already investor. I'm sure they have a view on this going forward. This guy, what's his name? Evan, yeah, he probably did a model on this. So let's get there. Let's ask them for their investment memo to figure out how they're thinking about this trajectory of business. I mean, they've seen the company, well, Evan may not have seen it, but never, I've seen the company for years, how they're underwriting this, what they're thinking about the exit would be, let's just see triangulate. See if we're, we're in line with these guys, or we're, we're close. We should be close. Hopefully,

Yeah, it's near or heaven. I don't know. He was on the call yesterday. You can reach out to both of them or whatever. Okay, I'll do that. Yeah, just, just ask him, like, how they're thinking about the exit from here right there. They're still putting new money into this, too. Yep.

S Speaker 248:24size and rich CAC assumptions, which is and what's our CAC assumption. And like, I think we should model CAC going higher as mid market and then their cash needs. So then, based on that, will they have to raise more capital. Or do we think at this point,

S Speaker 148:43this is it? That's right, yeah, I tried to take a stab at a part of that. I don't want to say for simplicity sake, but mid market is a big segment, right? But I kind of tuned that down so there was less of an impact. But I agree. I mean, right now, the the LTV, through some of the other slides, for mid market is like 1.8x right, versus 5.5 for enterprise. So they're getting, obviously, a lot more bang for the buck in the CAC. The CAC is similar, but the right, the LTV to CAC is a little different, so it's a lot more costly to acquire those mid market companies. You're, you're completely correct. So far, I haven't, it hasn't stressed the model in terms of capital need. We're still kind of good on that, but yes, I'm going to, I'll continue to kind of refine it and push on it, especially kind of thinking about mid market, yeah, yeah. Could be your 100%
this is it? That's right, yeah, I tried to take a stab at a part of that. I don't want to say for simplicity sake, but mid market is a big segment, right?

S Speaker 549:49right, yeah. Just ask them for their investment memorable. There was they have got it, then all kinds of stuff written in it. We can just look at it and figure it out. Yeah, if we or they have inside we don't know whatever. Preach a question on gross margin.
right, yeah. Just ask them for their investment memorable. There was they have got it, then all kinds of stuff written in it. We can just look at it and figure it out. Yeah, if we or they have inside we don't know whatever. Preach a question on gross margin.

How did they achieve that 9% jump
How did they achieve that 9% jump

S Speaker 451:34compared to last year, 51 so is that the same reason why they were able to take through from last year

S Speaker 151:41the way? Yeah. I mean, Amazon's actually right that you see Amazon kind of scaling again. They went from 48 to 84 you're getting a lot economies, yeah, so
the way? Yeah. I mean, Amazon's actually right that you see Amazon kind of scaling again. They went from 48 to 84 you're getting a lot economies, yeah, so

S Speaker 251:55that most of these, what I've seen is the blended gross margin from the previous years because of initial contracts, yeah, lower, and then the bomb is higher, but yeah, kicked in, and then the renewal, yeah, so suddenly, at one point
that most of these, what I've seen is the blended gross margin from the previous years because of initial contracts, yeah, lower, and then the bomb is higher, but yeah, kicked in, and then the renewal, yeah, so suddenly, at one point
