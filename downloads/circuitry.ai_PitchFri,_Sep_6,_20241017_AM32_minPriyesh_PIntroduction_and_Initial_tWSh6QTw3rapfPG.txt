S Speaker 11:10I am in the Bay Area. So the US investment team about we are about 10 member team. Eight of us are in the Bay Area, and we have two members in San Diego. That's the call from headquarters. Yeah, where are you based? I am actually in Tampa, Florida. Okay,

S Speaker 12:23that, yes, yes. I can give you an overview of the fund, and then we can take it from there. So Ashok, I'm priyesh, a senior associate here in the team. I joined the team rather recently. I actually joined sometime early this year, so I've been with the team for about six to eight months. My focus particularly is on AI investments, but the team overall, we look at AI, IoT, industrial applications, AR VR, automobile tech stack, and quite a few areas. So I'd say our investment mandate, in that sense, is quite broad. What we usually prefer to say is that if, if the venture has anything to do with Compute or connectivity, that works for us, that's broader Qualcomm's thesis. But as a fund, we operate rather separately from Qualcomm. At times, we do connect our startups with the Qualcomm's engineering team, either as a distributor, as a software provider, as a vendor. At times, we also facilitate some ms with the team, but our mandates are quite independent. In that sense, it's a global fund. We have offices across US, Latin America, Israel, China and India and just the US team itself. We preferred, we plan to make investments of about 130 to one 50 million a year. Our check Sizes range between two to ten million we typically are a Series A investor. At times. We have done seed opportunistically, but we prefer like series A is our sweet spot, with check sizes of two to 10 and yeah, the team, the team has been there for about 25 plus years. We have 300 active portfolio companies, so quite actively deploying capital right now.

S Speaker 112:13so then within that, we are targeting basically two personas more. One is on the sales side, where they can, from the beginning, say, based on the user specific need, recommend the right products and configuration. Some of these products have millions of configurations and all of that. So we want the AI to be able to not like a spec and a filter and such, but more based on a specific needs on what product could perform the best, what accessories are, attachments control with it. And then the second is, we are targeting the service leaders within that who are responsible for making sure the product is up and running it's delivering the usage side of it. More and more we want to go towards the usage. What is the value the head customer is getting so the manufacturer can have even service contracts, outcome based service contracts and things understood.
