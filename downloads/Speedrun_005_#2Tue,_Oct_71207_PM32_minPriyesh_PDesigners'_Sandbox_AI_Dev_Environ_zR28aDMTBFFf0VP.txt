S Speaker 21:19Thank you. I'm Rishi, the founder of margin, and we're building the world's first AI powered credit card. What if, instead of single use store cards, boring loyalty programs and endless generic rewards, there was one card network to rule them all. Margin is the first card that truly understands customer behavior in ways that were never possible before, as brands distribute the marketing card to their customers, watch as Machine Learning takes in data like transactions, spend, behavior, location and more to build deep consumer profiles. This means way better rewards for customers and large new revenue opportunities for brands. Brands can now prompt a campaign, simulate with predictive insights and push the targeted users for maximum conversion. Brands like air one can now offer the Hailey the smoothie to the girlies after parties and creatine to the gym bros when it's cutting season. And we're launching our first card with a major airlines in q1 they chose to distribute margin over all the other card providers because of our unique travel portal and network for premium partners in year one, they estimate a one $20 million of spend generating $5 million in revenue for margin, a dynamic pricing tools and hyper personalized rewards. Means that they get to offer the next generation of consumers with a truly differentiated, superior product. And we've got several more verticals lined up, like crypto cards that generate yield while you spend and personalized mortgages that reward repayments. I'm passionate about finding the opportunities others miss. I boosted my first business at 17 to put one of the first mobile sneaker bots, unlocking a whole new category for resellers. I grew the business to $1 million in ARR with a 99.6% retention rate. And my second summer, a FinTech a buy now, pay later that let customers rent anything from brands like bird and more. And throughout this journey, I have earned a lot of credit card points, and now I've set a crack team of points orders with experience across buy now, pay later and defi to build the next generation of AI powered credit products. The last generation sell for general financial products, but the future of credit is personalized, from daily spend to mortgages modules building The AI platform to power consumer credit. Thank you.

S Speaker 45:59Hey everyone. My name is Mark, and I'm the founder of so there are nearly a trillion dollars a year being spent on having humans recruit other humans. We are using AI to fundamentally reinvent how to sustain stuff, ultimately building the world's first autonomous recruiting group. We start by forward deploying into teams like ramp and using our software to automate their recruiting pipeline. We started these design partnerships just five weeks ago and already have over $400,000

S Speaker 46:32Our customers love us because instead of giving them yet another recruiting tool, we actually solve their entire recruiting problem. And the whole thing happens natively. Under the hood. This is made possible using a mix of AI agents and our custom software to handle sourcing, outreach, scheduling and hacking processes. And since we solved the entire problem, we were able to charge for outcome, meaning we make 10s of 1000s of dollars on each successful hire. And as we scale, we continue to get faster from network effects on all this data we collect smarter from our agents, continuously learning and stickier by deeply integrating with customer tools. Bernhard and I are the perfect team to finally crack this market by 19 I had already graduated Computer Science at UCLA and shipped software to millions of people at Netflix and figma. I then built one of the fastest growing LinkedIn accounts in the world, doing millions of monthly impressions, specifically in recruiting. After that, I quit my engineering job at figma to shadow a major recruiting agency and learn everything about how they operate. On the other hand, Bernhard is an incredible AI engineer from Waterloo. He's built agents at essential AI and resolve AI and co authored papers on LLM. Reasoning together, we are combining our domain expertise, AI background and distribution advantage to solve one of the most important business problems in the world. I'm Mark, founder of Truman. Thank you. Hi.

S Speaker 58:21Product every three seconds. Ai coding agent makes a catastrophic escape. Databases deleted, applications under attack. These are just the ones that make it to production sites. You've heard of them. Contrary to popular opinion, Infinite Monkeys are not going to snap out Shakespeare and they're not going to build the next half dropping, which means teams today is facing a terrible choice between the old way of quarterly OKRs, weekly business reviews, daily stand ups, all of this process is slow versus AI development, which leads to massive rework and ultimately code sloth. Brief presents a third way. Brief powers the product process of the future. We learn from your existing business systems Intuit and understand your company's context, strategy, who your users are, how you ship product. And we use all of that to wrap coding agents and a decision engine, an MCP that keeps your agents on rails and delivering the right thing for your customers and for the company.

S Speaker 610:36all, hi everyone. My name is Drew. I'm the founder and CEO of maniac. We are unwrapping the GBT rather category leaders from Harvard, Salesforce own the model later, but beating GP five on your tasks is R requires choosing a model, a fine tuning algorithm, a context retrieval or prompt optimization tool, and running evaluations only to find that the performance is worse than GPT five. So you repeat this process for new ideas, for optimization, for new evals and bugs that come up over time, and for every single agent in your workload, this is simply infeasible at scale, and even category leaders are struggling to keep up. That's why we built climate an automated, distributed performance layer to optimize your models with your evals, using your team's expertise. Here's how it works. First, we evaluate live calls to the AI layer. Then we fine tune the cost, quality frontier for your AI agents, and finally, we orchestrate calls to Pareto optimized models that you now fully own. This infrastructure is inevitable, and we are the team to build it. I studied physics and mathematics at Stanford, published research in theoretical physics at Caltech, and previously co founded a Bain Capital that startup notebook labs. Roshan brings deep systems expertise from Apple CoreOS. Tom previously led products at two startups and researched HCI and agentic AI at Stanford. And Tobias is a DEF CON black badge recipient. We all just graduated from Stanford in June and in less than two weeks in soft launching. Engineers and CTOs from these companies have either been added to our waitlist or are already in the pipeline before it can take over 50 hours a month to optimize five agents for an AI app. But with maniac, it's less than an hour per month with a 15 minute integration, resulting in state of the art performance for your specific tasks over the horizons, our vision is to build burrito optimal AI at scale for enterprise intelligence that you can fully know. Thank you. Hi.

S Speaker 1015:20Hello, everyone. I'm Irish, co founder and CTO of axon, and we are building the Deep Mind for finance. I have over a decade of experience in pi, not just the labs. I've done the research, published paper, secured patents, built and shipped products that millions use worldwide. And my co founder, Nick, he's a third time founder with two successful eight figure and since to young and Twitter, also notably an angel investor in Deep Mind. He specializes in the visual perception model of the brain, something called active inference. And with just the two of us, we have done two big breakthroughs. Firstly, using active inference, we have built a real time Prediction Engine for financial markets. It has been optimized to run its CPUs and for high frequency traders. Secondly, we have invented an end to end testing the lowest latency infrastructure in the world for sending signals across audience. It's about seven milliseconds quicker than state of the art. And currently patent. With these breakthroughs, we have deployed our models to market, doing $1.5 million in traded one last month alone, we are generating 3k in revenue every day. This is 38 from where we started two months ago, and currently we are looking at $1 million of annualized revenue. But for us, this is just a start, similar to how DeepMind chose games to prove that their tech works, we have chosen high frequency trading, but the possibilities are limitless for our real time Prediction Engine, whether it comes to wearable devices, autonomous vehicles or robotics, we are axons, and we would love to speak to you more about it. Thank you. Hi.

S Speaker 1117:29My name is Marlon Park, and I'm so excited to introduce you to data AI powered social purpose. This is how legacy numbers in a trillion dollar social category represent our relationships today, and this is a snapshot of our on beta users say notes about friends to unlock notes about themselves. We're bridging the best of consumer social, the magic virality and genuine intrigue of seeing what people say about you, into the world of AI, where these notes become insanely useful. We're building the largest textual data mode about our relationships to part of the most highly annotated social graph of all time, because for the first time ever, llms are smart enough to reason over millions of unstructured, human, messy notes at scale, understanding relationships like never before. On Vega, users don't post for themselves like traditional social media. Instead, our models analyze your notes to generate AI powered social organs. These are hyper curated groups of people who will fundamentally change your life, surfaced with perfect context like what your mutual say about them and AI generated compatibility scores. Vega is the first AI native social network where personal and professional worlds intentionally collide for the first time ever, llms are smart enough to stitch together content from both sides of our lives, because who we hire, date and invest in are all driven by the same core principles. Want to find the next ex open AI or x Jane Street founder, while they're already on makeup, Ben and I met a decade ago at puna hueva school.

Everyone. My name is Kevin. I'm the founder and CEO of asthma, we make AI companions who can look in the eye. Six months ago, we launched a mobile app. Other Half today, we had 2.5 million annual run rate growing 70% month over month, and we're profitable. The secret is simple. Our competitors are crowding themselves in a sea of lifeless text bots. But humans are wired for text. Humans are wired for presence. We've used the game engine with our own multimodal machine learning models to create an engine to make AI come to life, and honestly, the results are shocking. Irish free users spend 80 minutes a day on our app. That's 30% higher than Tiktok average. Paid users spend two and a half hours a day.
