S Speaker 20:14and I, you know, worked at big tech previously, I was at Instagram for about six years, working on various social features, like video specifically. And I was at Google Photos, working on AI reputation features for your photos. And I also worked on Spotify ads. So pretty familiar with the ad space as well, very consumer centric and social centric.

S Speaker 32:09that. Yeah, that's, I mean, clearly we've spent more time recently in a space and, I mean, in space of generative media, plus now that overlap advertising and marketing. And I think one of the trends that we've clearly seen is that the adoption for this is has been really big. Yeah, so, and then, essentially it's because the barrier to create something good, yeah, has significantly been lowered so that it's, it's less about the market moving in this direction, in my opinion, it's more about just increasing the size of the market. Significant, yeah, so

S Speaker 33:01significant uptick in many of these companies that are serving these markets are growing really fast, yeah, so, like, for you guys specifically, and then would love to actually, it seems, Priyesh, you've talked to them about creating, Yep, yeah, we would want To get your thoughts around, in general, that space of where creative plays, where icon plays, and where creative fi plays, and Hey, Jen, all these cool is also growing really, really fast. And I guess familiar with all these companies, okay, yeah, and some of them overlap in ADS. Some of them are just content generation, yep, in general, like, would love to get your views and because one of the concerns that we in general, like Haffer with, like, the because of barrier to entry is low, you're going to have a lot of these tools, is, can you continue to differentiate over time? Yeah, and as foundation model gets stronger and stronger, please, they take more of the technology mode, if you will, and then the layers above it get slimmer and slimmer. So hence, the barrier to entry is lower.

S Speaker 14:21Yeah. I mean, I think that's like, pretty much the take on it, right? Is that? What we're seeing is that, because it's so easy to just, like, create something, there's actually not that much loyalty amongst marketers with these types of tools. They're just going to try whatever it is and whatever produces the best performing content. That's like, what they're going to continue using until the next guy goes ahead and shows like, I can create even better content. So, like, the other thing is that a lot of these platforms are doing kind of, like, similar ish things. If you look at it on the surface right, like, there's a lot of dependency on swipe files. There's a lot of dependency on, like, getting brand inputs from the marketer. There's a lot of dependency on, like, the website, blah, blah, blah, and then like these platforms will generate like variations of what they see is, like, high performing content out there, and that just leads to this, like, saturation issue on social media, which a lot of marketers are very nervous about, actually. And the other thing that we've heard too, is that marketers are playing creative roulette essentially, essentially, is like, how they like to call it like, they're just like, press, press, press. And then eventually maybe they'll see something, yeah, that is like, oh, that's like, kind of an interesting idea, right? But that takes a lot of time from them. Like, I was just at a talk with like, silver side. I don't know if you guys are familiar with them, but they were like, showing, like, this is the promised process, right? You just, like, put in a prompt the AI, like, does its thing and then generates this, like, like, beautiful, creative or something. And then they were like, but actually the process is, like, through, like, yeah, exactly. And he was like, this, this can take us like, weeks to do this. And so that part is, like, really, really frustrating for people like marketers, will just end up using these ad tools as just like, inspo, inspo files, just like, show me what it is other competitors are doing. Maybe it'll generate some ideas, and then I'm going to go ahead and just like, put together the ad myself.
Yeah. I mean, I think that's like, pretty much the take on it, right? Is that?

S Speaker 36:36Yeah. So, so you're saying that real adoption, I mean, there's a lot of experimentation going on, but the the if these tools are providing real value, is TBD because, because the friction of being able to one shot the video that you want is too high because you can't one shot today or two shot today, and and then maybe, you know, a lot of times you're just retrying,
Yeah. So, so you're saying that real adoption, I mean, there's a lot of experimentation going on, but the the if these tools are providing real value, is TBD because, because the friction of being able to one shot the video that you want is too high because you can't one shot today or two shot today, and and then maybe, you know, a lot of times you're just retrying,

S Speaker 27:12yeah, well, that's the case today, right? But I think this technology is also moving so quickly, like you were just one year, two years ago, mid journey came out, and you can't even meditate any text, you will have the hardest time putting text on the market images. And today, that's not a problem at all. So I think it's just a matter of time, because before the image of videos become indistinguishable from like, actual photographs or videos. So I think that's why this market is hot. It might not be. It might be kind of like buy marketing, keep pressing the bullish today, but I think that's going to change quickly. But you are right. I think you also touched on, okay, what are the differentiating points between the platforms? I think here's where the context comes in. If you know more about this consumer, if you know more about the social trends. That's what's gonna set the platforms apart. It's not the foundation models, because everyone's gonna use the same foundation models, yeah,
yeah, well, that's the case today, right? But I think this technology is also moving so quickly, like you were just one year, two years ago, mid journey came out, and you can't even meditate any text, you will have the hardest time putting text on the market images.

It's not the foundation models, because everyone's gonna use the same foundation models, yeah,
S Speaker 18:11I guess, like, the other thing that I would add to that is, you know, brands are very concerned about brand reputation, like, if you have somebody like Coca Cola, right? They're not going to just post randomly generated stuff like on their platform. They're going to reach out to like an agency or like somebody who has a lot of reputation in this space, so that they can demonstrate that they are incorporating AI, but they're doing it in a way that is thoughtful with their like brand. And so this concern around AI noise really ties into what how people like maintain their brand reputation and safety while also scaling their output too. That's like a Yeah, that's what they're trying to figure
I guess, like, the other thing that I would add to that is, you know, brands are very concerned about brand reputation, like, if you have somebody like Coca Cola, right? They're not going to just post randomly generated stuff like on their platform.

That's like a Yeah, that's what they're trying to figure
S Speaker 38:58I guess agency, you see, there's two ways this can be played out, guesses, because as the models get better and better, like Joe was pointing out, which is that progress over the last six months, like before vo three came out. Like, oh my god, this place needs something. The predictability of your prompt, doing something, yeah, I played with everything else that was out there, and I was just doing that. And then when vo three came out, it felt like a step change rather than change. So it felt like a step change, yeah, it sounds to me like now you're going to continue to see some of these
I guess agency, you see, there's two ways this can be played out, guesses, because as the models get better and better, like Joe was pointing out, which is that progress over the last six months, like before vo three came out.

9:45step change changes. So from
step change changes. So from
step change changes. So from
step change changes. So from
S Speaker 39:47six months ago to now, you're already significantly better than maybe in a year or two years from now, you're, yeah, really better, yeah. I think the question is, then you, I mean, I think there'll be aI native AI agency, yeah? Like, Ricola wants to go to an agency then one point, but it's not different. Like, you can't tell the difference between a real person, oh, yeah, generated video, yeah. Then at that point it doesn't really matter. Like, yeah, so my guess is, like, the legacy agencies might be slower to adopt as a there is a chance that you can become an AI native agency yourself.
six months ago to now, you're already significantly better than maybe in a year or two years from now, you're, yeah, really better, yeah. I think the question is, then you, I mean, I think there'll be aI native AI agency, yeah? Like, Ricola wants to go to an agency then one point, but it's not different.

Like, yeah, so my guess is, like, the legacy agencies might be slower to adopt as a there is a chance that you can become an AI native agency yourself.
six months ago to now, you're already significantly better than maybe in a year or two years from now, you're, yeah, really better, yeah. I think the question is, then you, I mean, I think there'll be aI native AI agency, yeah? Like, Ricola wants to go to an agency then one point, but it's not different. Like, you can't tell the difference between a real person, oh, yeah, generated video, yeah. Then at that point it doesn't really matter. Like, yeah, so my guess is, like, the legacy agencies might be slower to adopt as a there is a chance that you can become an AI native agency yourself.
S Speaker 110:33Yeah, I It's really interesting. Like, you know, the advertising agency space is kind of going through a identity crisis. I would say, you know, they have, they have the connections they have like this, like human taste making ability, right? People talk about that a lot in, like, marketing and advertising. It's like, who is kind of, like, has their pulse on the culture and is able to transform that into a moment for the brand. So I see a couple of things with agencies, right? Traditional agencies, if they want to stay ahead, they are trying to figure out what their AI strategy is. They are trying to figure out, how can I scale my output but still deliver that kind of like human expertise to their clients. Some agencies are creating, like a, like a sub agency that's like, just AI, like, they've rebranded themselves exact, like, just like silver side. Silver Side is actually part of, like a larger, much older, like advertising agency. So silver side actually worked with Coca Cola, like silver side, because of that, like parent agency, they're able to get deals with, like Levi's, for example. Like Levi's wanted to do a campaign where, oh no, sorry, Levi's previously did a AI generated campaign trying to show, like, diverse bodies or something, and it was terrible, like people huge backlash over it. And then they approached silver side to figure out how to do, how to use AI in a way where they could still kind of embody this, but in a more responsible way. So, yeah, I
Yeah, I It's really interesting. Like, you know, the advertising agency space is kind of going through a identity crisis.

S Speaker 112:35yeah, yeah. So that strategy that I've seen a bunch of agencies take, but one thing that I was going to say to your earlier point, and I think Priyesh, like you had this in the document that you sent over, I would just say, like, there's, there's a difference between like, I wouldn't confuse like the video models versus like The ad type of tools. And the reason is because video models, like, Sure, it's great that they can, just like, they're going to be able to generate crazy videos. You know what I mean, like, the quality is going to go up and up. But the step change shouldn't matter, because what actually matters in marketing and advertising is the idea is, like, how does this actually hit with that person. And you cannot do that unless you like, have the audience like persona like you truly understand what they care about, the culture, the language. That's not something that like happened you like, you still have to prompt like the video to be able to generate what it is. And we see like marketers becoming a director, essentially, like they have a vision in their mind, and then they're, like, shaping the video model to generate this vision. Yeah, there's, like, a lot more there.
yeah, yeah. So that strategy that I've seen a bunch of agencies take, but one thing that I was going to say to your earlier point, and I think Priyesh, like you had this in the document that you sent over, I would just say, like, there's, there's a difference between like, I wouldn't confuse like the video models versus like The ad type of tools.

S Speaker 313:51So then, essentially, the feedback is important to be able because as a marketer today, you probably do AB tests, right? Like you do AB tests. Of, okay, did this work, and did this not work, and all that, right, like, and then even that can be automated when you're doing large ads, I guess, with generative ads can be done, and then the ads can all be auto generated based on the closed feedback loop, right? And then, yeah,
So then, essentially, the feedback is important to be able because as a marketer today, you probably do AB tests, right? Like you do AB tests.

And then, yeah,
14:28and that would be,
S Speaker 314:32that would be cool, because then, like, most of it is automated,
that would be cool, because then, like, most of it is automated,
that would be cool, because then, like, most of it is automated,
that would be cool, because then, like, most of it is automated,
S Speaker 114:35yeah, yeah. I think the feedback loop matters a lot. But one thing that I will say, I think, like, as a engineer, like as a tech like, product person, like, this makes a lot of sense, right? This is like, I used to be on the growth team at Twitch, and so we would always just, like, run experiments, and then whatever variation works, like, you know, ship it. But one thing that I will say is these, AG, tools need to be able to generate high enough quality as a baseline, because it's hard to communicate to marketers that on top of the fees that you're paying for like publishing these ads and the fees that you're paying to the ad tool platforms, you also have to pay Additional in order to have enough stuff out there to, like, teach it to actually then make a good ad. Like, that's not a good starting point when you're communicating the value to a marketer, and they just want to be able to see, like, on my first hit, that I'm going to get an ad that's, like, highly performant. So yeah, I do think the feedback loop is really, really important, but that baseline needs to be there, too interesting.
yeah, yeah. I think the feedback loop matters a lot. But one thing that I will say, I think, like, as a engineer, like as a tech like, product person, like, this makes a lot of sense, right?

15:48What? So, what are you guys building?
What? So, what are you guys building?
What? So, what are you guys building?
What? So, what are you guys building?
S Speaker 115:52So we're building like the context. So we're doing like, we're basically tracking conversations and culture that's happening online. And we listen to like what is interesting, we index the information, we search and analyze it, and then we return it as structured context for the AI when it's doing that ad generation. So like, one example we love to use is save for like headphones, right? You're going to have different personas. You're going to have the person who works at home, the commuter, somebody who is running and like an audio file, right? They care about many, many different things. And then you want to be able to use the language that speaks to each persona. So, like an audio file, like, I can't even, I can't even list it, like, it's like sound scenery or something last time I took a look at it, but that would never come up for a runner like runners don't really care that much about the audio quality. They care about safety, and so we do all of that research so that AI can, just like, take that into account when it's crafting, like the creatives, okay?
So we're building like the context. So we're doing like, we're basically tracking conversations and culture that's happening online.

And then so you would sell this to like agencies or
And then so you would sell this to like agencies or
And then so you would sell this to like agencies or
S Speaker 117:02so we're actually targeting like ad generation platforms, but we think brands and agencies who have in house AI workflows could also use us as well.
so we're actually targeting like ad generation platforms, but we think brands and agencies who have in house AI workflows could also use us as well.
so we're actually targeting like ad generation platforms, but we think brands and agencies who have in house AI workflows could also use us as well.
so we're actually targeting like ad generation platforms, but we think brands and agencies who have in house AI workflows could also use us as well.
17:13Yeah, let's take
S Speaker 217:15that example a little bit further, like for example, if you're Bose, whether you are advertising directly with us, or through a platform, we can then generate the different ads depending on the purpose of our campaign, right targeting runners versus the audio fronts, and that's what's going to make the difference.
that example a little bit further, like for example, if you're Bose, whether you are advertising directly with us, or through a platform, we can then generate the different ads depending on the purpose of our campaign, right targeting runners versus the audio fronts, and that's what's going to make the difference.

S Speaker 117:53yeah, because we, like, inject it. It's like context engineering for the AI. So, like, we're doing so much like data engineering and like analysis, and we just feed what is important to the AI, so then it generates the like, okay, like, what
yeah, because we, like, inject it. It's like context engineering for the AI. So, like, we're doing so much like data engineering and like analysis, and we just feed what is important to the AI, so then it generates the like, okay, like, what
yeah, because we, like, inject it. It's like context engineering for the AI. So, like, we're doing so much like data engineering and like analysis, and we just feed what is important to the AI, so then it generates the like, okay, like, what
yeah, because we, like, inject it. It's like context engineering for the AI. So, like, we're doing so much like data engineering and like analysis, and we just feed what is important to the AI, so then it generates the like, okay, like, what
18:09is important to AI. Oh, okay.
is important to AI. Oh, okay.
is important to AI. Oh, okay.
is important to AI. Oh, okay.
S Speaker 319:40So your goal is also to generate at the key value proposition or differentiation is that it's much better context, yeah, than the other platforms. Yeah, as the

So your goal is also to generate at the key value proposition or differentiation is that it's much better context, yeah, than the other platforms. Yeah, as the
S Speaker 219:53platform play, as you pointed out, there's many of these platforms, and they all need to deal with the individual advertisers, but we are approaching it from a platform point of view. So then we can reach all the advertisers through individual platforms, but all of them will get better context, thus better performing apps, too.
platform play, as you pointed out, there's many of these platforms, and they all need to deal with the individual advertisers, but we are approaching it from a platform point of view.

S Speaker 120:12I think like we're going after infraplay, because actually it's not just advertising that we're interested in, we're actually interested in, like, entertainment and media, because I think that, like, video models, all of this stuff, is going to get so good that you're going to be able to log on to Netflix and it's going to give you a show that is, like, tailored for you, and that's how we're going to consume media. And, like, basically right now with social media platforms, you know, the algorithm is tailored to feed you content that you are interested in. That's just gonna get to a whole other level. And that's what we're interested in powering is people are gonna want really hyper relevant, like personalized content for them. And we think that there's a opportunity there. But right now, people are very interested in doing this for ads, so that's where we're starting off with. But the big play is entertainment and

S Speaker 321:06media. I mean entertainment and media, I think in general, you still need, especially if it's like longer form content, but if it's like a few seconds, then it's fine. You can still get Hang on. We've all started seeing content show up in our Instagram feeds that is generated today,

S Speaker 321:36and then, I guess, let's say, in a few years from now, or maybe even a few months from now, get models that can generate long form Yeah,
and then, I guess, let's say, in a few years from now, or maybe even a few months from now, get models that can generate long form Yeah,
and then, I guess, let's say, in a few years from now, or maybe even a few months from now, get models that can generate long form Yeah,
and then, I guess, let's say, in a few years from now, or maybe even a few months from now, get models that can generate long form Yeah,
S Speaker 221:49I believe that video duration will take after the same agent curve, either just a couple of months ago, you might get an agent to run for five seconds, or just now it's like going to multiple websites, and now it's then doing your entire days of work, multiple weeks of work. So I think the same trend will check out difficult video generation.
I believe that video duration will take after the same agent curve, either just a couple of months ago, you might get an agent to run for five seconds, or just now it's like going to multiple websites, and now it's then doing your entire days of work, multiple weeks of work.

S Speaker 322:11Yeah. I mean the infrastructure layer also has to get built up for that. The big difference in video you can't single shot a 15 minute video,
Yeah. I mean the infrastructure layer also has to get built up for that. The big difference in video you can't single shot a 15 minute video,
Yeah. I mean the infrastructure layer also has to get built up for that. The big difference in video you can't single shot a 15 minute video,
Yeah. I mean the infrastructure layer also has to get built up for that. The big difference in video you can't single shot a 15 minute video,
22:27because then, in case of media,
because then, in case of media,
because then, in case of media,
because then, in case of media,
S Speaker 322:30it's all about storytelling, yeah, and it's all about, like, detailed storytelling, and it's all about control,

S Speaker 122:47and, yeah, because it's, I think you can't just think about like films and movies in the traditional sense, right? I mean, not everybody likes to talk about gaming, but gaming is a huge predecessor for like interactive media as well. Like, I think there's an opportunity that you go to like interactive media spaces. I mean, like, I'm seeing some agencies also go after like interactive advertisements, essentially where, like, you can go into a physical space and like, experience the brand, right? That is like, so human, and you're immersed within it. And so I think immersive interactive
and, yeah, because it's, I think you can't just think about like films and movies in the traditional sense, right?

S Speaker 123:50know, that's so true. Like, I think a lot of like, I've watched Bandersnatch. I don't know if you're referring to Bandersnatch. Oh, Bandersnatch is, like, it was interactive fiction, kind of, I guess it was like a movie that Netflix put out with Black Mirror, where, like you and you can affect the storyline of the movie. I mean, I thought it was so cool. The storyline was confusing, but, but I thought it was really, really cool. Um,
know, that's so true. Like, I think a lot of like, I've watched Bandersnatch. I don't know if you're referring to Bandersnatch.

S Speaker 324:16yes, yes. I think that's where it was it like one of the episodes of black radar, or was it a movie?
yes, yes. I think that's where it was it like one of the episodes of black radar, or was it a movie?
yes, yes. I think that's where it was it like one of the episodes of black radar, or was it a movie?
yes, yes. I think that's where it was it like one of the episodes of black radar, or was it a movie?
S Speaker 124:22It was actually a movie. It was like a there was mixed responses to it. I don't know if it came out like too early or not, but people were like, I'm not quite sure what this movie just told me.
It was actually a movie. It was like a there was mixed responses to it. I don't know if it came out like too early or not, but people were like, I'm not quite sure what this movie just told me.

one or two movies I think I watched this, yeah, so I think I watched one of the movies like that, yeah. Now I want to know what if I had chosen? Oh, yeah, yeah. A lot of times I don't want to go back and yeah, redo it.

S Speaker 325:33to crack it so far, right? Yeah, we wanted to do it. Called it, name the company, meta, because of that, yeah. And then now he's doing something else altogether. Yeah, that's true.
to crack it so far, right? Yeah, we wanted to do it. Called it, name the company, meta, because of that, yeah. And then now he's doing something else altogether. Yeah, that's true.

S Speaker 125:48Oh, but actually, that reminds me so, like, one thing that I noticed in the one pager that you guys sent over and in terms of how the AI like,
Oh, but actually, that reminds me so, like, one thing that I noticed in the one pager that you guys sent over and in terms of how the AI like,
Oh, but actually, that reminds me so, like, one thing that I noticed in the one pager that you guys sent over and in terms of how the AI like,
Oh, but actually, that reminds me so, like, one thing that I noticed in the one pager that you guys sent over and in terms of how the AI like,
S Speaker 425:57what was it I just sent some short notes and a few questions on around things around that we are. talking. to.
what was it I just sent some short notes and a few questions on around things around that we are. talking. to.
what was it I just sent some short notes and a few questions on around things around that we are. talking. to.
what was it I just sent some short notes and a few questions on around things around that we are. talking. to.
S Speaker 126:04But one of the things is that I think it's looking at a lot of like other startup, like aI ad tech, but we haven't talked that much about the competition throughout platforms. So like Tiktok is investing in doing AI ad generation. Meta is doing it like Google is doing it. They're really poised to do this. They have the distribution, they have the platforms. They are working on AI models. Like, it's one thing that cannot be overlooked. And so that's the thing is, like these ad startups, they really need to compete, not on scale. They need to compete on the quality of the generation.
But one of the things is that I think it's looking at a lot of like other startup, like aI ad tech, but we haven't talked that much about the competition throughout platforms.

26:40That's a good point,
S Speaker 326:43which is there's a real threat from from these tiktoks of the world and Instagrams of the world to actually come up with their own totally for ads. Yeah. Have they ever, like, since you guys have that background, have they ever done it in the past? Forget like providing better tools for just generating ads?
which is there's a real threat from from these tiktoks of the world and Instagrams of the world to actually come up with their own totally for ads. Yeah.

S Speaker 127:12Well, Tiktok is doing it like it's out. Tiktok is already doing it, yeah, Tiktok is already doing it.
Well, Tiktok is doing it like it's out. Tiktok is already doing it, yeah, Tiktok is already doing it.
Well, Tiktok is doing it like it's out. Tiktok is already doing it, yeah, Tiktok is already doing it.
Well, Tiktok is doing it like it's out. Tiktok is already doing it, yeah, Tiktok is already doing it.
S Speaker 227:20And Tiktok has one of the best video editing Yes, period, not exactly. So,
And Tiktok has one of the best video editing Yes, period, not exactly. So,
And Tiktok has one of the best video editing Yes, period, not exactly. So,
And Tiktok has one of the best video editing Yes, period, not exactly. So,
S Speaker 127:28yeah, it's a natural progression. I mean, it's, it's not hard like IG is, IG is doing. I feel like I saw that they were doing, like, AI copy, right? The natural way that these platforms do it is, like, do generated copy and then move into like, multi modal stuff. So I think 100% they're going to go into it because they want to be able to equip the brands and the companies like and SMBs that are on their platform to create they want to reduce that friction to launch a pan paid campaign. So they're very incentivized to do this
yeah, it's a natural progression. I mean, it's, it's not hard like IG is, IG is doing. I feel like I saw that they were doing, like, AI copy, right?

S Speaker 128:13ads tools? Oh, we want to, we want to sell to them, right? Like Tiktok, we would want to sell them the context that we have across different platforms, across different like sources, like there's going to be like discord chats, like Slack conversations that are happening. There's like dark social stuff, but there's also like Spotify, like comments. That's why we want to do the infra play, because all of these people are so focused on their own platforms that they forget that that visitor a on Tiktok is also an IG user. They're also a LinkedIn user. If you can combine all of that context into one thing that they can put into their generation, that's a huge win for them.
ads tools? Oh, we want to, we want to sell to them, right?

28:52So isn't that also
S Speaker 328:54like for all these generative media platforms? That's also they're playing because, you know, the user wants to post the same content like or a version of the same content on Instagram and Tiktok and YouTube shorts. So then, still, they won't end up using Tiktok tools or Instagram tools individually.
like for all these generative media platforms? That's also they're playing because, you know, the user wants to post the same content like or a version of the same content on Instagram and Tiktok and YouTube shorts.

29:24Sorry you're saying like the brands,
Sorry you're saying like the brands,
Sorry you're saying like the brands,
Sorry you're saying like the brands,
S Speaker 329:27like all these other like, for example, createy or createify, or all these other companies, they have a real risk of
like all these other like, for example, createy or createify, or all these other companies, they have a real risk of
like all these other like, for example, createy or createify, or all these other companies, they have a real risk of

29:42Instagrams generative there?
Instagrams generative there?
Instagrams generative there?
Instagrams generative there?
S Speaker 129:43Yeah, so there, there is a risk. But I guess what I'm saying is that there is, like, this needle that they can thread, if they're able to produce content that is cross platform, but still platform native and for that audience, then like, they can win, because the marketer is going to use whatever can produce the best content for them, and so like Tiktok, obviously, is going to try to create like the best Tiktok type like content. But that's not necessarily the best for like LinkedIn. It's not the best for like Brock, you know what I mean. So, um, like,
Yeah, so there, there is a risk. But I guess what I'm saying is that there is, like, this needle that they can thread, if they're able to produce content that is cross platform, but still platform native and for that audience, then like, they can win, because the marketer is going to use whatever can produce the best content for them, and so like Tiktok, obviously, is going to try to create like the best Tiktok type like content.

But that's not necessarily the best for like LinkedIn. It's not the best for like Brock, you know what I mean. So, um, like,
S Speaker 230:18I think that's also a huge advantage for startups, right? Because the foundation models are easy to use, very cheap to use for everybody. So it's actually, you know, if a company like meta, they are very incentivized to use their own internal models, whereas, like startups, don't have that restriction at all. And actually that might give them a huge leg up, because that Bureau obviously doesn't exist
I think that's also a huge advantage for startups, right? Because the foundation models are easy to use, very cheap to use for everybody. So it's actually, you know, if a company like meta, they are very incentivized to use their own internal models, whereas, like startups, don't have that restriction at all.

S Speaker 330:43for them. Yeah, that's a good point. Yeah. And
for them. Yeah, that's a good point. Yeah. And
for them. Yeah, that's a good point. Yeah. And
for them. Yeah, that's a good point. Yeah. And
S Speaker 330:47so but, but you also want to do, you can serve context, but you still want to do, end to end, generating media on your platform as well, right?
so but, but you also want to do, you can serve context, but you still want to do, end to end, generating media on your platform as well, right?
so but, but you also want to do, you can serve context, but you still want to do, end to end, generating media on your platform as well, right?
so but, but you also want to do, you can serve context, but you still want to do, end to end, generating media on your platform as well, right?
S Speaker 131:02Oh, no. So we are purely looking at the context. I mean, like, you know, a lot of people have actually asked us this. They're like, if you have such good context, why don't you do, like, the end to end stuff. Like, one of the things, I mean, like, we're not closed off to it, okay, so, like, if that's going to be the path to win, like, we'll take it for sure. One of the things that we noticed, though, is that with end to end platforms, they're usually spread really thin, right? You have to focus on, like the inspo this, like the input that you're putting into the platform, and then also the generation. So I just feel like, like, from our perspective, we'd rather like own a specific area that is like, we can just own it and offer premium context for people like, you know, you have your forester Gartner like, they have been, like, working with these companies so extensively, and it's because they give these big brands some insight, like, into industry specific stuff. And we want to, like, do that, but like at scale, we want to be able to tell you this person is this persona. Talk to them like this. Like, show them stuff that's like this. Like, make them feel like when they see the ad, they're not like, this is an advertising experience. They're like, Oh my gosh, I've been looking for this type of product. Like, where has this been? You know what I mean? So, yeah, see
Oh, no. So we are purely looking at the context. I mean, like, you know, a lot of people have actually asked us this. They're like, if you have such good context, why don't you do, like, the end to end stuff.

You know what I mean? So, yeah, see
S Speaker 332:18the only thing that I see, see, you've got, I agree with you. When you focus, you can get like, really like, if you get really good at it, then nobody else can compete with you in
the only thing that I see, see, you've got, I agree with you. When you focus, you can get like, really like, if you get really good at it, then nobody else can compete with you in

32:32that the how do you close
that the how do you close
that the how do you close
that the how do you close
S Speaker 332:33the loop right? Like, because there's variables that you're introducing with this one. Once you've got the context, then you leave it to the user of this context to input in whatever tools they're using to generate
the loop right? Like, because there's variables that you're introducing with this one. Once you've got the context, then you leave it to the user of this context to input in whatever tools they're using to generate

32:47Yeah, video. There's that
Yeah, video. There's that
Yeah, video. There's that
Yeah, video. There's that
S Speaker 332:50variability. Like today, the same context will produce a different video on a different platform, and, like, they can vary. So,
variability. Like today, the same context will produce a different video on a different platform, and, like, they can vary. So,
variability. Like today, the same context will produce a different video on a different platform, and, like, they can vary. So,
variability. Like today, the same context will produce a different video on a different platform, and, like, they can vary. So,
S Speaker 132:57yeah, oh, that's like, yeah, that's such a good question.
yeah, oh, that's like, yeah, that's such a good question.
yeah, oh, that's like, yeah, that's such a good question.
yeah, oh, that's like, yeah, that's such a good question.
S Speaker 333:00So, so then you're leaving it's like, Oh, your
So, so then you're leaving it's like, Oh, your
So, so then you're leaving it's like, Oh, your
So, so then you're leaving it's like, Oh, your
33:07context wasn't good.
S Speaker 333:10The model not that good. Or what the tool that you were using not good. So, and at the same time, then you need to still close the loop, because closing the loop would actually be how the ads performed. That tool is left to another tool. Yeah, so that's my I mean, that's how I like, I think in a lot of these cases, even open ended, yeah, then it's like customers are trying to figure out, okay, where do I point the finger to?
The model not that good. Or what the tool that you were using not good. So, and at the same time, then you need to still close the loop, because closing the loop would actually be how the ads performed. That tool is left to another tool.

S Speaker 334:21happen is in the early days, my guess is you'll have to show the users, and most I've seen across industries, you have to show the data, Yeah, versus relying on them to show the data. So and then you might like, if you don't want to develop these tools, which I agree. I mean, essentially, at one point, there will be many tools and but you might have to have at least a recipe, or two, three recipes that these are the ones that you highly recommend.
happen is in the early days, my guess is you'll have to show the users, and most I've seen across industries, you have to show the data, Yeah, versus relying on them to show the data.

35:03You've tested them. Yeah,
You've tested them. Yeah,
You've tested them. Yeah,
You've tested them. Yeah,
S Speaker 135:07that's such a good read. Because, like, that's one of the things that developers want to see, right? They want to see the trace. They want to see that the LLM is actually working, or, like, is this bullshit, basically. So we need to, like, show our sources. We need to show like, how this is actually happening before we establish the credibility for them to, like, continue using us. The other thing that, like, we're kind of interested in, too, is like, like, do we specialize in a specific industry? Like, do we get so good in like fashion or something, or like makeup or something, and own those verticals, and then expand horizontally, and we can say, like we have the best context for X industry. And then, once we establish credibility there, then we move horizontal. No, I think
that's such a good read. Because, like, that's one of the things that developers want to see, right? They want to see the trace.

35:55so. What do you like
S Speaker 335:57you just started the company? Are you looking to raise, like, a seed round? Now,
you just started the company? Are you looking to raise, like, a seed round? Now,
you just started the company? Are you looking to raise, like, a seed round? Now,
you just started the company? Are you looking to raise, like, a seed round? Now,
S Speaker 136:05I think we do want to eventually raise, but right now we're super focused on just like, making sure that this is actually valuable to people. Like, we want to see how it fits into the ecosystem. We want to make sure that our messaging is correct. So that's what we're really focused on right now. But like, yeah, we are definitely interested in fundraising. Like, down the line, like, you need money to do this. I mean, our AWS bills are cranking your jobs. Oh,
I think we do want to eventually raise, but right now we're super focused on just like, making sure that this is actually valuable to people. Like, we want to see how it fits into the ecosystem.

around this time last year. Oh,
around this time last year. Oh,
36:38so it's been a year in,
so it's been a year in,
so it's been a year in,
so it's been a year in,
S Speaker 236:41not on this venture. We try to a couple of different things. And started this about two

not on this venture. We try to a couple of different things. And started this about two
36:47months ago, okay, and then
months ago, okay, and then
months ago, okay, and then
months ago, okay, and then
S Speaker 136:49you I left, like, couple years ago. Actually, I've been, like, exploring different like startup ideas and like, just learning how to be a good founder, essentially, but I feel like now, like, I'm able to put together, like, all of those lessons, and this is a space that, like, we're super excited about. I think that there's good, like, really strong, long term potential. I think between Joe and I, with our backgrounds, like and my just like experience as, like, a designer, like, it lends itself really, really well to this. We have such a good, like, creative, technical, like, background, so yeah, like, we're super excited about this

S Speaker 337:29space, definitely very exciting. And I think the timing is now. So
space, definitely very exciting. And I think the timing is now. So
space, definitely very exciting. And I think the timing is now. So
space, definitely very exciting. And I think the timing is now. So
37:34yeah, thanks for
37:45I mean, yeah, creative, we're looking at it right now. So
I mean, yeah, creative, we're looking at it right now. So
I mean, yeah, creative, we're looking at it right now. So
I mean, yeah, creative, we're looking at it right now. So
S Speaker 337:49definitely, I mean, the traction is really good so far. Yeah. And what we like is this, they've got, they've thought through how to close the loop.
definitely, I mean, the traction is really good so far. Yeah. And what we like is this, they've got, they've thought through how to close the loop.
definitely, I mean, the traction is really good so far. Yeah. And what we like is this, they've got, they've thought through how to close the loop.
