So we have been connected for a while, since the time I was an x ai, he's been pretty busy these days, because he just had a baby as well. He was traveling around the world, yeah, like trying to get into something, into open AI so they can, they have a start of wing. So we have been talking to them as well, open

S Speaker 19:29so apply intuition is kind of like, so this is one of the comments from one of the founders who have we had an LOI with. So they used applied intuition before, and only worse than Isaacson. So they said that if those models are kind of like the windows 90, what we are bringing is like Windows 11, right? So that's the greatest advantage that we are bringing in compared to the previous, existing model. So apply intuition. They kind of like take the autonomous cars, they apply block filters, kind of like taking assets from their pre built simulations and place it in front of the cars to, kind of like, simulate traffic, simulate pedestrian crossing and all that, right? Yeah, kind of like very old school, and the data that you get out of it is very kind of limited, but with a generative AI element into it, the each scenario can be played probably 1000 times in order to get probably 100,000 data points. And rating that you get out of it for the robots is like, way there. So that's the added advantage. We are bringing in even liquid two ventures, or Joe and Dana, they all invest in applied tuition as well. And this kind of like, sort of advantage as well, okay, not competing with them. Rather, they could kind of like, take this model from us and implement it in their solution. So,

S Speaker 410:44but you will, would you so your end product is a model, or the end product would be like a simulation tool for for that use case that you described earlier, with the city, it
but you will, would you so your end product is a model, or the end product would be like a simulation tool for for that use case that you described earlier, with the city, it
but you will, would you so your end product is a model, or the end product would be like a simulation tool for for that use case that you described earlier, with the city, it
but you will, would you so your end product is a model, or the end product would be like a simulation tool for for that use case that you described earlier, with the city, it
S Speaker 110:57will be a simulation model. So we are building the model for that. So right now, what we have is a model which is like, fine tuned on 10 million hours of video data, and in in the for the next five to six months, we will be fine tuning it and deploying it into a couple of series as CSV companies like foundation robotics, figure AI, we are in toxic all that, right? And after the after that, we will be entering phase two. Phase two is where we will probably, like, train our own models with probably 100 millions of hours a week, and we're working on that right now itself. Yeah. So why? The reason that I bring this slide is that the before starting cosmic brain, I had an open source project with Harvard MIT where we kind of like made diffusion models and, you know, nerve based models, where we took two images and converted that into some relations, mostly for education and history content. And it went from zero to 300,000 users in less than a year. One of the clients include Larry Page, and like a lot of the people out there started using it, it's still going. It's still going as a great kind of like, nonprofit or open source project out there, and it's one of the best models out there, used by Harvard, Yale Duke MIT for the libraries and museums. So, yeah, just to prove the point, like, oh, like, we are not getting into this just now, but there has been a precursor for what I'm doing right now, and for the technology. We are basing our technology on a couple of recent research papers that came up. So there are three things that makes us different, right? One is the diffusion models, the warp models itself. The second is the physics engine that's connected to it, right? And third is the data set. We have a very high quality data set, industry level quality data. So when it comes to like some other companies who are in the field right now, right most of them use generalized media data set, usually YouTube data or like generalized videos of like robots performing different tasks and the output quality of the model is lacking way behind. And for training robots, you need high quality data that sensor input and output has to be very precise, and that's where, kind of, like a very precise industry of quality data set comes into play. How are you collecting the data? Yeah, so right now, the model is trained on 10 million hours of data. The second thing is that we, my CTO and CO are two founding engineers at Google, so they kind of built YouTube, Google ads and couple of other lot of different internal startups within Google, right? And they have connections to all the major industries there is. So we are kind of like making strategic partnerships with companies like GM, a couple of IPC companies. So IPCs are integrated. I will come to like industrial PC manufacturers who have connections like who supply chips to each and every robotic layers, so we can leverage a lot of data sets from them. Yeah, and the way that this works is that we don't have that today, right? No, we're working on it. So today we have the 10 million our grain more maybe working on acquiring more
will be a simulation model. So we are building the model for that. So right now, what we have is a model which is like, fine tuned on 10 million hours of video data, and in in the for the next five to six months, we will be fine tuning it and deploying it into a couple of series as CSV companies like foundation robotics, figure AI, we are in toxic all that, right?

It's still going as a great kind of like, nonprofit or open source project out there, and it's one of the best models out there, used by Harvard, Yale Duke MIT for the libraries and museums. So, yeah, just to prove the point, like, oh, like, we are not getting into this just now, but there has been a precursor for what I'm doing right now, and for the technology. We are basing our technology on a couple of recent research papers that came up. So there are three things that makes us different, right? One is the diffusion models, the warp models itself. The second is the physics engine that's connected to it, right? And third is the data set. We have a very high quality data set, industry level quality data. So when it comes to like some other companies who are in the field right now, right most of them use generalized media data set, usually YouTube data or like generalized videos of like robots performing different tasks and the output quality of the model is lacking way behind. And for training robots, you need high quality data that sensor input and output has to be very precise, and that's where, kind of, like a very precise industry of quality data set comes into play. How are you collecting the data? Yeah, so right now, the model is trained on 10 million hours of data. The second thing is that we, my CTO and CO are two founding engineers at Google, so they kind of built YouTube, Google ads and couple of other lot of different internal startups within Google, right? And they have connections to all the major industries there is. So we are kind of like making strategic partnerships with companies like GM, a couple of IPC companies. So IPCs are integrated. I will come to like industrial PC manufacturers who have connections like who supply chips to each and every robotic layers, so we can leverage a lot of data sets from them. Yeah, and the way that this works is that we don't have that today, right? No, we're working on it. So today we have the 10 million our grain more maybe working on acquiring more
will be a simulation model. So we are building the model for that. So right now, what we have is a model which is like, fine tuned on 10 million hours of video data, and in in the for the next five to six months, we will be fine tuning it and deploying it into a couple of series as CSV companies like foundation robotics, figure AI, we are in toxic all that, right? And after the after that, we will be entering phase two. Phase two is where we will probably, like, train our own models with probably 100 millions of hours a week, and we're working on that right now itself. Yeah. So why? The reason that I bring this slide is that the before starting cosmic brain, I had an open source project with Harvard MIT where we kind of like made diffusion models and, you know, nerve based models, where we took two images and converted that into some relations, mostly for education and history content. And it went from zero to 300,000 users in less than a year. One of the clients include Larry Page, and like a lot of the people out there started using it, it's still going.

Yeah, and the way that this works is that we don't have that today, right? No, we're working on it. So today we have the 10 million our grain more maybe working on acquiring more
S Speaker 414:04data sets, and then that 10 million hours is from YouTube videos
data sets, and then that 10 million hours is from YouTube videos
data sets, and then that 10 million hours is from YouTube videos
data sets, and then that 10 million hours is from YouTube videos
S Speaker 114:09that we cannot displace. That's a Yeah. We got like, yeah. We got a couple from couple of projects that we running. Okay, got it Yes, yeah. So the way this will work is that we take the digital twin, we create a digital twin of the robot that the company is making. For example, if it's figure AI, figure AI has their own proprietary design esthetic model of the robot. We create a digital twin, and we input that into the simulation that we are building, right and using Gen AI tools, just from text, they will assimilate probably 100,000 different scenarios. So from tasks like taking a you know, glass or wine bottle, putting it on the table, or opening the microwave oven and putting an item into it and heating the food up, right so all those things, tasks can be repeatedly simulated over 1000 times till the sensory output is good enough for the robots to kind of like perfect the task. That's the way we approach again. So if you look at the competition, so right now, most of the startups use three different ways to train their robots. So I had a chance to work with Optimus as well in Tesla. So the way the robots are trained right now is that humans wear VR headsets and kind of like build the data sets from scratch, right? They put different tasks repeatedly till they get every angle covered, every pressure points covered, every sensor output is corrected, right? That takes a long period of time. The second way it's done is that we tell you operate the robots, whether it be industrial robots or robotic arms or human robots. Humans actually tell you operate till the sensor output data is kind of like accurate enough to kind of like train itself. The third way is to kind of like run the sensor, like, make the robot do different tasks, so that the sensors have repeated outputs, probably, like, 100 different data sets. And they like, you know, go through it, clean the data, and, you know, take the best quality data and put that, put it back into the robot to create, right? All these three methods take a lot of time, lot of human labor, like, lot intensity, hours of working with the robots, and it's like very time consuming and cost a lot, right? One of the other solution, alternative solutions, that people have come up with, right, is using Omniverse. And I success. So I 6m and Omniverse is like one of the two simulation models that most of these companies use as of today. When it comes to those two models, there are two other constraints. So simulations definitely have improved based on the traditional ways of training the robots. It greatly improves the process. But on the other hand, it requires a lot of technical expertise, right? You need someone who is a very good designer for Unreal or unity. You need someone to pull in their assets from Omniverse USD database, or even for ISIS community, you need to simulate different experience. Yeah, you need to create the entire warehouses or entire houses for the digital twin to kind of like, interact with. And that takes a lot of expertise, a lot of time one second, right? And what we are bringing into the table is that you don't need to be a very big, you know, engineering, skilled Lyd designer to kind of like, make the simulation happen. Rather, it can be done with text. So you just type it in, the type it in different scenarios, on how or where the robot have to interact with, what the process looks like, what the skills that the robot have to acquire over this period of time, and the robot will play itself in that given scenario and trade. So that's added advantage, and AI is bringing into the table the team. So I used to work at Xai before, so I just quit my job last Friday. I worked at xa for almost a year when Elon started the company number 2023, I started pulling in most of the engineers from rest of his companies, and I got a privilege to work with them, trained the Colossus, the 100,000 GPU clusters, built rock and did a various number of projects there.
that we cannot displace. That's a Yeah. We got like, yeah. We got a couple from couple of projects that we running. Okay, got it Yes, yeah.

S Speaker 119:42lot of hackathons together, worked on a couple of projects, became friends, and they were like, oh, like, So Ed and Chiu. They were like, Google is so boring right now. They're not as competitive. They are more the corporate structure. So they would just want to quit their job into and get into a startup that's actually a moonshot idea, or bringing, you know, building something very unique. So that's the reason they quit their job and joined with me and Brent, yeah, he was like, still researcher. He's still, you know, not like working anywhere else and now, but yes, so yeah, AGS houses, the places where partnerships bloom as

of today, that's good, yes.
S Speaker 120:21So for the go to market, we are actually kind of like getting Lois from robotics manufacturers, IPCs, and also, like big industries as well. So our plan is to kind of like deploy the first model in CSA, CSV companies, couple of humanoid startups in the next five to six months, right? And probably in a year's time, we'll, we'll be partnering up with a large scale industry like GM or a couple of other European companies we are talking to us now. And the Lois that we have got interest as of now is worth $20 million annually. So we will be expanding that greatly as well as we expand the company.

S Speaker 421:01And so, when did you start the company at home,
And so, when did you start the company at home,
And so, when did you start the company at home,
And so, when did you start the company at home,
S Speaker 121:06in like, started working on this project. Or, yeah, like, when
in like, started working on this project. Or, yeah, like, when
in like, started working on this project. Or, yeah, like, when

S Speaker 121:18Yeah, the Company Incorporation and the team and everything came together probably again, two, three months back. Okay, but I have been working on this for our years. So yeah, that's why I said the precursor of this project was with Howard and MIT. So yeah, there's like, it did not start yesterday or last week. So, yes, yeah. So this is this slide also explains what I've been talking about, the growth for the next two years so on. Because of the Lois we have initially we thought of it, the launch phase can be like five to $6 million because each of the startups that brought Lois with us very willing to pay probably 2.5 to $3 million for annual subscription models. So it depends, it also depends greatly on the GP usage, the data sets that they require, the number of robots they need to create, and the complexity of the skill set, right? So it's a very customizable, customized enterprise level subscription model that we are kind of targeting different clients as of today. And a client like GM can bring in probably $20 million in just one go as a substitute model for it per year.
Yeah, the Company Incorporation and the team and everything came together probably again, two, three months back. Okay, but I have been working on this for our years.

S Speaker 122:38yeah, they're not using applied tuition as of now. But yeah, maybe, like, there's a bunch of these, exactly. So yeah, they will be, like, pivoting from that, so for the first time. So one of the so when I tell you about IPCs, you'll get a clear idea, right? So IPCs are the chip integrators for all robots there is. So there's couple of, like, five to six companies, they are supplying chips for all manufacturing robots, robotic arms and even human robots. And for the first time in 50 years, they're including GPUs into their PCs, which means that they are seeing a potential for AI and Gen AI elements that can be included on the forefront, right? So pondering of these people is like an inverter tunnel, inverter funnel, right? So if you partner with these four or five companies, they will be supplying to all these great manufacturers, including GM, including, like all the other auto manufacturers in Europe, the human robot is companies, right? So a software that's integrated in the PCs come pre built before it's implemented into their factory. What are these IPCs? There are a couple of So, Rockwell, ACCION, there are a couple of other companies as well. So we are trying to talk, talk to them, with a couple of integrators. We haven't got to that level yet.

S Speaker 124:01We are hiring 10 more people. So since we got the funding as well, right now, we are hiring a team of 10 people. So we are talking to a couple of people from Google, DeepMind, from Stanford, AI Lab, couple of researchers, and also a couple of people from Nvidia as well. We are given, like, a three week trial period to work with us and see how they work, perform and, you know, build a model with us and make them permanent. Okay, also looking for office space. So we are trying to purchase, not purchase kind of like, so most of the startups that we got Lois from, they're willing to give us their robots, the physical robots.

26:4040 to 50. That's it,
S Speaker 126:41yeah, for as of time the small models, yes, but as we get more data sets, so that's what we're working on. So just a partnership with GM will give us probably 100 millions hours of data. So that will require us way more than 50 GPUs, yeah? So yeah, we're doing it step by step. So phase one is like a 40 to 50 GPUs, and phase two is like, we will expand the GPU clusters.

S Speaker 129:59it's a so eventually. So our goal is to, even though we are going specific as of now, eventually we'll have enough data sets to create a generalist marketplace, right? So we will have this dashboard like a marketplace, where companies can buy skill sets, different brains of the robots from us, and install it in the hardware. So let's say, for a skill to mop the floor for a human robot, they can just purchase the skills and then install it, right? If they need a skill set to handle, you know, bartend or that we are also talking to Chef robotics, which is like cooking on for, like robotics company, right? So they can just purchase, you know, the cooking data sets, the skill set, or the mind for the robot. So we are in eventually, we'll have a generalist or like a marketplace where with 1000s of different skill set, where people can just buy it up, right? That's cool. And also that will also lead us to an operating system, right? So eventually we are also planning for an operating system for the hardware robotics to work on, so people build just the hardware robots, whether it be industrial robots, whether it be human robots or whether it be autonomous cars. So when they input the OS, the hardware will start working. So that's kind of the end goal for this.

S Speaker 431:13What about like some of these robotics companies themselves, they're also going vertical now, which is, like figure said that there's there. You know, they're not. They're moving away from the partnership with open AI. 1x has built their own models as well the name so it seems they announced that as well. Yeah, what's your take on that?

S Speaker 131:46Yeah, so we actually talk the company that you're talking right now. We talked to them, right? The one thing that open, so even though open AI X AI will eventually get into robotics. Open AI as of now, they became open about it, they are getting into robotics, right? But they do not have they haven't built such a simulation model internally. What they have is like text to video, text images, even like llms, right? It's similar to x ai. We both grok three, which is the best model out there, defeating open AI and deep sea, right? That's the last project that I did with it. But in order to build something that simulation, you need entire GPU clusters just dedicated on this purpose, right? And they don't. They don't have the luxury to do this as of today, probably in the next two to three years, they will, they will have it right? So I don't think there is a, you know, a quality, or, like, you know, benefits for partnership for a figure, or like, 1x to partner with opening as of today. But that can come in shortly. But they're

S Speaker 132:45yeah? Building it themselves, yeah? One of the Yeah, that's the thing. So when they try to build themselves, they are using, as I said, Omniverse and is, accept, right? In order to build something internally like this, they will probably need to dedicate their entire team to building something like this, because it's as complicated. So create, building a robot is a complex on itself. So I had greatly dealt with Optimus asshole, right? The optimist team is fully engaged in training the robots creating the human data sets. The training itself includes lot of manpower, a lot of time consume, right? So even Optimus in Tesla, which is the most advanced, they will not have time to build something like this, yeah, but they will allow someone else to do it for them.

So even Optimus in Tesla, which is the most advanced, they will not have time to build something like this, yeah, but they will allow someone else to do it for them.
S Speaker 433:31You well, optimists, you think will also be a

33:41before, yes, why?
S Speaker 133:46That's the way Tesla operates. So I did speak to them about this, but even Elon, I've spoke about this idea with Elon. Elon believes greatly in simulations, but the for approaching optimists, it's like they the way they're doing it. They're very stagnant on that approach, on that they're like, Oh, this is set. This is the way to go. This is only way to go, right? So they believe strongly they're doing it with tele operations and collecting data. Yeah, tele operations collecting media data is through VR and all that. So that's the agenda they have, and they're strictly following it. So they, yeah, the conversation that I had like, oh, please implement that in a series ACB company first. Then, you know, come, come to us kind of thing
That's the way Tesla operates. So I did speak to them about this, but even Elon, I've spoke about this idea with Elon.

S Speaker 435:16And so that's no, this is very interesting. So what I wanted to like we have across all of these three businesses that you're going after. We have a pretty I mean, robotics. We have lots of chips that go into robotics today, but these are not human right, robots today. So So where Qualcomm typically shines is performance per watt
And so that's no, this is very interesting. So what I wanted to like we have across all of these three businesses that you're going after. We have a pretty I mean, robotics.

37:48that's good, though.
S Speaker 138:19So I have a lot to speak about that. So the reason why wall labs will not succeed as of this year or the next year is because they're going after a generalist am mode, and the research is not good enough to perform text to game engines of text to like unlimited like video engines as of today, right? And their training data sets is scrambled all over the place. They take like data from like all over the place which is not, which is not the way to go, and they use nerf models on top of that. So for my precursor muse, we use nerf, right? So nerf has its own limits. Nerf is like a different model, like, like diffusion. So it has its own limits. Its best use case is definitely like, media, interactive, educational tools, or like, probably history content or something like that, right? But to build something like this, you definitely need way more than that. That's where, you know, denoising comes into play. Diffusion models come to play. Like spatial AI, we need to apply g slat like, there's a lot of different kind of, like, technical notes into it, which makes the model what it is as of today, right? And it has to be very niche, right? It has to be very unique, so that the entire media data sets is just for one purpose. So that's why a generalist agent will definitely come out from what we are building in the next two to three years. But as of today, there's no research or any study that can say how this is possible as an app, like journalism is possible. So that's why I'm really skeptical about what world Labs is building, and even Odyssey and all that is
