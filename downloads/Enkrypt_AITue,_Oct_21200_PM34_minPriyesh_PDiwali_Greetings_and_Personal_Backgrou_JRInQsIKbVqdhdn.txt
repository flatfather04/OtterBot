S Speaker 21:49Bangalore, Agra, Delhi, okay, but
Bangalore, Agra, Delhi, okay, but
Bangalore, Agra, Delhi, okay, but
Bangalore, Agra, Delhi, okay, but
1:56yeah, and you go there often.
yeah, and you go there often.
yeah, and you go there often.
yeah, and you go there often.
S Speaker 12:02Yeah. Awesome, yeah. Well, good, good. I don't know if you haven't caught up with Priyesh, one of my colleagues. He's also working with me on this thesis, right? And and I wanted to maybe this call, I'll let Priyesh introduce himself to saila on this call, I wanted to maybe understand, I know you're actually fundraising, right? And a few things about, like, you know why your architecture will succeed. And we talked about inline identification, and you know, for not just your internal AI applications, but any application, per se, if you can unpack that architecture piece and how you have built a flexible mode against multiple other companies that existed, and you know, probably there's so many, right? And I've been talking to a few others too. So company transparency, I've talked to Lanai, right? I've talked to the lucky hours of the world, the lessons of the world, right? And, and they have an API based, or a browser based, play right, not necessarily a proxy based, all right? So something that, if you can unpack on this call, which is very interesting, and the second part is in terms of traction, how will you play out by 2026 right? So because that's effectively what we'll be underwriting, we probably need to raise within 18 months or 24 months, right? So yeah, so those are two key questions top of mind for me as and thanks for sharing the materials we've gone through. It was pretty, pretty elaborate. So thanks, pretty comprehensive. So thanks for sharing that. Priyesh, do you want to quickly introduce yourself and then dig into
Yeah. Awesome, yeah. Well, good, good. I don't know if you haven't caught up with Priyesh, one of my colleagues. He's also working with me on this thesis, right?

S Speaker 33:43it? Yes, I'll just keep my intro quick. Sahil, pleasure meeting you. I'm Priyesh. I'm a Senior Associate here in the team. Been with the team for about a year and a half, closing to my second year. Now. I've been in venture for about three years, and spent my early days in India, did my undergrad from there, worked with a lot of early stage startups.

Cool, cool, yeah. So happy to
Cool, cool, yeah. So happy to
Cool, cool, yeah. So happy to
S Speaker 24:12I'll take your second question first. So we are we want to end the year close to $2 million next year, the target is to get to between seven to $10 million and ideally, like it again, ideally reach all my series B matrix within 2026, itself. So I really might be next year later, next year, given like, again, it's all about winning the market. It's not about like, yeah, right. So that's the mindset for the company right now, right? How can we accelerate like, whatever is needed to accelerate whatever, whether that's capital, whether that's team, whether anything else, partnerships, all of that.

5:02And even if you don't
And even if you don't
And even if you don't
And even if you don't
S Speaker 25:06before Series B, like without Series B, the goal right now, with this funding, is seven to 10 next year at 2025 in 2027 so that's that's how we're looking at it, based on the current pipeline and the pipeline that is coming in right now, or the interest in regard, right? So that's on the traction side, happy to
before Series B, like without Series B, the goal right now, with this funding, is seven to 10 next year at 2025 in 2027 so that's that's how we're looking at it, based on the current pipeline and the pipeline that is coming in right now, or the interest in regard, right?

So that's on the traction side, happy to
S Speaker 15:28and then, and on the traction side, if you can dissect that a little bit, yeah, is it largely, and we talked about some examples of enterprises, right? So are you effectively targeting the top 1000, top 2000 or going mid market as well, like channel versus direct. Can you give me some color into two to seven bottle drive?
and then, and on the traction side, if you can dissect that a little bit, yeah, is it largely, and we talked about some examples of enterprises, right? So are you effectively targeting the top 1000, top 2000 or going mid market as well, like channel versus direct. Can you give me some color into two to seven bottle drive?

So are you effectively targeting the top 1000, top 2000 or going mid market as well, like channel versus direct. Can you give me some color into two to seven bottle drive?
S Speaker 25:47Yeah, so my current Python will drive me to six right now. Okay, that's good with all the conversions from first conversation to like getting all the probabilities. That's where it will drive me to, and that's the new new expansions, new use cases, or new pipeline. It's right again. But given the stochasticity around around everything, that's where I'm saying seven to 10 next year, ideally, yeah, but not that. If I get more tech, more than can I say, No, no, I don't want it. So that's the plan. What we've done up until now is target like the hardest customers. Yeah, right, and I think that's what we are seeing. So large enterprises very demanding, but also very rewarding from a product perspective, of product robustness perspective, if you will, right? So what we want to do is that's already happening right now. I don't know if you had a chance to dissect that in the tech or in other materials is now we are building like now we have partners coming to us, whether those are resellers or mmsps or MSPs, who are bringing us the mid market or SMB market, where they can serve those, where the team can focus on Again, the other set of hardware customers, but the product is like, becomes turnkey for them, where they go and plug and play and it works, right? So that's, that's the mindset. By next year, I want my pipeline to be coming at least 30 to 35% coming through my partner.
Yeah, so my current Python will drive me to six right now. Okay, that's good with all the conversions from first conversation to like getting all the probabilities. That's where it will drive me to, and that's the new new expansions, new use cases, or new pipeline. It's right again.

S Speaker 17:41Yeah, makes sense. And, and I remember Deloitte was one of the largest customers, right that you probably have, yeah, I also noticed that Amazon also shows up right as one of the largest color on to what size of like, how do you price the deployments and how do you size it today? Is it for employee per se phase? Is it project based?
Yeah, makes sense. And, and I remember Deloitte was one of the largest customers, right that you probably have, yeah, I also noticed that Amazon also shows up right as one of the largest color on to what size of like, how do you price the deployments and how do you size it today? Is it for employee per se phase? Is it project based?

Is it for employee per se phase? Is it project based?
S Speaker 28:07Yeah, no, it's consumption based. So it's not for employee base because you're selling to builders. Yeah, it's like, the same way that you're consuming open, AI, right, right, right. You're consuming India.
Yeah, no, it's consumption based. So it's not for employee base because you're selling to builders. Yeah, it's like, the same way that you're consuming open, AI, right, right, right. You're consuming India.
Yeah, no, it's consumption based. So it's not for employee base because you're selling to builders. Yeah, it's like, the same way that you're consuming open, AI, right, right, right. You're consuming India.
Yeah, no, it's consumption based. So it's not for employee base because you're selling to builders. Yeah, it's like, the same way that you're consuming open, AI, right, right, right. You're consuming India.
8:21I think I remember, I remember that.
I think I remember, I remember that.
I think I remember, I remember that.
I think I remember, I remember that.
S Speaker 18:24Yeah, so you're selling to builders within these large enterprises who are building their own AI application. Am I correct? Yes, okay, perfect, perfect. So very clear on this. Finish Any questions on the traction before we jump into the architecture.
Yeah, so you're selling to builders within these large enterprises who are building their own AI application. Am I correct? Yes, okay, perfect, perfect. So very clear on this. Finish Any questions on the traction before we jump into the architecture.
Yeah, so you're selling to builders within these large enterprises who are building their own AI application. Am I correct? Yes, okay, perfect, perfect. So very clear on this. Finish Any questions on the traction before we jump into the architecture.

8:41Not, not really Deepak, no,
Not, not really Deepak, no,
Not, not really Deepak, no,
Not, not really Deepak, no,
S Speaker 29:32let me, let me tell you, I mean is, and the recent acquisitions is, it's sort of educates the market. I agree, it sort of also educates our Express customers that they need something like this, yeah, when they compare my product, when they see that I have an operand, yeah, then I'm not convincing them to buy the product. I'm convincing them to buy the best
let me, let me tell you, I mean is, and the recent acquisitions is, it's sort of educates the market.

9:59product. Best Product, yes, yes.
product. Best Product, yes, yes.
product. Best Product, yes, yes.
product. Best Product, yes, yes.
S Speaker 110:03Inside, I know you can leverage it. So that piece, right? So convincing the enterprise for the best product. So I'm coming from that point of view. Can we unpack why? Yeah, so the best product. Let's spend time
Inside, I know you can leverage it. So that piece, right? So convincing the enterprise for the best product. So I'm coming from that point of view. Can we unpack why? Yeah, so the best product. Let's spend time
Inside, I know you can leverage it. So that piece, right? So convincing the enterprise for the best product. So I'm coming from that point of view. Can we unpack why? Yeah, so the best product. Let's spend time

10:32So there are a couple of things happening here,
So there are a couple of things happening here,
So there are a couple of things happening here,
So there are a couple of things happening here,
S Speaker 210:39can show I can go deeper into this as well, but, yeah, what's what's happening here is what strike, or anyone else would came to do, is the red teaming. But what's the offer in the market as Okay, I'll tell you, if your agent, like is compliant with nisdayi, RMF or or obas top 10 and things like that, yeah? Which, honestly, if you go to Bangalore, blacks like, that's, that's the minimum I want. That's a table stake. If you don't even have that, then don't even talk to me. Yeah. The way to differentiate that is, again, as people like we want, what are risks for me, not for the mom and pop shop down the road, right? And that's where the policy engine comes in. So what policy is showing me is my customer. So HR block, for example, is uploading IRS regulations. Vanguard is uploading FINRA or SEC regulations, or vcbs is uploading HIPAA and the internal AI guidelines, yeah, and then Red Teaming is
can show I can go deeper into this as well, but, yeah, what's what's happening here is what strike, or anyone else would came to do, is the red teaming. But what's the offer in the market as Okay, I'll tell you, if your agent, like is compliant with nisdayi, RMF or or obas top 10 and things like that, yeah?

Vanguard is uploading FINRA or SEC regulations, or vcbs is uploading HIPAA and the internal AI guidelines, yeah, and then Red Teaming is
can show I can go deeper into this as well, but, yeah, what's what's happening here is what strike, or anyone else would came to do, is the red teaming. But what's the offer in the market as Okay, I'll tell you, if your agent, like is compliant with nisdayi, RMF or or obas top 10 and things like that, yeah? Which, honestly, if you go to Bangalore, blacks like, that's, that's the minimum I want. That's a table stake. If you don't even have that, then don't even talk to me. Yeah.

S Speaker 211:58test cases and generating scenarios, generating systems at in real time based on the policy, so for internal blog, based on a random policy that they can upload the system will the agent will understand the context And then attack my customers, agent with that context. So for internal block testing whether I can manipulate their agent to violate IRS regulations, versus for Vanguard violating FINRA, or, as he said, SEC regulations, or two very different things that none of the competitors can do, and you should go like, if you want, you can go out and verify this, but that's a core piece of different season that, given like, every customer tells me that like, when you get to that session, if there is a like, if you get to a place where you talk to customers, they'll tell you the same thing, like the risk is contextualized to them, not to

So you probably then tailor it to make it more specific, add context to it, and run test cases against those policies to figure out how vulnerable or how strong the system is.

S Speaker 213:36Yes, yes. Okay, yes, that's the whole there's the whole aspect of the product where the right handing agent is figuring out, and the other thing is completely, there's no services. Aspect is getting them onboarded, getting, like, the IP address is whitelisted because, like, it's the infrastructure part or the access part, that's where the engagement is not on the product, right, once,

S Speaker 114:09again, huge trends completely. And this is only if I'm building an agent for Qualcomm, let's say customers or HR support agent, right? What I'll do is I'll take the policies, I'll upload it in encrypt right. Encrypt agent will then query mine agent that I'm building right, and do the red teaming testing on that right. So that's that's one. Can we talk about the guardrails side effects? Yeah.
again, huge trends completely. And this is only if I'm building an agent for Qualcomm, let's say customers or HR support agent, right?

S Speaker 214:37So guard rails is very similar, where policies feed into guardrails as well. Yeah, it's literally like, putting your like, whatever you're thinking, yeah, if you can put pen to paper, yeah, that becomes your guardrail, yes.
So guard rails is very similar, where policies feed into guardrails as well. Yeah, it's literally like, putting your like, whatever you're thinking, yeah, if you can put pen to paper, yeah, that becomes your guardrail, yes.

S Speaker 214:59I can have my system prevent against the same risks that you're worried about on the garden at runtime side? And again, that's a strength. And the other strength, obviously, is the multi modalities, like the other thing that we discussed that last time as well, where, obviously enterprises text is minuscule, honestly ministry compared to voice, and then that's where like,
I can have my system prevent against the same risks that you're worried about on the garden at runtime side? And again, that's a strength.

S Speaker 215:53Yeah, so that's where they use our API integration. Okay, they're using it. So there are a few system integrators and CPA firms who are integrating our API into their security platforms, or we partner with the likes of sky high or net scope and other so they're OEM. They are doing OEM integration understood.
Yeah, so that's where they use our API integration. Okay, they're using it.

S Speaker 116:20So, because what I was trying to think there are two ways to attack an enterprise, right? One is give them a single layer for all AI that they're using, which will be embedded third party internal Right? Or give more secure protection on internally developed AI, which is, I will, I'll make sure it's not long ago, makes your policies at first, and God is at first, which is what you're doing at the core, right? You're not focused on as much on the horizontal piece today, because red teaming itself is a different beast of a problem itself, right?

S Speaker 216:56Yeah, yeah, exactly. So, I mean, the way from this is possible to think about this is, I think I mentioned this so half of the Fortune 500 from 2000 do not exist today. Why? Because they weren't able to take advantage of the Internet back then, and that's the case happening right now with every enterprise, including that or BCBS anyone, right? They're going through the same journey where there are a lot of startups and upstarts in the space who can disrupt them because they're leveraging AI, so they need to be five steps, or at least like doing something like they have pressure on figuring out, like, from the CEO from the board, what can I do for my whole business, my customers? Right? It's not about consuming AI for my type of productivity and all of that
Yeah, yeah, exactly. So, I mean, the way from this is possible to think about this is, I think I mentioned this so half of the Fortune 500 from 2000 do not exist today. Why?

S Speaker 117:43like that. Sorry, yeah, I get it. I get it. And so you run into model armor, Google's model armor.
like that. Sorry, yeah, I get it. I get it. And so you run into model armor, Google's model armor.
like that. Sorry, yeah, I get it. I get it. And so you run into model armor, Google's model armor.
like that. Sorry, yeah, I get it. I get it. And so you run into model armor, Google's model armor.
S Speaker 217:50We have run into Google's model armor, and the customer said, like, our guard is for a lot better than model armor.

S Speaker 117:57Yeah, I've heard model I'm not come up in multiple conversations, but it's, it's not been as strong a product on the market, right? So who do you run into then, style? Because the striker does claim regime, I'll tell you. Virtual claims. Recommend virtual. Yeah, right?
Yeah, I've heard model I'm not come up in multiple conversations, but it's, it's not been as strong a product on the market, right? So who do you run into then, style? Because the striker does claim regime, I'll tell you. Virtual claims. Recommend virtual. Yeah, right?

18:19yeah. And luckera. I
S Speaker 218:21mean, like era, I mean, like, does not do red teaming. Like they have the Gat Out thing, which is more outsourced. But yeah, so we used to come across protect initially as well, like, up until six months ago, acquisition, yeah, yeah.
mean, like era, I mean, like, does not do red teaming. Like they have the Gat Out thing, which is more outsourced. But yeah, so we used to come across protect initially as well, like, up until six months ago, acquisition, yeah, yeah.

S Speaker 218:48No, okay, I know sanity, but we haven't come across that they're to us their focus. I mean, their Red Teaming is like, they have an amazing team from very poor security background. But that's that, like, it's a security background, so it's not business logic that you're like, right, that you're looking at CVS in AI systems, not like when AI goes rope and puts your business at risk. And the other aspect is, at least from what I understand from the team and from other people, is their focus is again on like employee protection, or employee usage protection of AI, rather than people building with AI. They may be, it's all it's all adjacent.
No, okay, I know sanity, but we haven't come across that they're to us their focus. I mean, their Red Teaming is like, they have an amazing team from very poor security background.

S Speaker 119:35I see that they started claiming so they pivoted completely to agent security. Everything is so they do agent rescue. It's all like the space is also moving pretty quickly. Yeah. So one question I have time for you is, do you do network protocols today? Because I know the protocol that cursor uses is different from, you know, let's say, You know what an agent would use, like an MCP protocol, right? So do you work at the protocol level, or do you work at an API level only today?
I see that they started claiming so they pivoted completely to agent security. Everything is so they do agent rescue. It's all like the space is also moving pretty quickly. Yeah. So one question I have time for you is, do you do network protocols today? Because I know the protocol that cursor uses is different from, you know, let's say, You know what an agent would use, like an MCP protocol, right?

So do you work at the protocol level, or do you work at an API level only today?
S Speaker 220:11Yeah, we work at the agent level, not, not at the protocol level. So we have MCP security that our customers are using today. Yeah, but, but again. So one of the things that we need to understand is Agent security is very different from,
Yeah, we work at the agent level, not, not at the protocol level. So we have MCP security that our customers are using today. Yeah, but, but again. So one of the things that we need to understand is Agent security is very different from,
Yeah, we work at the agent level, not, not at the protocol level. So we have MCP security that our customers are using today. Yeah, but, but again. So one of the things that we need to understand is Agent security is very different from,

S Speaker 120:27yeah, network security. I of course,
yeah, network security. I of course,
yeah, network security. I of course,
yeah, network security. I of course,
S Speaker 220:31yeah, right. So it's all within the agent that's happening, rather than something that's going in and out from two distinct entities, which is where Paulo would come in.
yeah, right. So it's all within the agent that's happening, rather than something that's going in and out from two distinct entities, which is where Paulo would come in.
yeah, right. So it's all within the agent that's happening, rather than something that's going in and out from two distinct entities, which is where Paulo would come in.

S Speaker 120:42I, both components, right? I mean, it won't be like an agent, right, if you give it tools, but not that it has to tap into the network to actually exercise. But I completely get it right within an agent. Can I exist in a silo where it doesn't, doesn't have network traffic? But I'm saying autonomous agents in three years or two years, will look very different from what we have today.

solve for that. Oh, yeah, okay,
solve for that. Oh, yeah, okay,
S Speaker 221:16it's they don't understand the context of what's happening in the network, right? Yes, this is the same way that that our systems are becoming more intelligent. Network Security needs to evolve to be intelligent enough, right? Right now it's all ones and zeros. It's not a sparse matrix traveling through the network that understand the context, right? That's a very big differentiation from a technology perspective, but also from the team and other companies on what they're protecting or not protecting, right? It's not, it's, it's, it's moving very rapidly. It's moving away from a pure InfoSec problem, yeah, to a more business risk a compliance problem there, if Vanguard's agents give you financial advice and you invest, or did the agents invest your money based on some random thing, then the task for CISO is to stopping those bad actions, not just data leakage,

Yeah, yeah. So we're one actually, last week we closed two more 150 plus accounts.
Yeah, yeah. So we're one actually, last week we closed two more 150 plus accounts.
Yeah, yeah. So we're one actually, last week we closed two more 150 plus accounts.
S Speaker 222:53close to 1.6 right now, which is again, with everything in the holidays and everything like, I just want
close to 1.6 right now, which is again, with everything in the holidays and everything like, I just want

close to 1.6 right now, which is again, with everything in the holidays and everything like, I just want
S Speaker 123:04to make two Yeah, yeah, yeah, no. I mean, 1.6 already higher than a lot of companies that were required. Like, 300 300k right? Literally nothing. I mean, no, I think that's so how do you see, would you think of yourself as an acquisition target, or are you now,
to make two Yeah, yeah, yeah, no. I mean, 1.6 already higher than a lot of companies that were required. Like, 300 300k right? Literally nothing. I mean, no, I think that's so how do you see, would you think of yourself as an acquisition target, or are you now,

S Speaker 223:28like, like, 10s of billions, like, I mean, like, think of this literally at an inflection point where areas are starting to happen. Yeah, they need us to go to production like, we're literally the last quarter, like they need to talk for and that's, it's two years from now. Three years from now, you'll be looking at an agent workforce, right? Like you're mentioning that you'll have agents across, right? That's the vision, and that's where, like, imagine,
like, like, 10s of billions, like, I mean, like, think of this literally at an inflection point where areas are starting to happen.

24:00like, the size of the company?
like, the size of the company?
like, the size of the company?
like, the size of the company?
S Speaker 124:04No, I mean the potential, the potential is there for sure, and that we are excited about this space and talking to a few more companies to better articulate, right? So, so how do we maybe you know when you compare yourself with others? Would you say that, what are the Are there any benchmarks, or are there any metrics on which you compare yourself?
No, I mean the potential, the potential is there for sure, and that we are excited about this space and talking to a few more companies to better articulate, right?

S Speaker 127:15Yep, yep. So this is so, of course, I I understand policy to protection loop, right, which we've discussed quite a bit. Yeah, agent for security is also interesting, because you talked about it deployed within an agent, right? So, you know, you're effectively, from what I remember, it'll be a proxy, right, that will be installed within an agent,
Yep, yep. So this is so, of course, I I understand policy to protection loop, right, which we've discussed quite a bit.

S Speaker 229:23So from a safety leaderboard perspective, some of our customers, including NetApp, the way you use us is from the safety leaderboard, the AI governance councils are making decisions in which models to procure or not procure, right?
