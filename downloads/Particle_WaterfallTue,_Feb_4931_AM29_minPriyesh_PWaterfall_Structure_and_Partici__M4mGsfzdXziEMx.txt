1:35So let me show you.
S Speaker 11:38I'm rebuilding our waterfall from scratch, because the current Waterfall has all the structure in it. And so it makes sense to just start over when we're doing the the structure of the round really clears all that out. So just let me kind of walk you through the pieces here, right the

S Speaker 12:06this waterfall, sort of like shows payouts by stakeholder at different at different numbers. This is the sort of like worst case for you. This is not where it will end up. Every version of an approach to improve this improves it from here, right? It's just a question of what approach and what you know, what I can get across. And so the but the way this works, structurally speaking, is series one

S Speaker 12:41The it has a fixed preference stack, meaning that after all of the movement preference, which we'll come back and talk to in a second, there is $1 figure that is the total preference stack, basically trying to hold it steady, right? So, like preference deck prior is about 130 preference stack. After is

S Speaker 12:59and the same amount of money goes out the door to the preferred stack as as if this round had happened. But what happens inside of that? Kind of gets cleaned up. Non participants get a 10 to one ground down. Push to comment. I haven't modeled common yet, so you'll see that all of these numbers like, stop and they don't go any further. That's not because they wouldn't it's because I feel preferred. And then was like, Okay, I really am. I'm starting with trying to figure out for everybody, and then I'll layer on common afterwards, the

S Speaker 13:45is they're putting in 2 million of additional debt. They've put in the first million already, the second million, we can draw any time, or it will automatically draw when we close the series one. So there's 2 million of additional debt coming in, but at a high price, right? So they're taking a 3x lip graph, although it ratchets the more money investors come in. This actually comes down from here, but right now, I have a 3x

4:12the we then have,
S Speaker 14:15we have in place a transaction bonus plan, which is essentially what the management team has in place to incentivize us to sell, even if the preference stack that is going to be changed a little bit, because one of the things that avenue required is that there be a management incentive package at the bottom of the stack. Basically they said, hey, look, let's say this whole thing goes off the fucking rails and it's not going to sell in a way that's going to return equity capital, we as the bank still need the management team to be incentivized to sell it for us, right? And so they defined what amounts to like a minimum transaction, like bonus for the management team. And then what I'm doing is then pulling down our we had a 15% of proceeds, but only funded from the preferred part of the stack. I'm pulling it down to 12, and we're working on that number, but the goal is to make it so like the management team isn't getting any rich out of the situation. Like, if we get to something like 100 million, it's the same payout for management. So it's a little more if it's less than that, and it's less if it's more than that, the we're also proposing that the first million dollars of that the good employees, rather than the management team. So we're doing a RIF, and so there's going to be about 62 people at the team following the Rif. 12 are management. So there's 50 other people that we need to make sure are like, well, retained through the M and a process. And our plan is to basically save the million dollar pool that we will allocate out to those 50 team members and say, Hey, stick with us through the M and A process, and you get x dollars. So then transaction costs. We have bank moles this. It's a minimum of three to five, and then it grows. But I haven't built in the growth of higher values yet. SVB from prior debt has a deferred fee. That is a transaction cost. We're then assuming another million transaction costs the senior debt. There's currently 17 and a half from Avenue, then another 6.6 which is basically this additional two with pref the their management incentive plan. Then there's the convertible note. So, so the preference stack is transaction costs, debt, then the convertible notes that we did six months ago, and then preferred, and then common preferred. After all of this will be a single series. So what you're buying is series one. Everything else gets turned into common and then pulled up into series one. So there's only a single series that's left at the end of this. The now, what your, what any party's payouts are calculated here

S Speaker 28:00Yeah. I mean, at this point, everybody's agreed to the structure and then so I understand the reference here. So thanks for going through that, so that,
Yeah. I mean, at this point, everybody's agreed to the structure and then so I understand the reference here. So thanks for going through that, so that,
Yeah. I mean, at this point, everybody's agreed to the structure and then so I understand the reference here. So thanks for going through that, so that,
Yeah. I mean, at this point, everybody's agreed to the structure and then so I understand the reference here. So thanks for going through that, so that,
S Speaker 28:16and so, so now I think let's so two things, I do have a hard stop at 10. So let's talk about two things. One, I also want to spend five minutes about that COVID. Oh,
and so, so now I think let's so two things, I do have a hard stop at 10. So let's talk about two things. One, I also want to spend five minutes about that COVID. Oh,

S Speaker 29:41there are a couple, what's the waterfall impact? Like, what's the

there are a couple, what's the waterfall impact? Like, what's the
S Speaker 19:45so this would basically have you, like, if we look at, let's take, like, 100 or 150 right? Just as a
so this would basically have you, like, if we look at, let's take, like, 100 or 150 right? Just as a

9:57your convertible note,
your convertible note,
your convertible note,
your convertible note,
S Speaker 110:02right? And so that converts it to 2x so your convertible note pays out first. And so in the you know the worst outcome that always pays out. And then
right? And so that converts it to 2x so your convertible note pays out first. And so in the you know the worst outcome that always pays out. And then
right? And so that converts it to 2x so your convertible note pays out first. And so in the you know the worst outcome that always pays out. And then
right? And so that converts it to 2x so your convertible note pays out first. And so in the you know the worst outcome that always pays out. And then
S Speaker 210:17this is after the late prep, before this, right? Yeah, that's correct. Yep, that's right. And so
this is after the late prep, before this, right? Yeah, that's correct. Yep, that's right. And so
this is after the late prep, before this, right? Yeah, that's correct. Yep, that's right. And so
this is after the late prep, before this, right? Yeah, that's correct. Yep, that's right. And so
S Speaker 110:27you can see, like, at 50, the convertible note pays out, but like, that's kind of it, right. Like, there's a little bit, there's only $2 million of preference to go around at that point. At 100 the lick prep stays the same. And you can see, as we go up like the the preferred, you know, increases with it. Now, if we said,
you can see, like, at 50, the convertible note pays out, but like, that's kind of it, right. Like, there's a little bit, there's only $2 million of preference to go around at that point. At 100 the lick prep stays the same. And you can see, as we go up like the the preferred, you know, increases with it. Now, if we said,

10:50you know, you did, oops,
you know, you did, oops,
you know, you did, oops,
you know, you did, oops,
S Speaker 110:52you did the full this, by the way, assumes everybody participates,
you did the full this, by the way, assumes everybody participates,
you did the full this, by the way, assumes everybody participates,
you did the full this, by the way, assumes everybody participates,
10:58which, right now, like,
which, right now, like,
which, right now, like,
which, right now, like,
S Speaker 111:01actually, it's worth noting. I A lot of this is non board investors, who I've only started to talk to about this recently, so I haven't gotten confirmation from them.
actually, it's worth noting. I A lot of this is non board investors, who I've only started to talk to about this recently, so I haven't gotten confirmation from them.

11:10If we just do, like, participating,
If we just do, like, participating,
If we just do, like, participating,
If we just do, like, participating,
S Speaker 111:12who do I have confirmation from, right? Like, if, if nobody else participates, then your, you know, your payout comes up to like 13 three.
who do I have confirmation from, right? Like, if, if nobody else participates, then your, you know, your payout comes up to like 13 three.
who do I have confirmation from, right? Like, if, if nobody else participates, then your, you know, your payout comes up to like 13 three.
who do I have confirmation from, right? Like, if, if nobody else participates, then your, you know, your payout comes up to like 13 three.
11:23Now let's say you do full participation,
Now let's say you do full participation,
Now let's say you do full participation,
Now let's say you do full participation,
S Speaker 111:29your payout comes up to 18 five. Now you might say, Well, wait a second, why am I still not getting 1x li pref in that case, this is because, sorry, I'm looking here like you're looking at the $200 million line, yeah, but I'm just looking at like, because, it's because the only thing that's in here is common
your payout comes up to 18 five. Now you might say, Well, wait a second, why am I still not getting 1x li pref in that case, this is because, sorry, I'm looking here like you're looking at the $200 million line, yeah, but I'm just looking at like, because, it's because the only thing that's in here is common

11:48or sorry, is preferred,
or sorry, is preferred,
or sorry, is preferred,
or sorry, is preferred,
S Speaker 211:49yeah? But I'm looking at, let's take a look at the 100 scenario, yeah, okay,
yeah? But I'm looking at, let's take a look at the 100 scenario, yeah, okay,
yeah? But I'm looking at, let's take a look at the 100 scenario, yeah, okay,
yeah? But I'm looking at, let's take a look at the 100 scenario, yeah, okay,
S Speaker 111:57sure. So you're looking at, you know, fate in that case, and then in case of
sure. So you're looking at, you know, fate in that case, and then in case of
sure. So you're looking at, you know, fate in that case, and then in case of
sure. So you're looking at, you know, fate in that case, and then in case of
12:03the if you Don't do 100% if you did,
the if you Don't do 100% if you did,
the if you Don't do 100% if you did,
the if you Don't do 100% if you did,
S Speaker 112:18yeah, six. Now the part of the reason you end up looking a little worse than other parties, just as a start, even if, even if, you do full participation, is because you're you have these common warrants that expired. So the I talked to Cooley about that, I think we have a mechanism to unexpire them, because I think this was just kind of like a nobody noticed that they were coming up, sort of a thing. And I think it's fair to say that if you guys are participating in a meaningful way, that we can, that we can, like, probably get approval to just sort of fix that to see what that would look like. I'm just going to go hard code. I think it's about 8 million. Okay, so I'm going to giving you back 8 million. Yeah, common warrants. Those get pulled up into the into the preference stack, because of the way this thing is structured. And so now if we look at that same waterfall, whoops. Your you. If you do full participation now, you're at 10, or, you know, 1824, right, like, now you're into the
yeah, six. Now the part of the reason you end up looking a little worse than other parties, just as a start, even if, even if, you do full participation, is because you're you have these common warrants that expired.

And I think it's fair to say that if you guys are participating in a meaningful way, that we can, that we can, like, probably get approval to just sort of fix that to see what that would look like. I'm just going to go hard code. I think it's about 8 million. Okay, so I'm going to giving you back 8 million. Yeah, common warrants. Those get pulled up into the into the preference stack, because of the way this thing is structured. And so now if we look at that same waterfall, whoops. Your you. If you do full participation now, you're at 10, or, you know, 1824, right, like, now you're into the
yeah, six.

yeah, yes, that's right.
S Speaker 113:50That's right. And so I think, like, that's kind of like a freebie, right? Like, Well, I think we can just do that. So the other way, the other way that we could play it. Um, it is, let me, let me see. Okay, if I go back, undo that right,

17:35So that's a data point.
So that's a data point.
So that's a data point.
So that's a data point.
17:38So you should have

started that. I told you that already. That was the one from last year.
started that. I told you that already. That was the one from last year.

17:59Okay, so that's good to know.
Okay, so that's good to know.
Okay, so that's good to know.
Okay, so that's good to know.
S Speaker 218:03That's good to know. So if that's I still think that that'll take longer, because these PE shops, have they done the acquisition of the other one that they were going to do, that they were going to take private? No, it's in flight. So that is that's going to happen first in these PE shops, then starting, right. So, okay, so, so, but, but like that'll happen if it'll happen, and then when, then otherwise we think it's lower. And then it might not make sense. However, I have a clear line of shot actually getting you a lot more dollars, more than the investment, which is what we discussed about getting you payments for Krishna said That's a done deal, like that's done deal, and so he's gonna we just have To make sure that we get him that proposal soon enough. Okay? And and discuss that right, like, which is 10? How many do you need? 10,000 20,000 30,000
That's good to know. So if that's I still think that that'll take longer, because these PE shops, have they done the acquisition of the other one that they were going to do, that they were going to take private?

19:10so, yeah, okay, so,
S Speaker 219:13so I have a way to get you more dollars, but through ventures, it's getting harder and harder.
so I have a way to get you more dollars, but through ventures, it's getting harder and harder.
so I have a way to get you more dollars, but through ventures, it's getting harder and harder.
so I have a way to get you more dollars, but through ventures, it's getting harder and harder.
S Speaker 219:29my So, my question to you is, is there another, any other math that still gets us, because with 500k right, any more than that is, is we're essentially saying we're trying to protect not much, right? I like all they're doing is we're going to maybe protect the current capital, right? So which then why we take, why do we take that risk?
my So, my question to you is, is there another, any other math that still gets us, because with 500k right, any more than that is, is we're essentially saying we're trying to protect not much, right?

20:57structure it for
S Speaker 221:01I mean, that's give us. We're hoping to get this done within the next two months. Yeah, okay, but these procurement and all this could take time and everything, so we should pad it enough for, like, I don't know, eight nine months at least,
I mean, that's give us. We're hoping to get this done within the next two months. Yeah, okay, but these procurement and all this could take time and everything, so we should pad it enough for, like, I don't know, eight nine months at least,

21:17and then eight nine months,
and then eight nine months,
and then eight nine months,
and then eight nine months,
S Speaker 221:19I mean, padded till then. So, because I'm pretty sure, like, by eight, nine months, there's nothing, I mean, it's more like,
I mean, padded till then. So, because I'm pretty sure, like, by eight, nine months, there's nothing, I mean, it's more like,
I mean, padded till then. So, because I'm pretty sure, like, by eight, nine months, there's nothing, I mean, it's more like,
I mean, padded till then. So, because I'm pretty sure, like, by eight, nine months, there's nothing, I mean, it's more like,
S Speaker 121:27that's our like, we're gonna be sold by them. So I think the
that's our like, we're gonna be sold by them. So I think the
that's our like, we're gonna be sold by them. So I think the
that's our like, we're gonna be sold by them. So I think the
S Speaker 221:32so maybe six months, let's, let's do six months, just in case, because things can change. But you don't want to go back and do the paperwork. Things can change for the company in a lot of different ways, right? Like, as we know, yeah, I think,
so maybe six months, let's, let's do six months, just in case, because things can change. But you don't want to go back and do the paperwork. Things can change for the company in a lot of different ways, right? Like, as we know, yeah, I think,

S Speaker 222:36think the problem is procurement and everything like we can do start the conversation. Then they can come into the contract and everything, and then the paperwork can start getting processed. Yeah, as we know, like this, paperwork end up taking
think the problem is procurement and everything like we can do start the conversation. Then they can come into the contract and everything, and then the paperwork can start getting processed. Yeah, as we know, like this, paperwork end up taking
think the problem is procurement and everything like we can do start the conversation. Then they can come into the contract and everything, and then the paperwork can start getting processed. Yeah, as we know, like this, paperwork end up taking
think the problem is procurement and everything like we can do start the conversation. Then they can come into the contract and everything, and then the paperwork can start getting processed. Yeah, as we know, like this, paperwork end up taking
S Speaker 122:51longer, so as long as we have a signed contract for it,
longer, so as long as we have a signed contract for it,
longer, so as long as we have a signed contract for it,
longer, so as long as we have a signed contract for it,
S Speaker 222:56like that contract is, you know, for walk on is you had to go through procurement, legal, everything, yeah,
like that contract is, you know, for walk on is you had to go through procurement, legal, everything, yeah,
like that contract is, you know, for walk on is you had to go through procurement, legal, everything, yeah,
like that contract is, you know, for walk on is you had to go through procurement, legal, everything, yeah,
S Speaker 123:04I just don't think, practically speaking, I can get away with giving you guys a pull up, right? That basically is an option to pull up for what would amount to the entirety of the m&a process, right? Yeah,
I just don't think, practically speaking, I can get away with giving you guys a pull up, right? That basically is an option to pull up for what would amount to the entirety of the m&a process, right? Yeah,
I just don't think, practically speaking, I can get away with giving you guys a pull up, right? That basically is an option to pull up for what would amount to the entirety of the m&a process, right? Yeah,
I just don't think, practically speaking, I can get away with giving you guys a pull up, right? That basically is an option to pull up for what would amount to the entirety of the m&a process, right? Yeah,
23:15but I'm gonna be able to pull it
but I'm gonna be able to pull it
but I'm gonna be able to pull it
but I'm gonna be able to pull it
S Speaker 223:17off. I mean, that's based on revenues, right? Like, that's based on that's based on us getting you revenue. So if I can get you the revenue, then should be, I mean, then that that, I mean, that makes it prettier as well for selling. So
off. I mean, that's based on revenues, right? Like, that's based on that's based on us getting you revenue. So if I can get you the revenue, then should be, I mean, then that that, I mean, that makes it prettier as well for selling. So
off. I mean, that's based on revenues, right? Like, that's based on that's based on us getting you revenue. So if I can get you the revenue, then should be, I mean, then that that, I mean, that makes it prettier as well for selling. So
off. I mean, that's based on revenues, right? Like, that's based on that's based on us getting you revenue. So if I can get you the revenue, then should be, I mean, then that that, I mean, that makes it prettier as well for selling. So
S Speaker 123:36I can try. I think that. I think, like, six months is too long, right? The our process is being time, bound by Avenue, regardless. But this was the process, this was the timeline that we were anticipating either way. So we're,
I can try. I think that. I think, like, six months is too long, right? The our process is being time, bound by Avenue, regardless. But this was the process, this was the timeline that we were anticipating either way. So we're,
I can try. I think that. I think, like, six months is too long, right? The our process is being time, bound by Avenue, regardless. But this was the process, this was the timeline that we were anticipating either way. So we're,
I can try. I think that. I think, like, six months is too long, right? The our process is being time, bound by Avenue, regardless. But this was the process, this was the timeline that we were anticipating either way. So we're,
S Speaker 223:52we have to give it like a minimum of four months, because otherwise, like sitting in fab,
we have to give it like a minimum of four months, because otherwise, like sitting in fab,
we have to give it like a minimum of four months, because otherwise, like sitting in fab,
we have to give it like a minimum of four months, because otherwise, like sitting in fab,
S Speaker 224:04these guys should be because if it's April, GA and they want to launch in April, these guys should be signing this and even giving you money, right? They want to do pre orders and everything within the next month. So
these guys should be because if it's April, GA and they want to launch in April, these guys should be signing this and even giving you money, right? They want to do pre orders and everything within the next month. So
these guys should be because if it's April, GA and they want to launch in April, these guys should be signing this and even giving you money, right? They want to do pre orders and everything within the next month. So
these guys should be because if it's April, GA and they want to launch in April, these guys should be signing this and even giving you money, right? They want to do pre orders and everything within the next month. So
24:21I'm just padding
S Speaker 124:23for I know, I just, I know you want to pad. I don't think I can give you the padding. I can. I think I can give you, I think I can give you an accommodation. I don't, well, I should say I need to talk to Cooley. I can try to give you the accommodation. And I feel like that'll probably fly. But I think getting past April 13, the second close I think is like, I don't. I think we have to take the if it doesn't happen in this time frame, you will always have a shot at that moment of putting in the last 250 if you wanted to right, you'll have up until the last day of the second close. If you were like, shit, it's gonna happen, but I'm not going to get it right. But like, I'm excited about the prospects here and now I'm ready to, like, put in that last little bit, just to preserve as much of my ownership, right? And so I think it's like, giving you one of those two levers to pull up until that date, and then we just try to make it happen in that time
for I know, I just, I know you want to pad. I don't think I can give you the padding. I can. I think I can give you, I think I can give you an accommodation. I don't, well, I should say I need to talk to Cooley. I can try to give you the accommodation. And I feel like that'll probably fly.

S Speaker 225:20frame. All right, so get back to me on that. Okay, I think. But April 2, close, you have to add it a little more, procurement, Qualcomm, legal, all this stuff, and then we haven't started that process. And and Krishna and T for new to that process, right?
frame. All right, so get back to me on that. Okay, I think. But April 2, close, you have to add it a little more, procurement, Qualcomm, legal, all this stuff, and then we haven't started that process. And and Krishna and T for new to that process, right?

S Speaker 225:45I should have included, okay, so you know, like, let me know when you're sending that email. I've got a person on our team now that's man doing like, portfolio management, portfolio development. So he can be like, I can allocate him to work with you and Krishna to make sure that that contract ends. Okay, all right,
