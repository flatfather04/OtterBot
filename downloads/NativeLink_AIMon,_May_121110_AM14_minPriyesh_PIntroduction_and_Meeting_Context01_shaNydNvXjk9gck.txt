S Speaker 10:28How are you? Priyesh, hey, hi, Marcus, I'm doing great. Thanks a lot for asking. How are you? I'm all right, and thanks for being flexible. I know I had to change the meeting last Monday due to some personal emergency, but thank you for being okay. Yes, yes, it's fine. Now, yeah, I had to make a travel back home urgently for something, but things are back now. Where's back home? India, right? So, where you base? Marcus. Are you in SF? I'm based in Palo, alto, okay, perfect, perfect. I'm in the bay area as well. That's where our ventures team is,

1:09that's not far from
S Speaker 11:11me. Yes, yes, yeah, it's easy, like our offices are down in Santa Clara, and then many a times I have to go up to the city. So it's easier that way. So Marcus, just setting the context here for the conversation. Very broadly, we are looking at physical AI as an investment thesis within the ventures team here at Qualcomm ventures. And at the same time, we believe physical AI is a very big strategic area for Qualcomm as well. We priyadh chips, which now go on to multiple devices, multiple platforms in Edge, IoT PCs, mobiles, XR devices. So we believe we would have a big, plain physical AI down the line. And hence looking at it very strategically from an investment perspective, also from perspective of whether we can foster some business unit collaborations at the same time. So particularly driving that thesis internally within the team myself and at the moment, I've spoken to a lot of, I would say, AI model building companies. We have taken some close look at some of those. And I now want to extend my research a little bit more on the infrastructure there, particularly don't come from a technical background. So this space is a slightly more, I would say, difficult for me to understand, but I have done probably some research on trucking machine. I guess that is what you like to call it. So I've done some research there, but would love to understand what you're building from your own words. How do you see the vision of it coming in the future?
me. Yes, yes, yeah, it's easy, like our offices are down in Santa Clara, and then many a times I have to go up to the city. So it's easier that way.

S Speaker 22:54Yeah, I just think that, you know, 45% of the GDP is in the physical world. Yes. So that's where the growth area is, industrial automation, transportation, logistics, their military applications, like where things are going to search and rescue is where we're seeing another area we're seeing traction, like where the growth and intelligence is going to be

3:38and where, yes, sorry, good. So
and where, yes, sorry, good. So

and where, yes, sorry, good. So
S Speaker 23:41like we want to sit as the software layer in between the hardware and the algorithms, like building systems that are hermetic and can cross compile to exotic hardware and a variegated set of platforms, operating systems, instruction sets. That's really what we think, and that's why we call ourselves native link.

S Speaker 14:04Yeah, native links to everything. So the plan here Marcus is to build very hardware agnostic at the same time, what, what are some of the use cases, or, let's say, first, what are some of the hardware you plan to be supporting in the near term? Where are you seeing traction? So
Yeah, native links to everything. So the plan here Marcus is to build very hardware agnostic at the same time, what, what are some of the use cases, or, let's say, first, what are some of the hardware you plan to be supporting in the near term? Where are you seeing traction? So

6:08And so then I was looking at
And so then I was looking at
And so then I was looking at
And so then I was looking at
S Speaker 36:11available remote execution back ends, and that's how I came across native link as on just some random list. Well, actually, I think it was, yeah, yeah. So, I mean, would you describe native link as, like, simulate, simulate, like, what sounds more relevant? Like a simulation infrastructure tool or a remote execution back end tool? Like, what kept legacy? I mean in terms of my, of our immediate needs, then the current capabilities is addressing those.

S Speaker 36:55I mean, because it's, yeah, I guess it's like combination, right? It's the whole shebang execution, plus caching and all that, all the pieces that you need in order to create your infrastructure that scales. Yeah,

S Speaker 47:12yeah, what's um, so, so I understand that it's in native link is being used in Samsung's production software,

7:21yeah, so we are using it in
yeah, so we are using it in
yeah, so we are using it in
yeah, so we are using it in
S Speaker 37:30Like, say, for example, we have some kind of mixed workload where you need to do some GPU stuff. We use custom or, you know, like, difficult Source Hardware, GPUs and like, versus, like, just regulars.

worries, no worries. I know it like man says It's almost
S Speaker 38:00bedtime, right? Yeah, so, yeah. So anyway, basically, yeah. Had some, some built in areas where we got these custom or, you know, like, difficult Source Hardware CPUs and like, versus, like, just regular CPUs. Also Qualcomm tips, yeah. I mean, like, say, for example, you have some kind of mixed workload where you need to do some GPU stuff, you need to do some symptom intensive stuff, etc. Like, you have a hard time getting individual bits COVID That would do all of all those things. You know, you can split up and push them to where work is done more effectively. Then that'll scale better. That's awesome, without getting into anything great value prop, obviously
bedtime, right? Yeah, so, yeah. So anyway, basically, yeah.

S Speaker 48:40quantify, like, the time saved. You know, with native link, is there? Do you have any like idea, like, days, weeks, months in your head of what it would take if you didn't have native link?
quantify, like, the time saved. You know, with native link, is there? Do you have any like idea, like, days, weeks, months in your head of what it would take if you didn't have native link?

8:54but like at the extreme end,
but like at the extreme end,
but like at the extreme end,
but like at the extreme end,
S Speaker 38:58basically like running, running the original stuff on specialized hardware without any acceleration at all, versus the sort of segmented solution using native link. Basically, I think we were looking at the scale of the process originally taking like two or three days and scaling down to about an hour and one to two hours. So that's the kind of overall improvement that we've realized so far. So basically, from from day, from days to hours, which is, and like, I don't think our solution is even particularly efficient

S Speaker 19:45yeah, the ROI seems to be right there in front of everyone. That's That's pretty amazing. Marcus,
yeah, the ROI seems to be right there in front of everyone. That's That's pretty amazing. Marcus,

yeah, the ROI seems to be right there in front of everyone. That's That's pretty amazing. Marcus,
S Speaker 29:52so we're very happy. We're very proud of ourselves there. So,
so we're very happy. We're very proud of ourselves there. So,
so we're very happy. We're very proud of ourselves there. So,
so we're very happy. We're very proud of ourselves there. So,
S Speaker 19:56Marcus, I think on the web it just mentions the seed round. Have you? Have we already closed the a round as well.

No, we are going to, like this week, actually.
S Speaker 110:07Okay, so, so it guess, I guess in terms of timelines, like,
Okay, so, so it guess, I guess in terms of timelines, like,
Okay, so, so it guess, I guess in terms of timelines, like,
Okay, so, so it guess, I guess in terms of timelines, like,
S Speaker 210:14how do you all participate? How do you like to participate? Do you like to lead? Do you like to follow?
how do you all participate? How do you like to participate? Do you like to lead? Do you like to follow?
how do you all participate? How do you like to participate? Do you like to lead? Do you like to follow?
how do you all participate? How do you like to participate? Do you like to lead? Do you like to follow?
S Speaker 110:19So we typically process take, yeah, yes, yes. I haven't given you an overview of the fund so far. So our check sizes are typically between five to ten million sometimes we go a little bit smaller. I would say the minimum check size would be somewhere around 2 million.
