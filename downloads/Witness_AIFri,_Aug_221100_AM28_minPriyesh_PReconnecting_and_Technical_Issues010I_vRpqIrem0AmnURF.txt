S Speaker 20:16and it has been super crazy. I'm hoping my camera holds up. I have had it freeze in every meeting today, and I rebooted a couple times in the last 10 minutes. So if I freeze on you, you

S Speaker 10:27know, it's funny, I had the same issue almost two weeks ago. And, you know, it's funny, sometimes you restart it, but the restart takes time because so many files are open and it's just, it's just a long process. Yeah,

S Speaker 10:52But you know what's changing, and it's changed so much since we last spoke. Rick, right, and I'm sure you know security and how to safely adopt AI within Enterprise is still a massive pain point. I was just having a conversation with one of our head of it, and we were hitting upon the exact same point, right that you, that you're addressing. Before I go further, I wanted to introduce one of my colleagues, Priyesh, who's just joined us. Introduce yourself. Yeah, absolutely. Rick. I work with Deepak on some of our infra investments. I'm a Senior Associate here. When been with the Fund for about a year and a half, I've been in venture for three years prior to that, was working with a lot of early stage startups,

S Speaker 11:39I was hoping was, I mean, you know, this pain point came up within Qualcomm, and I was thinking, if, you know, we reconnect, get an update and see if Qualcomm can be a user, and if you guys are fundraising, or if there are plans to fundraise, I would love to stay in touch. That's where we left off last time. So, yeah, wanted to touch base again and see how things are, yeah,

S Speaker 22:04what's useful. Do I just jump in, or should I take a step back and give a little more of an intron company?

S Speaker 12:09I think maybe, like, a quick intro, a brief creation about the pain pointers they've seen, seen the deck, and we've prepped a little bit. But maybe, like, Okay, five, five to seven minute, like, if you can walk through a couple of slides, or, you know, if you however, you want to describe the company, and then we can go into, you know, what you've seen change in the last 12 months since, okay, yeah,
I think maybe, like, a quick intro, a brief creation about the pain pointers they've seen, seen the deck, and we've prepped a little bit.

S Speaker 22:28I'll just talk you through. I'll just, yeah, I forgot to set the deck, so I'll just talk you through. So, yeah, you know, listen, the company is two years old. We were incubated at ballistic ventures, and they looked at the market and said, We don't like any of the AI security startups. We're going to incubate our own. They brought over my co founder, Gil as CTO, and they brought me in as CEO. I go way back with all the ballistic guys, like 15 years. I think what we did different from most of the other AI security startups is, whereas they all started in what I would call the AI firewall part, which is companies standing up AI chat bots to their customers they want to protect you from prompt injection, yeah, and every see somebody talk to say, yeah, that's like a year or two away. You know, in 2023 and 2024 the problem they had was I have no governance and visibility over my employees. First, I have no idea what AI apps they're using. Then there were hundreds. Now there are 1000s. I don't know what data they're sharing. I don't know what these apps are sending back. So give me visibility and policy control over employee use first, yeah, and then give me the firewall and stuff later. So we did that flip, and it worked really well. Like, we've been, you know, I've been able to take big deals and big customers, or my competitors all kind of flamed out and got acquired. So, like I went to beta in June of last year with number one airline, Delta Airlines. They became my first customer, 700 grand a year, land deal, Southern Company, number two utility in the country. Yeah. Let's close the deal with them. Toyota just finished contracts with Toyota, so we're wrapping up the PO this week. Yeah. NTT. So third largest telco
I'll just talk you through. I'll just, yeah, I forgot to set the deck, so I'll just talk you through. So, yeah, you know, listen, the company is two years old.

S Speaker 14:30in the world, like we booked with NTT, we've invested with entity even though that Yeah. So, so I put 150,000
in the world, like we booked with NTT, we've invested with entity even though that Yeah. So, so I put 150,000
in the world, like we booked with NTT, we've invested with entity even though that Yeah. So, so I put 150,000
in the world, like we booked with NTT, we've invested with entity even though that Yeah. So, so I put 150,000
S Speaker 24:36NTT employees into production within 10 days of signing the contract. Wow. They I had a long call with them last night. They want to bring us as a they want to be a distributor of witness in Japan and run us as a managed service in Japan as well. So NTT is a customer. I did a $1.5 million land deal at NTT, just for observability outside of Japan. So I've got, like, number one airline, number one automaker, number two, utility. We just closed Schwab this week. Number one retail, financial, first retail CO. So we're basically selling relatively large deals to big enterprises. And the land deal is almost always employee AI, governance, compliance, so they can safely use it. That's almost always the first use case. Then the second use case at every company is, well, now we're turning on our own AI, we're exposing it to the employees. We're exposing it to the customers. We need prompt, injection, prevention, jailbreak for the B to C stuff. We want to make sure it doesn't give unwanted or harmful responses, like at every customer when they turn on the B to C chat bot. The first thing it does is recommend the competition. They want us to stop that. So the second use case is this, protect your enterprise AI from attack. Yeah. And then the one that's popping up now is the agentic stuff. And we were just working out our sensors to do agentic observability and control as well.

S Speaker 16:10That was, that was what about to go to next. But maybe firstly, like, Thanks for giving that update. It's phenomenal to see such good, large enterprise traction, you know, you kind of see middle market adopting it first. But the scale of entity, 120 1000 employees is just, you know, it's battle tested, right? So that's, that's great to see. I think, can we maybe unpack a little bit more around the visibility? And you when you talked about, you know, employee, AI governance, you know, what do you because I remember when we connected, it was a lot about prompt injection and making sure, you know, the right query is routed to either an on prem model or on top. Definitely part of it, yeah, because that's what I remember from my notes. And I was just going through where we left off, right? So, and I know you mentioned that you flipped the script, and you know, enterprises want what can be solved today. What's their biggest pain point today, which is visibility, which I understand, but can you unpack a little bit more on the governance and the visibility side? What exactly do you do?

S Speaker 27:15Yeah, that's the that's really the first case everywhere. So think of it like this. We don't have a browser plug in or an endpoint agent. We work at the network level. So we plug into the companies. They all have proxy like Zscaler Paulo or Netskope or Fortinet or something. We plug into that via third party chain. We basically say, for these, anything going to these 5000 external apps pass the traffic to us so we will see the employee where they're going. We use that their DNS information against our catalog to say, first off, here's just a here's the shadow AI, here's going right. Then we capture the conversation. So we show here's what they're doing when they're there, the prompt and the response, so the observability. Then we classify the prompts and responses for risk and for intention. So we have, like, a live AI model that runs in line that classifies prompts for intention. So intention might be, write a contract, write code, and so then we can say, look, I see what you're doing. I can tell you where all your employees are going. I can show you all the conversations. I've ranked them by risk. I've grouped them by intention. That's the observability piece. So you very quickly can see what's going on, you know, in your org. Then the second part is now, once they have that, then they turn on the policy part, the control part, yeah. So then you can say, well, if I'm looking at the conversations, and I can see that, like some set of people, their intention is to write a corporate contract with like some third party app like Gemini or chatgpt. Maybe I want to say only my legal department could do that, of course, and everyone else had walk in. But for the legal department, I want to redact any PII in the prompt and send the redacted prompt to Gemini. So we do all that on the fly and in line.
Yeah, that's the that's really the first case everywhere. So think of it like this. We don't have a browser plug in or an endpoint agent. We work at the network level. So we plug into the companies.

We basically say, for these, anything going to these 5000 external apps pass the traffic to us so we will see the employee where they're going. We use that their DNS information against our catalog to say, first off, here's just a here's the shadow AI, here's going right. Then we capture the conversation. So we show here's what they're doing when they're there, the prompt and the response, so the observability. Then we classify the prompts and responses for risk and for intention. So we have, like, a live AI model that runs in line that classifies prompts for intention. So intention might be, write a contract, write code, and so then we can say, look, I see what you're doing. I can tell you where all your employees are going. I can show you all the conversations. I've ranked them by risk. I've grouped them by intention. That's the observability piece. So you very quickly can see what's going on, you know, in your org. Then the second part is now, once they have that, then they turn on the policy part, the control part, yeah. So then you can say, well, if I'm looking at the conversations, and I can see that, like some set of people, their intention is to write a corporate contract with like some third party app like Gemini or chatgpt. Maybe I want to say only my legal department could do that, of course, and everyone else had walk in. But for the legal department, I want to redact any PII in the prompt and send the redacted prompt to Gemini. So we do all that on the fly and in line.
Yeah, that's the that's really the first case everywhere. So think of it like this. We don't have a browser plug in or an endpoint agent. We work at the network level. So we plug into the companies. They all have proxy like Zscaler Paulo or Netskope or Fortinet or something. We plug into that via third party chain. We basically say, for these, anything going to these 5000 external apps pass the traffic to us so we will see the employee where they're going.

But for the legal department, I want to redact any PII in the prompt and send the redacted prompt to Gemini. So we do all that on the fly and in line.
S Speaker 19:19And that's what I remember. So I remember the policy part more from the first conversation and from the first conversation, right? You touched upon something very interesting, right? So why wouldn't these proxies be able to map the accounts with the apps and figure out at least layer one of visibility? I'm not talking about the content per se, but to your point, right?
And that's what I remember. So I remember the policy part more from the first conversation and from the first conversation, right? You touched upon something very interesting, right? So why wouldn't these proxies be able to map the accounts with the apps and figure out at least layer one of visibility? I'm not talking about the content per se, but to your point, right?

So why wouldn't these proxies be able to map the accounts with the apps and figure out at least layer one of visibility? I'm not talking about the content per se, but to your point, right?
S Speaker 29:44It's the right question. It's really so here's the thing, like these, all these proxies, yeah, the pitch is very clear. They're like, look, AI, is just another DLP problem? Yeah, we're gonna, we're gonna find prompts with some DLP, with some bad, some private information, yeah. And we're just going to block it, block it, yeah. And so that's the pitch. So there's a couple things where that doesn't work well. One, they misclassify AI stuff all the time. I can Schwab an NTT and deploy it on top of cscaler, they misclassify crap all the time. So you say you're a company, and you say, Well, I don't. I only want the only AI my employees are allowed to use are like these three apps, yeah. And then they find that there's 20 other apps that Zscaler has not classified as an AI app, and they just let it through. So they apply no DLP filtering there, but we classify. So one is they just don't understand what AI is very well.
It's the right question. It's really so here's the thing, like these, all these proxies, yeah, the pitch is very clear. They're like, look, AI, is just another DLP problem? Yeah, we're gonna, we're gonna find prompts with some DLP, with some bad, some private information, yeah. And we're just going to block it, block it, yeah. And so that's the pitch.

So one is they just don't understand what AI is very well.
S Speaker 110:46So it's like, it's, it's an expertise challenge, not a platform challenge, right? The platform is capable. Let's say, if they were able to understand the application that somebody were to, you know, go deeper and understand, okay, this is so technology wise, they can execute. But you're saying expertise is not there, right?
So it's like, it's, it's an expertise challenge, not a platform challenge, right? The platform is capable. Let's say, if they were able to understand the application that somebody were to, you know, go deeper and understand, okay, this is so technology wise, they can execute.

Let's say, if they were able to understand the application that somebody were to, you know, go deeper and understand, okay, this is so technology wise, they can execute. But you're saying expertise is not there, right?
S Speaker 211:03The part part of the technology they can execute. What I'm saying is they can look at the prompt, yeah. The expertise part is to say, Well, I see that there's potentially PII, yeah. And I can block it, yeah. What they can't do is anything related to attention. So, you know, they can't say something like, Hey, if prompts are writing a contract or writing code, this group's allowed to do it, but that group isn't. They don't understand the attention part, so you have to be very specific around now you're back to all the downsides of DLP, yeah, so part of it is that the next thing is, there's lots of stuff that isn't. DLP, so writing risky prompts, writing prompts of like, how do I shoot my boss? How do I steal from the company? How do I quit? How do I quit without getting fired? How do I we get those benefits all the time. It's not. DLP, yeah, no. So they're not going to block it. They're not going to block it, yeah. And then they do nothing on the response. So, you know, you may get a response like, I've had multiple boards of directors ask, How do I keep third party. I keep reading about people killing themselves after talking to AI therapy. Apps, shopping again this week, right? There was a thing that went out on Monday, yeah? Like, how do I protect my weaker employees from that? I get that question that the first time we've heard it, we thought they were crazy. Like, yeah, talking about Yeah, and we built a harmful response guardrail on the response. But the proxies don't see that stuff. Yeah, they don't see that stuff. So, and some of the proxies, like Netskope, doesn't even log the prompts. They block and they don't log. So if you want to go back and look and see the conversations, yeah, can't. So there's that, there's other things like insider threat. There's all this other stuff around secure use stuff coming back. Second part is you don't put when you when you put out a B to C bot, like a delta. The first part of the deal was governance. Over 50,000 employees, all the stuff we just talked about, of course, then they came back and at this at CES in Las Vegas, their CEO announced they're putting up an AI Travel Planner, ticket seller on their on a Delta site.
The part part of the technology they can execute. What I'm saying is they can look at the prompt, yeah. The expertise part is to say, Well, I see that there's potentially PII, yeah.

13:33And we're protecting that too.
And we're protecting that too.
And we're protecting that too.
And we're protecting that too.
13:34You're protecting that too, yeah,
You're protecting that too, yeah,
You're protecting that too, yeah,
You're protecting that too, yeah,
S Speaker 213:35but like Zscaler isn't put in front of B to C apps. It's that, yeah, that's so now you're saying, Okay, now I need a second AI security product anyway, yeah, and our take was stupid, like you have one, you want one app to see all AI traffic everywhere, makes a single language, yes, single architecture. Yeah. Here's the next part. Many of the global companies we talked to, they've acquired other companies. They have subsidiaries. They have some Zscaler, they have some Netskope and a subsidiary. They have Paulo and company they just bought. But I work on all of those. Power doesn't work on Zscaler. Zscaler doesn't work on that. We have a POC at KPMG right now, yeah. KPMG global. KPMG has 120 countries subsidiaries, one in every country. Wow. Some are Paulo summer, Z scaler, some inesco Summer, Cisco. Some have no proxy. They each have country specific data requirements that may say, Well, my German AI data can't go to the US. Witness works across all the technologies. We can give them a witness instance in different regions. We did this with NTT. NTT has witness running in the Frankfurt region of AWS. They have another one running in Tokyo, yeah. And they have different data residency, data sovereignty and different data control policies, yep. So when you put it all together, you can say, well, I have a proxy. Can't they just block this? Like, yeah, sort of Yeah. But in practice, like, there's all kinds of other things that aren't that I get
but like Zscaler isn't put in front of B to C apps. It's that, yeah, that's so now you're saying, Okay, now I need a second AI security product anyway, yeah, and our take was stupid, like you have one, you want one app to see all AI traffic everywhere, makes a single language, yes, single architecture.

Like, yeah, sort of Yeah. But in practice, like, there's all kinds of other things that aren't that I get
S Speaker 115:15it, I get it and the and you kind of articulate it well, because it's not just AI is being adopted internally, externally. And you know, external apps, internal apps, there are multiple flavors of AI today and and if you have as at a corp level, if you have multiple of these fragmentations within your security stack, they don't talk to each other, you don't have a single pane of glass. So I think you're solving two problems there,
it, I get it and the and you kind of articulate it well, because it's not just AI is being adopted internally, externally. And you know, external apps, internal apps, there are multiple flavors of AI today and and if you have as at a corp level, if you have multiple of these fragmentations within your security stack, they don't talk to each other, you don't have a single pane of glass.

So I think you're solving two problems there,
S Speaker 215:40right? So the final thing I would say, because the question of like, Why can't the big guys do this? Yeah, you know, it's funny. I've been in security from the vendor side for 30 years, and that question has come up literally every time there's no thing, yeah, the way it goes, my answer is, look, the way it goes is, when's the last time Palo Alto Networks built anything 10 years ago, everything's acquisition. So what happens is a big wave happens? Yep, the big guys buy the small startups that don't get traction. One company comes across to be the next big one. Netskope did it for CASB did it for identity. CrowdStrike did it for EDR, like, yeah, we built this to do that for AI security.
right? So the final thing I would say, because the question of like, Why can't the big guys do this? Yeah, you know, it's funny.

S Speaker 116:25That's, that's great to great to see I was at RSA this year, and everything, every conversation was about agent tech security, right? Like, multiple of these. Well, how are you doing agents today? Or are you because? So the other question I have is, even within Qualcomm, we are deploying agents, but we are like, at the earliest stages, like even earlier than everybody. Everybody's right? So I'm sure you have some roadmap or some thoughts around how you'd be doing that, because they are not your typical software application, right? So, right. So we have a lot of multi term. There's also, like these secure sandboxes in which they run, right? So how do you how do you handle that architecture?
That's, that's great to great to see I was at RSA this year, and everything, every conversation was about agent tech security, right? Like, multiple of these. Well, how are you doing agents today?

So I'm sure you have some roadmap or some thoughts around how you'd be doing that, because they are not your typical software application, right? So, right. So we have a lot of multi term. There's also, like these secure sandboxes in which they run, right? So how do you how do you handle that architecture?

S Speaker 118:35but we're doing soft, you know, that's, that's not a, that's not a my team decision. That's, of course, you know, it falls, but that's good to good to know. I'll definitely bring it up because I'm in constant touch with the team that's building this. And, you know, it goes without saying it in a company like Qualcomm, this is of critical importance, right? You don't want your IP showing up in open source or in public somewhere, right? So, so that's, critical for us, and in terms of the business. So, Rick, how I remember you were at roughly around one, 1.5 when we spoke? I don't know how

S Speaker 220:43start in September, mid September, mid September, room and all the financials together right now, got it, got it, got it, got it. Okay, I've got a ton of interest. The Insiders offered to take the whole round. But I want a new lead. Yeah, I want a new board member. Yeah, we have two ballistic guys on the board. One of them is going to leave and give that seat to whoever leads. So my thinking is, I will, I will start this round like mid September. Yeah, I'll look for a lead. I've talked to a bunch of lead potential leads. They're all pretty interested. A bunch of follow ons and strategics, like a bunch of corporate strategics are interested, which I'm interested in having them. Yeah, my thinking is I'm probably raising around 50 million. Very nice. Okay, the direction from the board was, go raise enough to not go back out for 24 months, but still push the gas. Yeah. So I think 50, maybe up to 60, but probably say 5050, ish, 5055, yeah, that that allows me. If I raise less than that, I have to go out again too soon. More than that, I dilute too much, too much, yeah, or I have to ask for a stupid valuation like you just said that I'll never grow into a time, right? So I'm trying to raise 5055, kind of thinking, post money around 400 maybe got it, got it, got it, got it. No, that's any of this year 10 should get me there.

S Speaker 124:18There's no rush. We can, we can grab, you know, coffee at San Antonio, or is at Castro Street. And, you know, but looking forward to working together. Rick, any questions for us in terms of, you know, how we run the process, or what it might take the rest, yeah, I guess the question is,
There's no rush. We can, we can grab, you know, coffee at San Antonio, or is at Castro Street. And, you know, but looking forward to working together. Rick, any questions for us in terms of, you know, how we run the process, or what it might take the rest, yeah, I guess the question is,

S Speaker 224:36you know, corporate ventures are typically like, a strategic like, is there some way you like to operate? Like, is there a certain kind of lead, a certain kind of, like, how do you
you know, corporate ventures are typically like, a strategic like, is there some way you like to operate? Like, is there a certain kind of lead, a certain kind of, like, how do you

you know, corporate ventures are typically like, a strategic like, is there some way you like to operate? Like, is there a certain kind of lead, a certain kind of, like, how do you
S Speaker 124:45so, what's like? That's a great, that's a great question, right? I think the word corporate venture comes with a lot of, you know, implicit understanding of how it operates, right? So we the way we've worked, and we've This is our 25th year of existence. So we've been in, seen cycles, and we've worked with all kinds of corporates and financial investors. Think of it as a pendulum between strategic and financial. We are more we think of ourselves as more of a financial investor, right? And so we don't need, like, a formal agreement. We don't need a formal contract or, like exclusive partnership to make, or even a business sponsor right to make a deal. So we'll do that independently. What I would caveat it is, since it's a single LP fund, it's coming out of balance sheet, we have to be somewhat answerable to the LP. What it means is, it could be a loose thread, which is as good as, hey, you know, they can be customer, you know, in the next 12 months. And guess what? They can be used across and the enterprise, right? So, so in this case, it's pretty strong, and it's very relevant, and the timing is perfect, because I was just talking to this lady, and I'll introduce you to her next time she's she's based out of the Santa Clara office at Qualcomm, okay? And, and you know, you'll, you'll enjoy meeting her, and you know how she is thinking about security within Qualcomm, but, but that's the So, to answer your question, there's no dedicated ownership. There's no set of financial investors or strategic that we want to work with or not, either way we would, we would do the deal based on the deals merit, right? So it's a purely investment decision,
so, what's like? That's a great, that's a great question, right? I think the word corporate venture comes with a lot of, you know, implicit understanding of how it operates, right?

S Speaker 126:41to meet. Rick. One thing I love is, what about so you cracking the problem at the enterprise level, right? What about personal like so we are in the home router business, right? And we do enterprise routers as well. I know that's not somewhere you want to go.

let me think about it, yeah, because I completely get
S Speaker 127:11that. You know, enterprise is the play Go to player. But you know, if you think about AI adoption, it's everywhere, and personal and commercial is merging in a way, right?
