S Speaker 23:18Yeah, we'd love to hear some other Qualcomm interest. We did actually just raise like a round pretty recently as like a price round in general, in terms of growth, like, be roughly, like eight or 9x in like, the last five months, almost worth double a month over month. Single account executive on the team we're now, we've raised additional capital to essentially grow up our go to market team, and then we have significant, you know, win losses in our favor against each of our early stage competitors. And I think just in general, the paradox getting acquired, there's a huge opportunity to take over a part of that market in kind of a frontline worker space, but then also kind of take over the market that hire you has. That's a lot of these companies doing kind of new grad hiring through HireVue. Yeah, that's where part of the opportunity. But they're also going way beyond just an AI voice interviewer, end to end engagement screening for a variety of mechanisms to using that data to better source candidates over time. So they're collecting all that info, yes, and then going beyond that as well, that like automation within one ATF, htm, HRIS, data, intelligence on top of our platform. And so that's going to be the future of where we're heading. That I think it's like super, super exciting, but just in general, for seeing huge growth,

S Speaker 27:04I think we can jump straight into things. Yeah, take a look at your electrical background, probably with background myself with the University of Waterloo, originally with a software engineer when I graduated school, they transitioned into product management with always working on zero to one products and always deeply technical product but with the early Product Manager for Microsoft, team coach work on the recommendation systems for Instagram reel, who are actually built out our content based recommendation system. Yeah. So that's where our employer really handling a lot of high volume hiring, especially for the data labelers that we were bringing onto the platform or onto the team to label and build models from. That's a little bit about my background. I've always been very entrepreneurial. And me and my co founder, have you known each other for over 13 years at this point, second company together and build projects together well as well, which is where we met.

S Speaker 17:59That's super interesting. Shavashan, like Microsoft Teams and Instagram reels are on, say, two different parts of the spectrum, even, even from the products I like and use quite a lot versus product I don't like, but still have to use quite a lot. So that's, that's super interesting. But I worked

S Speaker 28:21like, I had some involvement there, but more on, like, getting enterprises to adopt at scale and whatnot. But yeah, I Yeah. I mean,

S Speaker 18:30for sure, and to that point, great job at less getting a lot of enterprises to adopt Microsoft Teams, right? We use it all day. But coming back to Hey, Milo shabash, and super interesting. How did you start? Like, what was the wedge that you started? And maybe from my POV, the way I sort of bifurcate this entire market is you have a sourcing piece to the entire funnel, then you have the interviewing and grading piece to the funnel, and then you have closing the loop where you collect data and see if the entire sort of system and engine is working right way, and you fine tune it. Are there more ways to think about this? And from what, which did you start? How are you planning to expand you? You already covered some part of it.

S Speaker 29:15But I think, like, initially started, like a voice AI interviewer, like the idea was, like, I like, when I was scaling out the data labeling team or even interviewing folks for engineering or management role, I was spending a lot of time interviewing these folks, the idea of, like LMV started growing in popularity. It's like, it makes sense to add a voice interface to kind of, you know, do a part of a job that I thought could be scaled right. From there, it expanded quite a bit. You eventually realized, like, not every single applicant that comes in down for a role should go through a voice AI interview. There's a lot of just candidates. So we started building additional ways to kind of filter out candidates. So you added, like, actual resume screening, document screening, SMS screening, for certain roles. You started seeing a lot of demand in, like factory workers, like industrial hourly workers. And we realized that that flow is a little bit different without some mass screening followed by a phone call interview, for example. As we started continuing to build we obviously started seeing like the amount of candidate fraud going on in the market. So we added more ways to detect cheating and out. And I could talk quite extensively about the set of stuff that we did there, but high level after that, we realized interviewing like 1000s of people you know, every single day at the point on our platform, but they're constantly going out and putting out new job postings when they need to hire the same role. They're not reusing the data. So we started doing feedback loops where, when you're hiring, a game, previously screened candidates can be resurfaced for those roles. And that's been, like, a big focus over the last quarter or so, and so one of the things that we have done to really differentiate ourselves is like, only that ends when not just being a voice AI interviewer and going really deep on the product. And I think that's why, especially once we add a subscription to the platform and like July, like our like, basically, like, we've scaled really, really quickly, but then our win loss against our competitors is extremely hard paper. We know if we're going up against any one of the other VC backed early stage AI interviewers, we're going to win, because we just have a much more comprehensive product. And so that's kind of where we're at right now. But then there's a lot of stuff that we're doing to go beyond this, with our platform being easily extensible. The data that we're collecting, like operates with an intelligence layer that people can build on top of to actually provide additional insights into workflows and power all sorts of kind of, like, interesting applications. But then we're also building, like, interesting ways to build automations within what they see as their workflow, by understanding how a recruiter operates and, like, automatically doing operations in that ATS right, for example, figuring out when to automatically put job posting out, versus, you know, the VOCA Milo, versus, you know, you name it. So that's kind of the direction we're going to really kind of augment what is very laborious in terms of that recruitment and then eventually onboarding the training and development. In my voting, not just ATF intelligence player, but the ATF intelligence player.

S Speaker 112:06Interesting, interesting. Sebastian, so maybe a couple of questions there on just the voice interviewing part. What kind of stack do you use, and have you say, Done? Do or maybe, does that stack influence the win rate to some degree as well, a certain extent.

S Speaker 113:31Got it and Subhash. So from from the bunch of agents that you have, and you have an orchestration layer to see what works, what not, do you need to fine tune it for different verticals, or is it more horizontal than that?

S Speaker 114:31got it, yeah, and then, and would love to sort of chat a little bit around the scoring side of things as well, like, how do you what's, what's the eval data that you would use for something like this? Is it comparing against the grading that a human would do that? And is that the best metric to tune the entire system towards? Or are you aiming for something like, something different than that?

S Speaker 214:56What we do, if you look at the job description and come up with like, a scoring system per question, like our recommendation of what a score of one out of five looks like versus four or five out of five, and then recruiter ultimately can have input on what that should be. They can modify that scoring of one out of five versus five out of five. That's how we ensure that every single candidate for each question is objectively evaluated for that question, right? So even though, like, our AI will ask appropriate follow up questions per candidate, it's ultimately scoring on the same kind of be fine scoring system. Essentially, that's how we kind of handle bias. And like our view of like, how to best kind of evaluate a candidate or a set of candidates

What we do, if you look at the job description and come up with like, a scoring system per question, like our recommendation of what a score of one out of five looks like versus four or five out of five, and then recruiter ultimately can have input on what that should be. They can modify that scoring of one out of five versus five out of five. That's how we ensure that every single candidate for each question is objectively evaluated for that question, right?

that scale that's super interesting. And then
S Speaker 115:40do you see say, how do you close the loop? Is the question again. Do you how are you able to say, demonstrate to an enterprise who has hay Milo as their long term contract saying that hiring through our pipeline is eventually, essentially more efficient than, say, doing traditional beyond the proper metrics, of just doing it at scale, doing it at a lower cost, being able to interview a lot more people. Like, are there any qualitative metrics as well that you can demonstrate what

S Speaker 216:15we also do because we're looking into more and more the HRIS is, is to understand retention period that folks that were relatively higher for us, or understanding performance, right? You know, if we think about it, because we're able to evaluate every single candidate at scale instantly, etc. You know, the best candidates should be moved forward, right? And but we are like looking into more of those, like layers beyond the pure ATF in terms of performance metrics and so on, to prove that these are the best candidates with a lot of our staffing agency who are customers, what we see about the past rate when they give these customers that are screened through, hey, Milo is like, 3x like, more likely to get through the hiring manager stage. You know, if the human recruiter to do it, like, manage into it, that's like a shorter feedback loop. Like the partner corporates we are, we have these ways to, like, measure it, like performance and so on, but also qualitatively. Like, for example, like, one of our customers is alpha six. Their entire new grad hiring is done through August of this year, and it's without it. Like, if you talk to them, without a doubt, they're getting way better quality, and it's coming in to them like job and like, they're able to do that pretty quickly, right? They're just able to assess not just like 5% of kids, but 100%

S Speaker 117:26of the candidates. Yeah, love how you're thinking about this. Sebastian makes, makes a lot of sense. Who owns the say, and then what kind of data are you collecting on each interview, and who would own the right to this data is it? Is it the company being interviewed? How are we thinking about it?

S Speaker 217:45It's typically the company, right, especially when they sign the data controller agreement, right? There are times, though, where we own the data customers who are more self serve. We own the data, so we can definitely retarget these customers, like candidates, to other companies over scale. But for corporates, I think in general, you know, it should be the company's data, right? And we can train within their company, instance and so on. But it is, I kind of understand where you're getting at with that question. It is interesting for us, and we do have some customers who let us know the data they don't really care to push that,

S Speaker 118:24yeah, yeah. I just, I just wanted to have this conversation, because I there's the sourcing side of things, like the people GPT is juice box, and a lot of companies coming on that front. I guess because you integrate into enterprises and their own ATS channels, you don't really need to take care of sourcing the right candidates, but the sourcing guys will eventually, seems like would enter into the market and say, two years, three years down the line, you would see a lot of consolidation in this market. Some folks go on to become platform companies. Some folks sort of die down, maybe, right? Yes, yes. Your, your views on this?
yeah, yeah. I just, I just wanted to have this conversation, because I there's the sourcing side of things, like the people GPT is juice box, and a lot of companies coming on that front.

S Speaker 219:03My view is like the person having, like people GBT, or juice block, which is built on people GBT, the FedEx like role that they focus on is, like more of that, like number one engineer in SS, or like POP account executive in New York. Our focus is, like, high volume hiring, right where, like a mass amount of inbound you're having to screen them, or you have to, like, for example, like Lululemon is opening up a factory. Like, over here you're a staffing agency. You need to hire like, 300 people in that Lululemon. And so, you know, it cost you, like, hundreds of 1000s of dollars to hire recruiters and do all the manual stuff you use game either to do that. So we're much more after, like, the high volume, one of, like, the third largest staffing agency in the world, for example, the customer of ours, but not a customer of people, GPT or juice box, yeah? Because more for like, they're not looking for the creme de la creme on, yeah.

S Speaker 220:18So we were near cash flow positive when we raise the round like, I generally believe in scaling highly efficiently. So if you continue to scale in the way that you plan to scale, I think that gives us, I don't know, like, many, many years, right? I think the way we do it, if you bring on three reps, you got to be profitable like they each of the rep has to be profitable within, like, potentially, and that's the amount of demand that we're getting, and, like, the amount of customer for amount of customer referrals and so on. The goal with this like rate, though, is to get to like, over five to 6 million Arr, within like, 12 months, right? So like that gives you kind of a scale of where we're at right now. But like, some of the largest fortune, one hundreds are adopting us right now. One of the largest RPOs is reselling us into the fortune 100 and then we partner with one of the biggest programmatic with also basically reselling or pushing us to their bank. So our like right now the biggest, the reason why we even raised around we could have just kept on scaling the way we were was to basically support that demand that we're about to get. And we again, believe in raising as little capital as possible and then just completely crushing it. For example, there are companies in the state that have raised like, $20 million and our ARR is higher than theirs in less time.
So we were near cash flow positive when we raise the round like, I generally believe in scaling highly efficiently.

So I would assume there's not another fundraising round, say, at least in the next 12 months or so, but it could come earlier, especially in this space, you could see a lot of growth pretty soon, and there are multiple new entrants. Like every time you scan a YC batch, there's something around recruiting. It's such a large market, for sure. Absolutely love how you're thinking about this Sebastian and the approach to make it a platform play makes a lot of sense. Let me do this by mid of January, I'll get back to you. Try to set up a discussion with our HR team and see if we can have that converted into a contract full transparency. We'll possibly do this, say, with a couple more companies, so there will be some sort of a bake off, but, but I love to do that, and at the same time keep me posted on how things go, if, in case, you're raising sometimes sooner, I'm sure the compute team internally, which would be very, very interested in having you as one of their software partners and taking You to a lot of enterprises, so we can explore that in parallel as well. I will that could be something we can touch base on, say, sometime in Feb but, but super interesting. Man. Thanks a lot for this discussion. Really enjoyed it.

So I think, you know, we're really excited to hopefully partner with you guys. Totally understand you guys will probably want to evaluate a few solutions. We're very confident when we do bake off against competitors.
