S Speaker 25:21right? Yeah, that makes sense. Got it. Got it. So
S Speaker 15:25yeah. New customers that they've never seen. Well, the longer the transition was a little bit higher.
yeah. New customers that they've never seen. Well, the longer the transition was a little bit higher.

yeah. New customers that they've never seen. Well, the longer the transition was a little bit higher.
S Speaker 25:34Fair enough. Got it. Got it. Yeah, yeah, that's fair. And one one last question on on the scale side, Fabio, the team mentioned that currently utilization of the DHT team is somewhere around 45%. And you would like to make it better for the cost to go down that makes a lot of sense. But on that front, do you see for that utilization to go to a higher number? Is there like a plan to go after a specific type of market specific kind of clients? Does that restrict your scale somehow? No,

S Speaker 28:09it. Got it. So in that case, is the plan to go acquire more grocery stores, but at the same time you would need to build that capacity to service the stadiums when it happens, right.

S Speaker 18:26Because they stay knows we have involved like we'd have a model for four hours of revision as well in other countries for eight hours and I would have put all those as well. So you can also do this that and this you always gonna have a little bit of availability will not want to get to the 100% Because someone may have a spike. Right? Okay. They may happen again, when we don't know what the game is like Audrey and someone this day you respect right? So you always you don't want to get to 100% to be 5%.

S Speaker 112:37Yeah, your annoying gasps sure. I'm sure it checks whether or not an interest in urine maybe if not. I will see you in Ruby.

S Speaker 212:52Okay, okay. Thanks for the great yeah, I understand. We cannot have the exact numbers a lot of it is assumptions, but just to get some understanding.

S Speaker 113:03People for our solution will just have like a responsible person, the usual black Sharpie. We have one person restocking five stores. But the person wrongs I've started the day in the morning. On five stores like this day you they pretty much have we still use a little bit different they stayed on the other day in the long run off let's not like assists guard and decrease the number of people because they have to respond. But they just do but just the ops people responding that star but this isn't the games that they have on the labor side. Got

S Speaker 213:50it. Got it. Yeah, that makes sense for Fabio and I think now we can just jump into the financial model. I have a few questions. And and maybe one very quick question from Carlos and go. One second limiter. He had a quick question for you.
it. Got it. Yeah, that makes sense for Fabio and I think now we can just jump into the financial model. I have a few questions. And and maybe one very quick question from Carlos and go. One second limiter. He had a quick question for you.

S Speaker 214:20Yeah, so Fabio, what's the current live stores that with stores and customers that we are in and how many stores are in deployment right now?
Yeah, so Fabio, what's the current live stores that with stores and customers that we are in and how many stores are in deployment right now?
Yeah, so Fabio, what's the current live stores that with stores and customers that we are in and how many stores are in deployment right now?
Yeah, so Fabio, what's the current live stores that with stores and customers that we are in and how many stores are in deployment right now?
S Speaker 114:32So rather than at stores like 11811 way and we have the flogging that may not get them remember? Remember jeans are too dumb everyday. They add stuff they're just good yeah.

S Speaker 215:23That's interesting. So like, do you have six to seven you said or 6767 67670? That's interesting. So like, by when do you think we'll be able to get these 67 stores live? So
That's interesting. So like, do you have six to seven you said or 6767 67670? That's interesting. So like, by when do you think we'll be able to get these 67 stores live? So

S Speaker 115:43it should be June 21. Soft to launch of the two o'clock Yeah, and the other one will be around between the end of this mass and then they are spread between the end of the mass so the next one is May 13. Two days from now. Okay, and the other will be the latest one will be in July. No. You're right is June 28. Perfect. is the last one is in one talk.

S Speaker 116:22So like in two months, they will all be open. Perfect. Perfect. That's great. So our next one is time. As soon as we get this start by clicking the call was a bit searches ready. But just as a part of the might the sign that contract with them that some of you may still need to do some contract some like some construction work, but when they say the certain ready partner guys are jumping between four to seven weeks for us.

S Speaker 216:52Right and that would mean installing the hardware setting up the software. We
Right and that would mean installing the hardware setting up the software. We
Right and that would mean installing the hardware setting up the software. We
Right and that would mean installing the hardware setting up the software. We
S Speaker 116:57don't stop now we hire people but we do the TPM we will charge for like the TPM but okay or so we do a little bit of GPS so far strong the camera, the hardware, everything and setting up the system and doing the calibration.
don't stop now we hire people but we do the TPM we will charge for like the TPM but okay or so we do a little bit of GPS so far strong the camera, the hardware, everything and setting up the system and doing the calibration.

S Speaker 117:18Yeah, well remember I don't like to remember like big apology. You mentioned. Now they can always calibrate the camera because of the doctor possesses parkour cameras. They need to partner with calibrated cameras using AI. Yeah. So now like we do that last part, like meeting two days. So maybe you'll see this in my class or for six weeks.
Yeah, well remember I don't like to remember like big apology. You mentioned. Now they can always calibrate the camera because of the doctor possesses parkour cameras.

S Speaker 217:45Yeah. Yep. Makes sense. Makes sense. But
S Speaker 218:18yes, yes. Give me a second let me put it
S Speaker 218:37Yep, so far beer My understanding is that revenue tracking revenue autumn enormous checkout and one time revenue are the three revenue sources one time revenue is broadly hardware from both the spatial and the autonomous revenue side, and

S Speaker 119:01it's true to deploy a star no matter terminals or whatever it is. The cost is that the revenue minus
it's true to deploy a star no matter terminals or whatever it is. The cost is that the revenue minus
it's true to deploy a star no matter terminals or whatever it is. The cost is that the revenue minus
it's true to deploy a star no matter terminals or whatever it is. The cost is that the revenue minus
S Speaker 219:11got it. And revenue tracking is actually the spatial AI. And this is the core business revenue automatic normal checking, okay, perfect. Machine learning is the cost side of things. And then pln p&l budget or what is everything? Got it? So a few questions here. Fabio, let me see. Yeah, let's let's go to revenue tracking. Let's start the Stoke on my new stores renewals total. Yep, is a word. Can you explain me a little bit about the growth numbers that you've used here? off point 5% month on month? Where is that coming from?

S Speaker 120:03This one actually is not brand new anything at the end of the day just forgot to delete it. We were dragging the grow for the transaction in the pass after central math. Yeah. But we know that at some point of mature transactions in November we started using but I forgot to delete it. Okay. There's not anything there. That I need to delete it.

S Speaker 120:30So they love the growth that is your number. Or trackies pretty much okay. We don't have any because all the machine you learn that we don't an autonomous checkout feeds the revenue tracking. So they're ready to track is pretty much our system running by itself in whatever it does. Yeah, so it's pretty much a number of scale the number of locations and we have the victim of modern coding that we are contracted with, discussing with Dollar General is the runway that they can grow. We have this dissembling line with two f&b providers in the runway that they gave both the ISS the new stars per month. And how much sort of like and why the anomaly detection is too much a stars that we have with us, because they're gonna start using is either the anomaly detection or the hot button or hot dog thing. And the safety is for the mic first and other other neutral isn't the food employee using hats or not.

S Speaker 221:47Got it? Got it. Sounds good. So yeah, fair idea of this tab. Okay, let's go to the revenue autonomics check out here. So Fabio, I think January the entire financial year 23 are actual numbers and from 24 The projection start. Yeah. Do you like I see all the new stores the numbers here actually hard coded? How How have you gone about that? How have you projected which stores is the projects
Got it? Got it. Sounds good. So yeah, fair idea of this tab. Okay, let's go to the revenue autonomics check out here.

S Speaker 122:24that the movers ropers is they have lined up in a contract with them we are doing an enterprise agreement with them yeah, they have like an a commitment for opening stores with us. Interest bombs the truth bomb Yeah. I'm actually glad to be here to speak just not very long anymore. Well could view as well is that commitment that if they need to be because of key view and contrast which is an enterprise agreement with them? So they can open multiple stores? Right? So they are a little bit ahead of time that this will be the worst case scenario. I will give you we have signing and then we're at 18 locations in Canada and 11 here in us. So that's just pretty much what we have been doing with them once every two months, and others as well. And then they're all this much new customers. When the word is our average, recording a new customer every month there's a new customer. If and if you'll see in the start here, they're
that the movers ropers is they have lined up in a contract with them we are doing an enterprise agreement with them yeah, they have like an a commitment for opening stores with us.
