S Speaker 10:00Company. This is just a small snapshot, but there have been several companies in the US that have gone from decent ARR traction over the last two to three years, these startups, most of these startups were started sooner, and they're all doing these, AI copilot, AI agent workflows, and I think everybody's familiar with cursor, Mercer is another one another. Peter Thiel, fellow college dropout. Many of them are college dropouts,

S Speaker 10:35Mercer is like a recruiting agent. And then they've gone from zero to 70 million ARR now over the last two years. Hagen is another one that is doing really good. It is generative video writer, actually, Qualcomm has a partnership with them. That was another one. Synthesia, we're familiar with them in Europe, 11 labs, also in Europe, they've gone grown pretty fast. Harvey AI and cartesia, are we? We actually had access in seed as well, and then cartesia is another one that where we had access and seed. But the problem was the check sizes for cartesia and even perceptron that I brought some of you might remember, in the end seed stage, they give us pretty small checks, even if and then after that Series A, B, they don't want to talk to us. They will talk to us in C, D rounds at much higher valuations, but they don't want to talk to us in a, b, because the mostly institutional get in and Sequoia go to lightspeed. They get in and they take all of those runs so and then

S Speaker 12:24so, so this, this is we've seen this many, many times and and really like similar traits of founders. Most of these founders are younger. They're going after this AI. They're not building their own models. Most, in most cases, they're not building growth models, building apps on top of existing models. These guys are all really fast and adapting themselves to the latest and greatest models. And then they get virality, one of the things that also the risk with many of them that they have a prosumer behavior, which is, they don't have a true enterprise sales motion, except a few. Maybe writer and Synthesia might have it as well, but most of them, actually, even writer and Synthesia, they started a very prosumer focused business. So they just go for a land grab, initially, with the number of users, but and then they start diversifying themselves in enterprise later. So there's a possibility, like, for example, Jasper was, was one company got 200 million Arr, pretty fast, and then it flattened out, and then other platforms took over. If, because, if you don't have a true moat.

S Speaker 13:46I talked about why we didn't get in, one of the things that we are exploring as an experiment now is is to see if we can when we have access. In some of these we've seen We've got access when we have access, we consider writing some smaller checks in seed checks, and two to three maximum per year. And then we'll evaluate in two years our performance, if it's not good, then we drop it if it's good, then even if one or two of these end up doing reasonably well, we'll continue to do I mean, we did bet on two, I would say, well, said lab and tab nine and earlier stages with similar traits, but, but they didn't, I mean, I wouldn't call them both, both of the company like, well said we invested when they were at 1.5 million error. They're close to 15 million error. Now I'm not classifying them as a breakout like some of the others, right? This is just a slide we put together. I don't know we there's a possibility we might have missed a few but, but really, the way it was, we were trying to look at across the AI stack, across the Gen AI stack, specifically, how many investments have we made, and where have we deployed? So if you take a look at it, we've a large part of our dollars have been deployed in the tooling layer and and then now, recently, we've started doing investing in vertical apps, which, in my opinion, is, I think that's where we should be considering to deploy more dollars for tooling startups. I think what happens is it's a better fit for BU, because bu always, we have gaps around tooling all the time. So tooling startups are great m&a candidates going forward. That's my thinking. And then then the vertical application startups would be great candidates for actually going and working these will be ecosystem partners for Qualcomm, but they'll have a good chance of a better financial ROI. So this company in particular, started mid last year, small team. And these guys are

S Speaker 16:13smart guys. I'll talk about them. What they're building is a AI based. It's a Microsoft Office Suite competitor with a first AI native like workflow so so they can generate documents, spreadsheets and and PowerPoints, that's the idea. And then they're working on this custom memory architecture that supports much larger context, and then that's still in research for them. But the bet, I'll talk about it. It's a very founder led bet, and they're also going after prosumer. So prosumer and enterprise both, but I think a large part of it initially could be personal and and then we've already started partnering with the NPC team there. They've raised already seven 9 million in safe. We are getting an allocation of 1.5 in that safe capped at 70 Lux, is the biggest check in that. So the this is mostly founder bet. So I've known this guy for the last two months now, and the young guy, very product obsessed, has built several products in the last two to three years. And these are all AI based products. There's several of his products that reached, you know, like one 80 million downloads in the app store, at number three ranking in the App Store. So, and these are all products that he was launching by himself, without even a team. And and now this is the first product where he wanted to be able to go build a larger company. So he, I mean, he takes I talk to him, I text him every day, and then I provide feedback, and I even alert him that report bugs on the product, takes feedback very seriously. He'll turn back around and within an hour and fix the bugs, and he's come across as a pretty smart guy, no ego, and then has intellectual honesty about the product, which was also important at this stage. I did talk to muhit Agarwal at Sequoia. So there's sequoias watching them for the next round. And then there's also, I spoke with two of his mentors at Stanford that was connected to me by one of the other investors in the round. And then both spoke very highly of Joe, right? Joe is the name of the CEO. So that's pretty much like why I want to lean in at the seed stage. Essentially, that's what I'm looking at. And at the same time, if this product can go viral, we started working with them and our aipc Guys, they're excited. They're already shipped on devices. They've already started coding models on edge. And then the idea is that, so here's where I think we will get Rami to actually present our team. I actually really like Ramis pitch to startups. So I've sat in two pitches where Rami has pitched to startups, so it's very upfront. And then also, what he proposes is, even if you use one running on the aipc, and then the rest of the stuff runs in the cloud, then we'll put our go to market engine behind it. So supposedly, we've got customers in in, in, you know, like McKinsey and a bunch of others that are asking for some of these models running on edge. And then Rami is saying that that we can take them to market with that. So they're very excited to work with context.

S Speaker 110:45they've got a bunch of different endpoints. They use a mixture of models, right? So they use open AI, deep research for some things. They use Cloud for some things, and they use Lama for some things, and then they use

S Speaker 111:06Now, what Rami and team typically pitch is so the team is saying, they're saying that if you want the best quality output today, you're only going to get it by running in the cloud for whether it's spreadsheets, whether it's document generation or PowerPoint generation, right now, what? And then the good news is, you know, Rami and team are very like they don't contest that part either, which is, they're not saying that. That's not true. However, in some environments, which is like defense and federal, what they're saying is that these companies, these customers, are okay with an inferior experience, but you have to have an air gap environment, and then the deployment could either be an aipc based deployment, or deployment could be an on prem compute as well. And over there, they're okay if you don't use the latest and greatest model from Open Air entropic and the others. They would rather have privacy security concerns addressed than not. And then the other one is in cases where where we can take them to customers is that they just swap out one endpoint for one small use case to running on the IPC. So in the near term, where PCs are still not as capable to run the largest and best models on edge, in the near term, you you only say that, okay, one endpoint out of the 10 endpoints that they're using runs on edge. And then they have a way to figure out they're running experiments right now, which endpoint will really work and and then, if they do that, then we'll take

12:54these ISV partners.
S Speaker 312:57So that's what they have. They have multiple endpoints to generate the output, and some of them could lend itself to the edge, but some could remain in the cloud.
So that's what they have. They have multiple endpoints to generate the output, and some of them could lend itself to the edge, but some could remain in the cloud.
So that's what they have. They have multiple endpoints to generate the output, and some of them could lend itself to the edge, but some could remain in the cloud.

Is important, yes, yes,
S Speaker 413:14shouldn't they have a specific, I mean, specific model. I mean, I remember with guide. I mean, it can be like running the huge models. They can run the smaller models of open AI and others, and maybe that can work out. But they even got silicon trip in your product. Why does it even spend time on that? I mean, instead of just going and, I mean, I would imagine maybe in a year for now, you can stop thinking about ads. But, you know, now, I mean,
shouldn't they have a specific, I mean, specific model. I mean, I remember with guide. I mean, it can be like running the huge models.

S Speaker 113:42no, I agree that's pretty much what it is. So the discussion is, was, which is we, we have suite of models that we've already optimized for PC. Now, among those suite of models, these guys will say, okay, which is the closest for one of the 10 end points for some small use case that's already running on aipc. And then they'll swap out that whenever aipc exists for that. And then for what's in it for the company in the short term is, is Qualcomm taking them to customers, if they do this, and it's not a big lift GTM, and then it's not a big lift for them. It's essentially one day worth of work. So which works out, and then Rami is happy with it. So Rami actually, I thought Rami did a pretty good job. It does a pretty good job of being very upfront with the companies
no, I agree that's pretty much what it is. So the discussion is, was, which is we, we have suite of models that we've already optimized for PC.

S Speaker 419:58I mean, I know it's a bit, it's hard and it's very competitive. I mean, it's, obviously, it's early stage and see, but you know, if you look at these companies, then, you know, at the end, I mean, some of them reach, not even done, right? I mean, maybe it's crap, but they reached, you know, $20 million so what is like, you know, the you know, what is going to drive people to use, in your opinion, to use context, you know, just leave these tools or what's going right? I mean, we have so many options, right? And I guess also, you know, obviously Microsoft, I mean, it's not going to be like, you know, steady state, right? So,
I mean, I know it's a bit, it's hard and it's very competitive.

20:36how do you see this?
S Speaker 120:38Yeah, good question. So what, one of the things that we've at least, I've noticed, is the cost of switching for many of these is low, so which is a risk for even context. So as soon as a new good tool comes about, people switch to that new good tool, because you don't really have a true enterprise sales here. So since a lot of this is prosumer, so even cursor for now, which is, you know, which is most of us probably familiar with cursor, cursor is
Yeah, good question. So what, one of the things that we've at least, I've noticed, is the cost of switching for many of these is low, so which is a risk for even context. So as soon as a new good tool comes about, people switch to that new good tool, because you don't really have a true enterprise sales here.

So since a lot of this is prosumer, so even cursor for now, which is, you know, which is most of us probably familiar with cursor, cursor is
S Speaker 121:16most of cursor is $30 per month per user. It's a very prosumer, even though they have many engineers using them and enterprises. But these are not enterprise contracts. They're just about now. They're going and working with enterprises on that motion. But up until now, it was primarily just and then cursor people switch really fast. So before cursor, if you think about it, there was GitHub, copilot, codium is another one. There's a there's like 10 other companies within that vertigo coding tools company that existed even before cursor, and then they migrated cursor, cursor, just because it was a better product. And then now cursor, over the last year has remained ahead of the competitors. So the game over here as to you have to remain ahead of the competitors, and then use that to build an enterprise sales motion before your prosumer users already jump off your platform. So that's a risk for all of these, not just like context. So context will also have to remain faster ahead of the competition. There's a risk. I mean,
most of cursor is $30 per month per user. It's a very prosumer, even though they have many engineers using them and enterprises. But these are not enterprise contracts. They're just about now. They're going and working with enterprises on that motion. But up until now, it was primarily just and then cursor people switch really fast.

22:29that's part of all of these. I think
that's part of all of these. I think
that's part of all of these. I think
that's part of all of these. I think
S Speaker 122:34the good news with the legal ones, like the Harvey ones, legal ones, you couldn't get it. It was enterprise sales to begin with. So the legal the cost of switching is higher for many
the good news with the legal ones, like the Harvey ones, legal ones, you couldn't get it. It was enterprise sales to begin with. So the legal the cost of switching is higher for many

legal AI contract. It's a bit
S Speaker 422:53of a different market. It's kind of more of an enterprise like sales from day one. Yes, so that's why Harvey got a high evaluation, in my opinion. Then context, if you look at then, Chris, if you look at the multiple, I
of a different market. It's kind of more of an enterprise like sales from day one. Yes, so that's why Harvey got a high evaluation, in my opinion. Then context, if you look at then, Chris, if you look at the multiple, I

S Speaker 123:09agree, yeah, definitely. Harvey is going, also going to all of these companies. They go for land grab. Harvey is going for a land grab. And let's
agree, yeah, definitely. Harvey is going, also going to all of these companies. They go for land grab. Harvey is going for a land grab. And let's
agree, yeah, definitely. Harvey is going, also going to all of these companies. They go for land grab. Harvey is going for a land grab. And let's
agree, yeah, definitely. Harvey is going, also going to all of these companies. They go for land grab. Harvey is going for a land grab. And let's
S Speaker 423:19go back to that this, this one. So mainly it's about right now, right? We think the team is really, like, you know, super capable. That that's the

S Speaker 123:52we've talked about the competition risks team also, if you think about it, it's a young team, so they don't really have a track record of recruiting. We haven't shipped enterprise products. He's shipped a few consumer products that have had good traction, but it's not nothing that has monetized in the past. And also, you know, there's no go to market sales experience. But I've talked to him, he's pretty set on how he wants to go go to market, because these guys are all the fellows. So they're taking inspirations from cursor and Mercer. They were all in the same class, supposedly, and so it's essentially very PRG. And then they want to launch a product really fast. They want to launch a product in April, even if it's a beta product. So however, everything else is a risk

S Speaker 624:52A quick question around the user persona. Who would the initial user persona be that they will target, especially in the plg motion. So initial persona, right? Superhuman, did a phenomenal job targeting certain kind of users, and then it expanded for where it'll be similar, I would imagine, right?

S Speaker 125:15Yeah, so one of the ICPs is, sort of is consultants, and so they're talking to companies like McKinsey, so one of the ICPs is consultants and consulting firms. It's something that they're building a product around initially. But again, with prosumers, I think if you take like they're also talking to many VC firms and PE firms for researching that's what they're targeting. And then the third one, they're going to go after product managers at software companies. So those are the three initially, but I think what's going to happen under one is within six months, this will be very different company,

S Speaker 626:06yeah. And do they tend to build workflows as well for certain user personas. What I mean by that is, like each of these personas will have certain kind of workflows which can potentially be automated, right? So
yeah. And do they tend to build workflows as well for certain user personas. What I mean by that is, like each of these personas will have certain kind of workflows which can potentially be automated, right? So

S Speaker 126:20that's the idea, which is, I would say, go to app.contest.com, and then as soon as you go there, it'll ask you, okay, what is your persona? What? What is it that you do just describe in natural language. And based on that, it will create, like, five, six workflows for you, automatically and and then. So the idea is to enhance those, and then, just for So, automate the creation of workflows based on personas.
that's the idea, which is, I would say, go to app.contest.com, and then as soon as you go there, it'll ask you, okay, what is your persona? What?

S Speaker 226:53Got it. And now, Tushar, if you can go back to the competition slide that you had, yeah. So I'm just trying to unpack maybe more more on the product side, what gives them an edge and how defensible that could be. From this chart, it seems like bringing context across slides, Docs and Sheets is something that is unique to context anybody else doing that, and what enables them to do that and how defensible that is, right? Like, for example, you know, if it's just creating a presentation, somebody else can also create it, right? But bringing in context from another document, another Excel sheet, there's a little value add there, right? What enables like, what is the technology breakthrough, or, you know, unique advantage that they've been able to solve
Got it. And now, Tushar, if you can go back to the competition slide that you had, yeah.

S Speaker 127:45so right now, they've built so Deepak the thing the problem is, I don't think this is defensible, because the problem is, these models keep getting better and bigger. They're able to ingest bigger and bigger context themselves, the smarts. So these guys, of course, they right now they can, they have smart ways to ingest much larger context than these models themselves. However, these model context windows, like Gemini, right now itself, is able to ingest 2 million tokens, which is few orders of magnitude compared to bigger compared to the other models. So then at that point, your moat around being able to ingest larger context goes away. The moat is more around how you orchestrate between all of these models to develop target, like the same problem, I would say, has perplexity. For example, perplexity. Let's take an example of perplexity, right? Perplexity is a search engine. Gemini is provided a search engine. OpenAI has provided a search engine. And I would imagine even anthropic will have a search engine using their own model in the near future. Perplexity still is able to grow really, really well. And it's more about, okay, how can I serve these models in the most efficient manner, such that the cost of serving these models is lower, and at the same time, I use Best of the Best of all these models, the context window. He I don't think that's a that's a true mode. The true mode for these is, how do I orchestrate these models to go target, build my own vertical use case? In this case, it's, it's, the key is being able to move context, which is, take context. So with these vertical apps, what happens is the differentiation is like when you're working with notion, for example, or when you're working with gamma, for example, what you do is you copy and paste from a document, but that, here's my context, you'll copy and paste from that document to gamma, and then it'll generate slides, and then while you're generating slides, you might actually have want to edit your original document as well. So what you do is you copy and paste back from gamma the slide deck, back to your doc, which could be a Word doc or Google. So So those contacts are not automatically managed in case of a suite. And then same thing with sheets, right? So you're making changes to the sheets, for example, and then you want those same changes to get reflected back to your PowerPoint slide or a document. The idea is that you have one stop shop where you can switch between slides, Docs, emails, like sheets.

S Speaker 230:39more from an output point of view, right? I think, what to your point about orchestration? You feel there's a strong motive in terms of orchestrating context.

S Speaker 130:48I wouldn't use the word mode for actually any of these. I don't think any of these have a moat. And to actually, to that point, even open AI and philanthropic and all of these companies don't have a mount. Their mode is capital. The mode for these companies is velocity, product velocity. The mode for these companies is primarily at this point just Yeah, vertical, AI companies would be the same at this point, like the more for these could have been the model, but the model is commoditized now, so now you have to go build vertical apps.

S Speaker 231:29Yeah, I was thinking more from a user experience or understanding elect cursor, does that really well, right? One of the reasons developers love it is because it's very developer friendly in terms of the flow, and you know how easy it is to use. So maybe they do. They have somebody guiding them how consultants build presentations and stuff like that, yeah.

S Speaker 131:49So they have a bunch of McKinsey guys that are working with them today, okay, for presentations. And so that's the learning from the customer. But that's not like once you launch the product, you have a better handle. Yeah, curses moat is actually UX. They understood you, but that's not like as we know. We don't consider that as a strong so, but curses moat is truly they understood developer behavior really, really well, and and then the fact that they were able to migrate from GitHub Copilot to them, it was primarily because they understood the developer behavior was tab fixed, and then now, slowly they've graduated to they didn't go after like how Devin did. So those are smaller nuances, but then that these guys, of course, talk about, he talks about that in length, and learning from how cursor built it, I think it's hard to predict we'll go and when the product actually launches.

S Speaker 432:53of the question I have is regarding the board, which understands, I mean, it's young company with young people. And you know the fact we don't have a voice? I mean, no one has a boat seat or whatever. That's a weird strategy to me, at least in our I mean, even lacks, right? You can argue about us, which is important observer, but no board seat.

S Speaker 133:19have so buzz. I talked to him, of course, and he said cursor didn't have it. Devin didn't have it. Merkha didn't have it. It was more about product velocity. They're saying that we don't want to, I mean, we'll do it at series A we don't want to do it at the seat. So it's they're saying that we we've disconsolted with others in the space. They've all been like that.

So we that's their argument.
S Speaker 433:53Yeah. I mean, I understand their argument. I don't think it's a good argument for us to be honest with you, obviously. I mean, number one, you cannot learn a lot because you're basically just, you know, you know, there is no board meetings, right? So you cannot really get an update, see the curve. And number two, if something happens, you cannot do anything, right? I mean, just hope, maybe, legally, we have something to do, but, you know, but maybe, again, maybe you can argue. I mean, I mean, I'm surprised that slacks doesn't even get to sit, but I understand that the value right now, kind of scheme, but

S Speaker 138:24I talked to him about it, he said, right now, they don't want to go down that path of introducing customers to investors. I know it's hard, but essentially, it's similar Albert in many others that we've done, we've looked at in the past. It's in that seed stage. It's I've asked him, of course, I've asked him to talk to McKinsey and Docs, what he could get access to his box. Go ahead, sorry, he could get me access to box. I'm pushing on it so.

S Speaker 139:19right now, go as he wants to go run launch GA, and then he wants to close the round, which is essentially saying, if you want to do this, then do this. But he's essentially saying the round is already oversubscribed. I want to go focus on just GA, because then he's saying that investors will have other questions. You're not going to get.

S Speaker 139:58His interest to get us in right now. So he sees the benefit of go to market. He sees that there could be when they go GA so, because, so here's what Rami told him. Rami said that we want you to launch in April, which, because it seems we have some launch in April as well. And then he wants to go launch a bunch of ISV partners. And then a lot of them are actually us, Bria guide, Cresta, so and so, that's in April. So it aligns really well with his launch. So he thought that this enterprise launch with a Qualcomm brand, with with him being GA, could be a good go to market launch. That's, that's why things Welcome

S Speaker 440:47to me promoting when in April is not going to have anything related to, I mean, I see Bria guide, I guess question, they're all doing a lot of work. I mean, there is now a weekly meetings with Bria and guide. I mean, integration, it's a process, right? Walk in the park, right? These guys don't just launch his first cloud, cloud product on April.

S Speaker 141:32Not yet. This is, man, we they haven't launched yet. This is just word of mouth, like I'm telling you, go to app dot, context learning they haven't launched it. It's like, if you go to the website, they'll say, click on the wait list.

S Speaker 941:47Yes, I realized that. I know they have a launch. I'm just curious about the total people, like number people on the waiting list, or the users. So it's by invitation. Users are

S Speaker 642:05see, I see a quick one. I know we tried to hedge considering risk associated with a seed, you know, check putting in 1.5 million. But my observation has been, you know, when you have a 2.1% stake in an early stage company. When they hit it off the park, if they hit it off the park, the kind of dilution that you have sort of makes the outcome, you know, they exit very poor. So I'm just wondering, is there an opportunity to grab more stake, considering the, you know, the fact that it's a seed investment, I know we are hedging with a smaller check, but I'm just wondering if that's something that you think makes sense, because if the header of the park, the amount of capital they'll raise, will dilute us significantly, and our pro data, we may not be even, we may not even be able to play that PRO data, I would imagine

S Speaker 643:47So what I was getting at Tushar, if there's an opportunity based upon performance milestones, for us to invest a certain amount at a fixed valuation before the series A I was trying to get to that, that was the structure. Is there an option structure at all?

S Speaker 144:04I will try. But guys, this is the game, ball game here is different. This is, this is what I'm trying to propose, is seed stage investment in some of these fast growing AI companies. We don't have power for negotiation. Trust me, I've gone through many of these in the past, and then, essentially the answer we get, the more we ask, the answer we get is no. So we

S Speaker 444:29are going to have, we are going to have the same case with solving didn't go kind of heads up so, you know, hopefully Queen could see the recording. That's going to be the same we have way over subscription. The founder wants to run very fast. If you want to take if you want to invest, go ahead. If you don't want, I have 10 other customers going to take your portion. I think that's what we've seen in this company in UK, which they already in revenue. So Michelle will speak about it next week. And then that's the case here, and I guess one, but I do want to know again, that's a comment, if that's the case right now proceed stage. We need to apply it also to other other investments. Yeah,
are going to have, we are going to have the same case with solving didn't go kind of heads up so, you know, hopefully Queen could see the recording. That's going to be the same we have way over subscription. The founder wants to run very fast. If you want to take if you want to invest, go ahead. If you don't want, I have 10 other customers going to take your portion. I think that's what we've seen in this company in UK, which they already in revenue. So Michelle will speak about it next week. And then that's the case here, and I guess one, but I do want to know again, that's a comment, if that's the case right now proceed stage. We need to apply it also to other other investments. Yeah,

S Speaker 145:11I agree, guys. So we met, met him. Quinn has met him. The bet is primarily the founder is pretty good, smart. He runs really, really fast. We've seen some of these that have similar traits, that run really, really fast. It's a bet on the founder and the team at a seed stage. It's we can analyze a lot at this stage. The truth is, in six months to eight months from now, this will be a very different company from what I'm presenting today. So

S Speaker 145:53we cannot know, but what I'm trying to say is there's a good chance that this will be a different company, and then the ICP will be different. The GTM will be different, you know. And there's a chance that there's a good there's a bigger chance this company actually doesn't work up for all these reasons that were mentioned. It's a seed stage bet. We're just trying with some founders, based on some of the other prior companies that we've looked at, 20 odd companies in the past that have had similar founders. See each stage. I'll send you a lux memo.

S Speaker 147:01So the question is that, how much is is this a product led, which is how good the product is, versus is this just a founder LED? Founder LED? Yeah, so in my mind, Albert, it's more founder than product today, then and the product today. I've used it. I found, I found it to be useful. The problem is I, since we cannot upload proprietary data, so for my day to day right now, I cannot necessarily use it, because we can't upload. The key would be when you upload data. So I've uploaded a bunch of data from like reports that you can download publicly, then it works really well. So the product could have strong merits. I can, I think once we are able to use it in an enterprise setting, I can find it to be very, very useful. So there's this. Some part of it is obviously product, but a large part of it is team.

S Speaker 148:15so I'll show this. It's, you know, we had to do this. But at this point, this is all us, the company is not company's projections. This is just us projecting a land grab scenario. So in case of a land grab scenario, then this is how I could play out. In fact, in case of a land grab scenario, this could be even sooner these numbers, but this is just us projecting this at this stage, their current like they're projecting, with the current cash, the runway to around, to be around three years. But obviously, as we know, if the GA truly launch becomes successful, then they get a much larger investment soon enough.
so I'll show this. It's, you know, we had to do this. But at this point, this is all us, the company is not company's projections. This is just us projecting a land grab scenario.

S Speaker 149:08And this is, again, I think it's too early to project, but of course, based on we think that if they can get to 80 million ARR in five years, then then we could have a decent return on investment. So
And this is, again, I think it's too early to project, but of course, based on we think that if they can get to 80 million ARR in five years, then then we could have a decent return on investment. So

S Speaker 249:24two structures for the exit are we project the IPO or MNA, or what's timing of it?
two structures for the exit are we project the IPO or MNA, or what's timing of it?
two structures for the exit are we project the IPO or MNA, or what's timing of it?
two structures for the exit are we project the IPO or MNA, or what's timing of it?
S Speaker 149:32This would be, it's hard. We like if they get to 80, and then if you project and exit at this point, this will be m&a Like, this is not, this is not IPO, but it's hard to say. I mean, it's possible that just within the next year or two, if you guys start getting pretty good traction, Microsoft could come in, or Google could come in and buy them
This would be, it's hard. We like if they get to 80, and then if you project and exit at this point, this will be m&a Like, this is not, this is not IPO, but it's hard to say.

50:04and and the valuations
and and the valuations
and and the valuations
and and the valuations
S Speaker 150:08are hard to predict. In that case, they've played billions of dollars per exit as well. My guess is, since there's a young founder first company, there's a possibility, if somebody comes in with a two, $300 million M A they could sell for that price as well. So it's
are hard to predict. In that case, they've played billions of dollars per exit as well. My guess is, since there's a young founder first company, there's a possibility, if somebody comes in with a two, $300 million M A they could sell for that price as well. So it's

50:27several ways this could play out.
several ways this could play out.
several ways this could play out.
several ways this could play out.
S Speaker 150:31We're really betting that the idea is not bet for like, two, $300 million I'm considering to bet make a few of these bets, if any one of these truly break out like the cursors of the world, then we can have an outsized outcome otherwise. Right now, with these AI companies, like the many that pooling companies invest in I don't think we can have an outsized outcome there.

S Speaker 451:04Okay, I just hope this is going to be applied for, you know,
Okay, I just hope this is going to be applied for, you know,

51:11agenda is different.
S Speaker 451:15It's not different. I agree with you. I just hope it's going to be applied to, you know, to other regions, and that's the way we're going to think about it. So
It's not different. I agree with you. I just hope it's going to be applied to, you know, to other regions, and that's the way we're going to think about it. So

It's not different. I agree with you. I just hope it's going to be applied to, you know, to other regions, and that's the way we're going to think about it. So
S Speaker 151:32one thing to think about is the characteristics for most of these startups are really within a 10 mile radius of where we are here. So so we have to prove that it's the same characteristics. I'm not I get it. I think we typically don't do this. I'm not proposing this to make my life harder because we this is going against what we typically do. I'm only proposing this because we saw this over the last two to three years, and then in many cases, we've been able to get access. It's it's just that the check sizes are smaller, and then their seed stage, they're all similar behavior and seed stage. And then can we get an outsized outcome over the next if we try this experiment for this region. The reason why this region, because this is very specific to just Bay Area companies, unless we can prove this is this cat like, unless we have, like, a 20 company roster of other regions as well that have done this, I think the case is harder.
one thing to think about is the characteristics for most of these startups are really within a 10 mile radius of where we are here. So so we have to prove that it's the same characteristics.

S Speaker 452:40Yeah, no, I think it's again, it depends, I think. But you know, it's fine. I mean, again, I think it's, it's a global phenomenon. We see it not only in AI. We sit also with cyber companies. That's going to happen now. I think his philosophy is important this early stage. I agree with you about the access, and I'm fine. I'm supportive. I'm just saying it's, it's a bit different the playbook, and again, I don't think we're going to do,
Yeah, no, I think it's again, it depends, I think. But you know, it's fine. I mean, again, I think it's, it's a global phenomenon. We see it not only in AI. We sit also with cyber companies.

S Speaker 153:11you know, the play. The question is, is there similar phenomena, as I've mentioned in the first slide, of having so many companies just scale from zero to 100 million error in a span of one to two years. This thesis is predicated, like the hypothesis of this is based on on that you know, that we're observing this is happening. So this is true revenues, not just valuations so and if that's the case, then, if you don't do this, then we're going to miss out, and then we're going to,
you know, the play.

S Speaker 553:56the one question I have as far as kind of you know, where this company goes is, I know you mentioned a couple of potential m&a candidates, but a lot of the m&a, you know, targets would potentially be value destructive, unless I'm understanding the product wrong, right? If they go to Microsoft, they'd want to use it for kind of their suite, similar with Google, but this is more horizontal. It's that's a little different than other vertical platforms like Harvey, where there's, you know, it's fairly siloed, so there's value destruction and acquisition. So are we really shooting kind of for the moon here? Otherwise, you know, this is the m&a universe. Might not be as broad as it is, right? And then similarly, with, you know, when we looked at guys like, rewind right, when there's no real tech mode, and someone comes out Microsoft Office right with copilot, kind of swallowed up a lot of what they were doing, just because the big incumbents, while they were slow, they still kind of got there eventually. So does it erode their overall position? Those are, I think, the two main questions I had in this, I think the overall product is incredible, right? If they can kind of deliver it, but it's just that those two pieces are a little fuzzy for me.

the one question I have as far as kind of you know, where this company goes is, I know you mentioned a couple of potential m&a candidates, but a lot of the m&a, you know, targets would potentially be value destructive, unless I'm understanding the product wrong, right? If they go to Microsoft, they'd want to use it for kind of their suite, similar with Google, but this is more horizontal. It's that's a little different than other vertical platforms like Harvey, where there's, you know, it's fairly siloed, so there's value destruction and acquisition. So are we really shooting kind of for the moon here? Otherwise, you know, this is the m&a universe. Might not be as broad as it is, right? And then similarly, with, you know, when we looked at guys like, rewind right, when there's no real tech mode, and someone comes out Microsoft Office right with copilot, kind of swallowed up a lot of what they were doing, just because the big incumbents, while they were slow, they still kind of got there eventually. So does it erode their overall position? Those are, I think, the two main questions I had in this, I think the overall product is incredible, right? If they can kind of deliver it, but it's just that those two pieces are a little fuzzy for me.
S Speaker 155:10Yeah. So the way I thought about that Rich is like, in fact, for horizontal plays, these larger companies would be more interested in the horizontal plays than the vertical plays, because they have horizontal products, because they have PowerPoint and slide and excels and Docs, and then, because they want interoperability between these documents and context to be carried over between These documents, which doesn't happen today for each one of these products, if you take a look at and and that's the gap that these guys address for these horizontal players. So I thought that, in fact, for for an m&a candidate, for these larger companies, at least the horizontal products might might be a better fit.
Yeah.

S Speaker 156:07Yeah, the vertical ones will be a better fit for something, something like a sales force. So there's so many sales AI companies these days, LLM companies, Salesforce, I think is a very good fit from an m&a standpoint for those,

S Speaker 656:24shot a quick one before we wrap. What about these agent frameworks like crew AI? I mean, still, I mean, they probably are more of a builder right now, Agent builder. Are these companies also gaining that kind of traction? Or are you seeing only actual applications that are verticalized, or horizontal application that complete workflows gaining traction.

S Speaker 156:52and crew. AI, from a developer community standpoint, it has the strongest developer community for AI agents, my view on these crew AI is land chains of the world, is that they will have a much harder time because they're not building what they're targeting their persona. Target persona as a developer, now that it's a and that developer has to go build a product and go sell it to a customer or a developer within the company, like Salesforce would be like a sales agent and whatnot, right? So I think that's a much harder sale, and especially these sales, then you're they don't have predictability, and
