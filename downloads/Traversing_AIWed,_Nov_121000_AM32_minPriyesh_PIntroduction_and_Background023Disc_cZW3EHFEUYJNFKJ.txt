S Speaker 11:40i Hi, Priyesh, how are you? Hey, hi, Blair. I'm doing good. How are you? Great. Thank you. It's nice to meet you. Absolutely pleasure meeting you. Where are you? Calling in from today, I'm in Las Vegas. How about you? Okay, the Qualcomm ventures team, most of us are here, based in Peninsula, yes, yes. And then some members are in San Diego, where our headquarters is, but most of the investment members, are you? Very nice. So I'm assuming Vegas would be a very, very big target market for you. Are you are you there for work, or do you operate out of

S Speaker 25:01No, I think that you hit them all. How well you invest $150 million a year? How are you still looking to make investments this year? Really more looking to make investments starting into 2026,

S Speaker 15:17oh, no, we are actively deploying capital. So our years, like Qualcomm's financial year, ended in September, so we are already in 2026 but other than that, that's not really, yeah, and that's not really a concern for us. It's an evergreen fund. We don't have to return capital. So mandates are pretty clear on that. Great.

S Speaker 25:38And then when you talk about what you you said Cresta was the AI contact center that you have already invested in. Yes, do you see that being a conflict at all? Because that's similar to what we do with our AI contact center, but we are exclusively in the hospitality space where I don't believe that that's where they are at all conflict.

S Speaker 15:58I don't see that as a conflict. Rest is quite late, and they're moving more into sales automation and support automation. So they're expanding into those spaces. They haven't chosen any say verticals as the target market, and then they directly sell to BPOS. So it would be a completely different space, I would say, excellent.

S Speaker 26:46all right, so I started working the hotel business when I was 15 years old. I'm from I'm from Alabama, and I started working as an intern. And I did it all right, from cleaning rooms all the way to running sales and marketing at the largest hotel in the US here at the Venetian which is what brought me out to Las Vegas. Right running these mega resorts was my dream, specifically in the sales and marketing aspect, and that's what I was able to accomplish. But here's what I learned in my years of running the running hotels in the in the city, with every resource that we have access to. Hotel technology is absolutely awful. I've lived it, I fought with it, and every hotel has lost revenue because of it, and that's why we started traversing AI, and it was just to fix this problem. So to take a step back and to really address this, most hotels are stuck on ancient local servers, software that was built decades ago, and can't even connect to modern APIs. But because of that, hotels have zero visibility into their own data. They lose out on bookings to third party middlemen, and that cost them hundreds of 1000s of dollars, or in the case of my old companies, millions of dollars every single year. They're bleeding, and they're stuck with this expensive, clunky software that doesn't solve their core problem. So our goal is simple. We're going to bring hotel technology into the modern era without forcing them to rip and replace everything that they already have. We connect all those legacy systems to modern API's, unlocking direct bookings, more revenue and actionable data, all without a painful and expensive rollout. And first we're going to own Las Vegas. It's the epicenter of hospitality, and then the rest of the world. So as we think about results, we're going to talk about the Rio after implementing in the first 90 days with the Rio in Las Vegas, abandonment rate reduced to zero while handling over 3000 daily calls, more than 80% of those calls are resolved without the involvement of a human, while still generating an increase in both direct bookings and an ancillary sales revenue.

S Speaker 19:11And most of these calls, Blair, are these more booking calls? Are these more support calls? And what do you mean by resolution?
And most of these calls, Blair, are these more booking calls? Are these more support calls? And what do you mean by resolution?
And most of these calls, Blair, are these more booking calls? Are these more support calls? And what do you mean by resolution?
And most of these calls, Blair, are these more booking calls? Are these more support calls? And what do you mean by resolution?
S Speaker 29:20Yeah, it's a good mixture of both. So it's that's why we wanted to take a good, good mixture, or it's why we wanted to aggregate all of them. So we started out. We started out with the intention of only doing the inbound calls, which was FAQs, so there were no reservation calls and no revenue associated with those for that first week. But because we were seeing such massive success, and we were handling over a 40% resolution rate without the involvement of a human, they said, Turn on these other pieces, and we were able to go forward with it without the or with the integrations that we already had access to. And that's where we started to see the spike with the AI resolution rate and the revenue generation. So we see a good mixture of both types of calls, internal versus external calls. For I've got a ticket. I need you to I need housekeeping in my room. I have a clogged toilet. I've got a question about a box office, vice versa. But then I also have calls about, I want to make a reservation I have, I'm a casino player, and I want to redeem my free play, and I want to redeem my free room, vice versa, right? So we can handle all of those types of calls. Those are the pieces that were that we're talking about. But then it's also I want to, I want to check in early. I want to, I want to stay later. Those are the ANS, revenue pieces that we're also able to capture.

S Speaker 110:49Got it and Blair, this is jumping a little bit up ahead, but how does the tech stack look behind? Say, your voice answering system. How have you built it? I assume you're capturing a lot of data points that hotels may have access to. You mentioned connecting to their legacy systems. Can you give me an say breakdown of how the tech stack looks like?

S Speaker 113:23Got it and couple of questions. Blair, you're just trying to understand this better. So on the left side of the diagram, you expose traversing AI, say, as a voice AI call system, as also a communication system. How do you work with, say, the likes of third party experience? Where do you integrate with them? And what's the value proposition there?

S Speaker 213:46Yeah, so we already have an existing connectivity or API with Expedia to provide availability, rates and inventory into Expedia on behalf of the hotel. So that is what the value proposition is we're just another channel on Expedia where they opt into the Expedia has access to that property's availability, rates and inventory.

S Speaker 114:10Got it. And for some hospitals, sorry, for some hotels which do not use traversing they I would assume they already have, say, a connection there, through an API or traditional, how does, what's, what's the additional value that you are adding to this transaction?

S Speaker 214:25So the from Expedia is perspective. Expedia doesn't care, and we'll use Expedia is one to many. Yes, CEDIA booking.com, any of the OJS or the third parties, they don't care how they're connected. They care that they're connected, right? So the third party wants to be connected to the hotel. The hotel needs to be connected. The problem that the hotel sees is that, going back to that second slide, right? Their hotel here has so many different layers of systems, and this is where they're bleeding right now, because they have all of these disconnected systems in place that they're managing, that they they're they're losing out on revenue. They're paying out commissions, they're paying out software fees. This is where we simplify that software stack to them. And so instead of paying a channel manager, instead of paying a CRS, now they can simplify just those two systems into one software stack on top of having to pay or simplify a payment gateway, third party payment processor and everything else into one simple

S Speaker 115:32solution. Got it. Got it. And one question on the say right side of the diagram, Claire, I'm not as familiar on the say, software suites that hotels use today. How many integrations, roughly, do you see across all of these systems that you mentioned here is a different software stacks for different hospitals. Is integration really a problem in this industry?

solution. Got it. Got it. And one question on the say right side of the diagram, Claire, I'm not as familiar on the say, software suites that hotels use today. How many integrations, roughly, do you see across all of these systems that you mentioned here is a different software stacks for different hospitals. Is integration really a problem in this industry?
S Speaker 215:56Oh, it is such a problem in this industry just to sell a room. This is just to go to market. The average hotel has 10 different systems just to sell a room on top of their property management system. So with traversing AI, what we can do is simplify that software stack from an average of 10 systems into a single one, and that doesn't even encompass our AI contact center. So that's an extra five systems. And then you add in the casino management software another five systems, right? So as we start to go in and build trust with something as simple as let us answer your phone, and we can do that automatically. Take over 40% of your calls and as quick as three days, we start to embed ourselves and say, Oh, you don't have reservations and taken over. Well, we can take that over and oh, we already have access to your rates and availability, whether it's through your third parties, whether it's through our existing channel managers. And then we've already built in an established trust. That's a first system done and easy, easy to do. Then we start to go in and say, Oh, you're using hot sauce as your system for housekeeping and facilities management. We already have an integration there. We'll just knock that one off. Use it, but we're becoming a web, right? A web of systems and integrations that already exist for us. It costs us no more money, but it simplifies the stack for the hotel, where we then start to come and go in and start to build and evoke that even more trust with the hotel, and we can remove other layers of complexity there and then build into an even larger system and capability stack for that.

S Speaker 217:44no, not at all. I hadn't even gotten to the most exciting piece. The last thing that was going to tell you on this one was that every year, the Rio is spending more than $6 million for their contact center, and but because of us, they reduced their cost by 90% so I mean, that was my last piece on this one. So on top of all the things that we're doing for the hotel, that they're that they're saving, they're saving a massive amount of funding just because of what our capabilities were. And that doesn't even touch on all the system reductions that we've been able to so when we talk about the growth and what else we're focused on. To date, we've already achieved over two and a half million in ARR we've signed other contracts so far, and we have over $7 million in our total, in our overall pipeline and evaluate an ACV. So we are getting ready to close before the end of this month, another three hotels. We have another two that should close by the end of this year, that are all based in Las Vegas, and then we have another 100 million in our pipeline overall. So we've proven, and I'm sorry this is meant to slide I forgot to click, we've proven that when hotels adopt traversing AI, they don't just say they scale, and that demand for growth has really never been higher. So the three properties that will close before the end of this month that those that circa downtown in Las Vegas, the D and the Golden Gate Hotel, the properties before the end of this year that are incentivized to close before the end of this year is the Sahara, previously the SLS and then also the Grand Sierra Resort and in Reno. So that opens up another market for us that also is a gaming hotel, and then brings it up. And then we also have Caesars Entertainment that will be closing and piloting the flamingo here in Las Vegas as well. And then that will be a pilot hotel that will start in q1 that will open up their rest of their 10 hotels here in Las Vegas.

S Speaker 119:46Very, very interesting. Blair, congrats on all the success this. This looks like a lot of big players, and certainly a lot of expansion potential as well. But you mentioned ACV, roughly. What's the ACV per hotel,

Very, very interesting. Blair, congrats on all the success this. This looks like a lot of big players, and certainly a lot of expansion potential as well. But you mentioned ACV, roughly. What's the ACV per hotel,
S Speaker 220:00yeah, so depending on which product they're starting with, because we do have so many components of what we're working on, we're looking at roughly anywhere between, anywhere between 50,000 and MRR to, sorry, 50,000 in MRR, to about 20, about 200,000 and MRR depending on the hotel. So that's what the range can be, and where that gets us to 7 million in an ACV depending, obviously, on the hotel, because each hotel has a different size. Obviously seizures. Entertainment changes at scale, and that's the larger one of the of the group. But we also have Venetian in the pipeline. They, they were meant to close before the end of this year. We're, we're moving them into q1 now at the because they've delayed their project. But we are, but we are confident that that that one moment as well.

S Speaker 121:01Got it and Blair, Quick, Quick clarification. So say, if you say 50k in MRR, that's roughly about 600k in annual contracts, right? And that's per hotel. And on the higher side, you mentioned 200k which would be two and a half million, or slightly lower than that. So for that per hotel and current ARR is, if, if you say that's two and a half, how, how many customers do you have? Like, how is it? How is the math working there? Yeah,
Got it and Blair, Quick, Quick clarification. So say, if you say 50k in MRR, that's roughly about 600k in annual contracts, right? And that's per hotel.

S Speaker 221:33so we have again, so we have smaller hotels today, the Rio obviously being our larger one, we have about 12 hotels in total that are using our services today. That's how we got to the two and a half million today, in Ace, in in ARR and then for the ones that we have in our pipeline that are expected to close the 7 million is accumulation between the circa, the D the Golden Gate, then the the Sahara, the grand, Grand Sierra Resort. And then we have the other ones that we know are getting ready to close as

S Speaker 222:19It works out perfectly. I'll hit that this is just a good competition, competition slide. And like I said, because we are much more in the hospitality space, this is why it's very focused on this. We are the only players embedding AI directly into hotel operations. So this ensures hotels own their bookings, their data and those guest relationships, which is really what's allowed us to win that business. So then we talk about the team. This is what our team looks like today. On the background is really who our team is. It's a very small team. So we're a team of seven today. We have some great advisors. Overall. That's who you're seeing the big bold pictures here, but our but our team is very small, we started officially. So if you see Kyle on the far left hand side, Kyle started a company called sweetness. That's how he and I met Kyle. Sweetness was a B to C platform that started out with the emphasis on selling high end suites and guaranteed connecting rooms. I'm going to start sharing, because this is the end of the slideshow. So the emphasis of selling high end suites and guaranteed connecting rooms. So when I was on the hotel side, Kyle was my customer, and Kyle would always solve my niche problems that I would have. Kyle and I met when he was selling the suites over at Caesars, when I was working there, my niche problem at the time was I was working for Caesars at their corporate office, and I had all these different suites across the board between Caesars Palace and imperial palace at the time and everything in between, and I didn't have a way of selling them. And Kyle says, Well, I can build you a white label website, and I can sell them. So between Caesars and Haras and Flamingo and Planet Hollywood, he built this website, and it worked so well that our casino team got mad at us because we sold so many cash selling suites that they didn't have any more for their comp selling customers. So I had to turn it off, but it worked so well that went by the time I moved over to the Venetian and was running their sales and marketing department, I had a different problem where I needed to sell. I had 7000 connected rooms, and I didn't have a way technologically to sell them, but Kyle figured it out. And so Kyle said, Well, I can do this for you. Great. And he did, and he still, to the this day, was the only customer that was able to sell and fundamentally be able to launch this, this product. So ultimately, Kyle's always been my go to person to make very complex what seems like very complex problems, from a hotel perspective, easy and actionable. And so from my what, from Kyle's perspective, Kyle would say, Blair's got great ideas, and I can sell these ideas to other hoteliers. I had no idea that he was doing this. Fast forward to the pandemic. Kyle was able to take the Kyle was able, unfortunately, had to take the company down as low as possible to say, we're we've survived, but took the company as low as possible, got into survival mode and asked me to join him. In 2022 I then joined him and said, let's figure out what we can make this company. So in January 2023 we went to his existing board and said, we're going to basically restart the company as traversing AI. It was traverse software, but traversing AI and take it as a B to C Company. So we wanted to keep and maintain all the IP of sweetness, but keep all the contracts and keep everything that we own, and that's why all those integrations exist. It's the legacy business, but we sweetness still represents 1% on the cap table. It was led by Bullpen Capital on our original investor, and we were able to raise money as a seed round with water tower ventures, one of our our new on our new cap table, and that's where we've been for the last for the last two years,
It works out perfectly. I'll hit that this is just a good competition, competition slide. And like I said, because we are much more in the hospitality space, this is why it's very focused on this.

I'm going to start sharing, because this is the end of the slideshow. So the emphasis of selling high end suites and guaranteed connecting rooms. So when I was on the hotel side, Kyle was my customer, and Kyle would always solve my niche problems that I would have. Kyle and I met when he was selling the suites over at Caesars, when I was working there, my niche problem at the time was I was working for Caesars at their corporate office, and I had all these different suites across the board between Caesars Palace and imperial palace at the time and everything in between, and I didn't have a way of selling them. And Kyle says, Well, I can build you a white label website, and I can sell them. So between Caesars and Haras and Flamingo and Planet Hollywood, he built this website, and it worked so well that our casino team got mad at us because we sold so many cash selling suites that they didn't have any more for their comp selling customers. So I had to turn it off, but it worked so well that went by the time I moved over to the Venetian and was running their sales and marketing department, I had a different problem where I needed to sell. I had 7000 connected rooms, and I didn't have a way technologically to sell them, but Kyle figured it out. And so Kyle said, Well, I can do this for you. Great. And he did, and he still, to the this day, was the only customer that was able to sell and fundamentally be able to launch this, this product. So ultimately, Kyle's always been my go to person to make very complex what seems like very complex problems, from a hotel perspective, easy and actionable. And so from my what, from Kyle's perspective, Kyle would say, Blair's got great ideas, and I can sell these ideas to other hoteliers. I had no idea that he was doing this. Fast forward to the pandemic. Kyle was able to take the Kyle was able, unfortunately, had to take the company down as low as possible to say, we're we've survived, but took the company as low as possible, got into survival mode and asked me to join him. In 2022 I then joined him and said, let's figure out what we can make this company. So in January 2023 we went to his existing board and said, we're going to basically restart the company as traversing AI. It was traverse software, but traversing AI and take it as a B to C Company. So we wanted to keep and maintain all the IP of sweetness, but keep all the contracts and keep everything that we own, and that's why all those integrations exist. It's the legacy business, but we sweetness still represents 1% on the cap table. It was led by Bullpen Capital on our original investor, and we were able to raise money as a seed round with water tower ventures, one of our our new on our new cap table, and that's where we've been for the last for the last two years,
It works out perfectly. I'll hit that this is just a good competition, competition slide. And like I said, because we are much more in the hospitality space, this is why it's very focused on this. We are the only players embedding AI directly into hotel operations. So this ensures hotels own their bookings, their data and those guest relationships, which is really what's allowed us to win that business. So then we talk about the team. This is what our team looks like today. On the background is really who our team is. It's a very small team. So we're a team of seven today. We have some great advisors. Overall. That's who you're seeing the big bold pictures here, but our but our team is very small, we started officially. So if you see Kyle on the far left hand side, Kyle started a company called sweetness.

And we had a very what at the time, was a very messy cap table and now, but now it's beautiful. It's clean, and we own it outright all the IP, and it took a lot of work, but it's done, and it's pretty and clean, and it's all completed.

Fits, fits the areas and the spaces we want to look at. I'd love to dig deeper. Do you have, say, a data room in place? What I would and maybe if you can point me towards I would like to have a more detailed conversation on the tech stack, for sure. And if you can point me towards, say, a demo or any place where traversing is exposed, and I can use that as a customer or consumer, that would be great as well. So I would like to do a little bit of that on my end. We as investors, we haven't looked at this market, the vertical specifically. So would do a bit more research on my end to get educated there as well, and then we would love to come back with some more questions on my end.
