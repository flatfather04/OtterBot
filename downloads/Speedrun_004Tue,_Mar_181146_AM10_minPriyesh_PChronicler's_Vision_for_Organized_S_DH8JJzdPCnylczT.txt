And in case you've been wondering, yes, all those cool features, they work on group chats too. Now, we didn't just flip chronicler because we personally needed it. We're also the messaging experts. Collectively, our team has led, built and shipped features on major messaging platforms that billions of people use every single day, if you like sending your friends stickers on WhatsApp. You've been enjoying something that our CTO built by himself, plus, we've been close friends for a really long time, since middle school, in fact. Now you might not have realized it, but your self texts represent a treasure trove of thoughts and ideas that make up the chronicle of your life. You just need someone to keep it organized. Once again, we're chronicler. Come see us after the show. Wow.

S Speaker 18:06Office almost done. Hi everyone. My name is red, and I am the CEO and co founder of atori, where we bring luxury to the masses, or, like some people have been calling us the luxury team. And the reason why right now is an amazing time to be building this is because luxury is going through its worst crisis in the last 50 years. Why greed? They've been increasing prices like crazy, slashing quality and squeezing the factories they're working with. But in an industry with margins as high as 1,000% where people see decline, we see opportunity. We see the opportunity to totally change the model from a supply driven model, with a ton of middlemen between factories and consumers, increasing prices to a demand driven model, with our marketplace connecting directly factories to consumers. We get data from consumers and social and on our platform give it back to factories. We're able to produce high quality, trendy, affordable good. So how does that work? On the on the factory side, our suite of tools enable them to go direct to consumer through their ghosted brands. We operate a little bit the way DoorDash operates with restaurants and ghost kitchens. That's enabled us to bring unbeatable value to the market, same factory, same material, 10 times cheaper on the consumer side of the product. We're also believed that right now is finally the time for

10:43So Hey everyone, we've got the best for last I was going to pop up confetti cannon, but they said I couldn't do that. So we'll just jump right into it. Imagine a world where vision first AI agents watch your customers and solve your product problems. I'm Liam, and we're deep prediction. We're a cracked AI engineering team with terrifying GTM skills. I ship Gemini at Google, the best vision. LLM co founded project Mariner, which is AGI in Chrome and has founded multiple venture backed startups. My co founder and best friend since 11 years old is David. He led the computer vision team and deployed AI models to increase developer productivity. At Wayfair, our advisors and friends are titans in the AI industry. We all know that analytics don't save you any time or money. So we quit our jobs and we built a revolutionary platform with over 200 agents that watch users and take action. Our agents see when people get stuck, when something is broken, understand why people drop off, and you can even build your own in less than one minute, all this with a single line of code. Since I shipped the first multimodal LLM at Google. We know how to do this at scale better than anyone else. Our early design partners love how we directly impact revenue. They can find bugs before it gets to support, reveal conversion issues, detect fraud, and finally, get rid of those graphs and charts from amplitude, post hog and full story, we started this idea only 55 days ago. We walked we're live with five design partners. We watched 25,000 sessions and found over 50 problems. We're in conversations with 15 new, exciting customers, and our wait list has over 250 individual companies. How do we get this wait list? Well, we're influencers in the product management space with over 70,000 followers, which makes customer acquisition a lot easier in the future, we don't just identify issues and create tickets, but we close the loop between coding and design agents that make changes autonomously. We make decisions grounded in every customer's actions, not just their words, thus replacing the boring parts of Product Management UX research and data analytics. Come chat with us. We're deep prediction, and we're going to build a billion dollar company, and this is when I was supposed to shoot that confetti cannon pretend it's here. Thank you guys. If you can get a round of applause for all the founders, so good to see you all in not to screw up your outro, and that's a pre recorded roll tape. Well, that was fun, and in many ways, this is just the beginning of your devotee experience for everyone tuning in online, thank you. We appreciate you joining us, and of course, have to remind you to slam that like button and connect with founders. For those of you here in person, though, the party is far from over. Now that we've wrapped up the pitches, we invite you to step outside and join us in the founders for lunch. I bet she's pointing at the doors right now just to make sure you know where you're going. While you enjoy lunch, our team will be working behind the scenes to flip the space into a full demo Hall, where you'll get to meet the founders, one on one. At 1pm, sharp will reopen these beautiful doors and welcoming back inside to continue the experience.
