S Speaker 10:04in some cases, you know, startups that we invest in, over the long run, become go to market partners or some cases, customers or we become their customers. And so there's several ways we partner with startups.

S Speaker 20:23Yeah. Nice to meet you. So, I'm from India. I'm an engineer by discipline. Been working with a lot of early stage startups across different industries in growth and product. And more recently, I moved to the US for my MBA. Over the last two years, I've been involved in venture working with several different firms, including Morpheus and Menlo, and very recently joined the team here at Qualcomm as a senior. Yeah.

S Speaker 32:57saw before that was before Congress security was a fraud detection company, cybersecurity, fraud detection. So adjacent to software security. And then before that was actually digital media. So I was I was one of the earliest employees at InMobi, a big mobile, Indian and global advertising network company. Those some of those crew I know they like to claim one of India's first unicorns, I don't know how true that is, but I was at InMobi. I was like the third employee in the US. We went from three to like 500 at launch. And then before that, a company called comScore and digital media so comScore was the Nielsen ratings for Internet that we were I was there through an IPO. I joined them right out of grad school afterwards. And I was fortunate to be part of their IPO and their team as we went through that day, so it's fun. But startups my entire career. I've been on the executive team numerous times and all of these places. But pixie is actually really my first kind of founding role.

3:58started turning when did you start the company?
S Speaker 34:00We started the company in the summer of 2022, almost exactly two years ago. Actually at this point. We the the Genesis was interesting. So I'll give a little bit of more Congress history. And I'll tell you, the pixie sort of is very related. So contrast was actually the point. And maybe how do you hear about pixie and maybe like, what's your level of depth in the world of software? Security, specifically, if you spent much time there?

S Speaker 24:33Not pretty extensively. So while we were researching the space of AI agents and security, and basically came across as one of the top players, so that's what I thought maybe starting a conversation. Yeah, good.

S Speaker 14:45cybersecurity. We are getting up to speed on cybersecurity. I should have added another person on our team. He's been spending a lot of time in cyber Bucha more recently and so we I mean, across the board essentially, across,

S Speaker 15:12startups in that space. We're looking at startups in software lifecycle security. So we're getting more familiar with cybersecurity. We did have a great accent and that cybersecurity that was done out of Israel. That was centered on one word, and then we have a few investments in Israel in cyber space. Yeah.

S Speaker 35:35hotbed for cyber companies. So I'll give you the quick background about plungers as well as it'll make go make it clearer transition to victory. So there's a reason there's 1000s of types. There's been so many niches with the type of security right your endpoints and your software and your operating system, and your passwords and your data and there's like a million different silos and they truly are in silence like what did people say waves is going to take over the world, even when you have when you need another 25 products to truly have the right

S Speaker 36:13In the world that we both pixieset focused on in my previous coming to focus on this is the sector that we would call software security application security dev SEC ops. All of those is that same kind of category, which is about which is very simple premise. software that's written well, is not susceptible to attacks. If you write the software correctly, the way that you should write it, you are not susceptible to attacks because you will make sure that they're not trying to do something malicious with the flow so that they can make the software behave the way it wasn't intended to behave, for example, so that's our entire category, which is really truly about finding bugs and thought was really what it's primarily focused. On this, this kind of application security space. So the Quick Issue, there's like there's a whole bunch of first generation tools. This is like 1520 years ago that did the most basic automation of finding basic vulnerabilities in software. These are companies that you've heard of like checkmarks, and Vera code and fortify was bought by HP and then microfocus, IBM part of business in the microfine, the app scan space, white hat, there's a ton of companies in this like first generation like the basics, automation of security. Then we have the second generation of companies, which was a contrast and sneak loading, most certainly heard of, and a few other cembra a code QL which is a company that you have acquired, but they were the second generation the big difference was like they were trying to make that entire process of finding vulnerabilities but faster and easier, so that you can fit it into a development workflow much more consistently and quicker. So that was the whole genesis of DedSec ops or DevOps to show that. That was 10 to two contractors that are believed that contracts are really unsafe, they had sneak was if we make finding vulnerabilities accurate and quick, then we could just read it back to a developer right away and then they'll fix it and then the whole cycle starts again. That's not what happened. What happened was, we automate all the process of finding the vulnerabilities, building it into your development workflow, creating a JIRA ticket sending it back to the developer, and then they never do it. But they don't actually fix anything that comes out of these tools because whether they have last manual why it's manual because that last step is entirely manual and what isn't it the developer having to work that security for them? That's not their day job and they're not experts on candidly so that last mile if you ask anyone even at Qualcomm certainly has security SPLC development

S Speaker 18:40we do. back as an engineer, my experience was similar as well,
we do. back as an engineer, my experience was similar as well,
we do. back as an engineer, my experience was similar as well,
we do. back as an engineer, my experience was similar as well,
S Speaker 38:44as if you ask them to all say like dev psych ops was is great, amazing story. But the reality is, it's only like two thirds automated that last third is entirely manual. And it doesn't work because developers don't do this stuff. They're not experts on this. And the security teams aren't big enough, nor do they know how to write code. So you can't actually close that loop. And so that's kind of what led us to pixie that Congress had fantastic pas fantastic customers need to build a big business in that space. But the reality is, they've automated a lot of the process of finding and weaving into developer workflow, but the last mile to actually realize the benefits of all this stuff is not happening because it's all manual, too slow and too expensive. And so that's that's kind of where pixio About so we says, aren't we have no goal, no intention of rebuilding and contrast or a secret like that? That's done a good job. But the last mile which even in 2024 the state of the art is manually rewriting source code via develop or manually reviewing a finding from one of the scanners to see if it's real or not, or applies to my business is very tight and painful. And so
as if you ask them to all say like dev psych ops was is great, amazing story. But the reality is, it's only like two thirds automated that last third is entirely manual.

S Speaker 19:48that's a I have today so you can fix using Yeah, I know are
that's a I have today so you can fix using Yeah, I know are
that's a I have today so you can fix using Yeah, I know are
that's a I have today so you can fix using Yeah, I know are
S Speaker 112:57it so happens then just give this out because you don't even need to look up. It's like a look at array of 10 entries. Is that right? Exactly.
it so happens then just give this out because you don't even need to look up. It's like a look at array of 10 entries. Is that right? Exactly.
it so happens then just give this out because you don't even need to look up. It's like a look at array of 10 entries. Is that right? Exactly.
it so happens then just give this out because you don't even need to look up. It's like a look at array of 10 entries. Is that right? Exactly.
S Speaker 114:51Bottom. So dumb question. And what happens if you just take your code base and say, give it to AI? And then you know, I get it that today you have a whole bunch of other tools that will find about us and then recommend and then somebody will need to triage those and say, Okay, this is right. This is not right. Right. My guess is the answer the question I'm going to ask, ask the question and add to that as well. Yeah, you can correct me which is why don't if you if you can just take the codebase and say find all one durability security vulnerabilities in this code and recommend fixes. Yeah, pull that as that end to end without having to use all the existing tools that you might be using today. Isn't that the Holy Grail? of AI tools for cybersecurity? Or, or, and then you're saying that AI is not good enough today, to be able to do that.
Bottom. So dumb question. And what happens if you just take your code base and say, give it to AI? And then you know, I get it that today you have a whole bunch of other tools that will find about us and then recommend and then somebody will need to triage those and say, Okay, this is right.

S Speaker 316:04So that would be the Holy Grail, I think, but I think there's also there's also two things you have to think about when it comes to finding vulnerabilities and code with the current code scanning businesses that are out there, right. They use a technique called static code analysis where they're like looking at the syntax tree and understanding data flows, and they'll do this whole thing they can think about that whole process. Is not It's not like we built it right. My co founder I have built these in our previous company. So we built exactly that. It's not trivial. But what you're really trying to do is you're trying to apply general pattern and identify general patterns and very specific code snippets, right I've currently I'm looking for someone that does A and then B and then see if I see that pattern that I'm going to tell you there's a vulnerability. So the way that system works is you look for general code pattern in a very specific sample, which is why it's riddled with false positives because it's not taking the context of that exact thing. And then looking at it the other way so I what I have to think will happen is
So that would be the Holy Grail, I think, but I think there's also there's also two things you have to think about when it comes to finding vulnerabilities and code with the current code scanning businesses that are out there, right.

S Speaker 117:05why don't we go So context windows are getting bigger I mean, the while the context window for this is not big enough to ingest your entire your specific entire quote.
why don't we go So context windows are getting bigger I mean, the while the context window for this is not big enough to ingest your entire your specific entire quote.

why don't we go So context windows are getting bigger I mean, the while the context window for this is not big enough to ingest your entire your specific entire quote.
S Speaker 117:20What if context window gets big enough such that they can ingest your million lines of code?
What if context window gets big enough such that they can ingest your million lines of code?
What if context window gets big enough such that they can ingest your million lines of code?
What if context window gets big enough such that they can ingest your million lines of code?
S Speaker 317:26I think it'll be 10 times and I think that's what will happen. I really do think that what will happen, I think we will get to a point where there's scanners in this business that are going to be built that way where the context windows are big enough and it can do it fast enough that it makes sense. Now, the other challenge is that you actually have to do it really, really often. So the financial director displayed here too. We know when I you know, I got with Sydney this morning city runs 7000 pipeline scan a day on their code bases. So to run a massive context window on every commit of code for every development team in their organization can also get very, very, very, very expensive very quickly. If you're having to leverage such a huge context window and let ai do the full analysis from start to finish this different way. I think that'll all work itself out in a few years. I do think it'll all be very simple. But I would think the other half of it is is that we actually have to embed the AI with the right knowledge to because today if I use standard foundational model that a lot of embeddings a lot of the fine tuning. They can do things like SQL injection example again, they'll do that fantastic. They'll do it really well. They'll do a good job. But if you ask him even very critical interviews that are not as popular like Java deserialization with us on the back of wet and cause the Equifax breach. You it will it doesn't know how to fix it. It has no idea how to fix it, because it's not as commonly talked about out there in in the training data. Right. So I think that there's there's ways you can embed that knowledge and that's part of what we do. So you know, the second half of the fixing stuff we use very little a I'd say we use some but not a lot. The triage is almost entirely AI because to do that, the AI is what's at allows us to get the current context of not just saying is this vulnerable, but what we've done for now because we get much more consistent, successful output from the foundational models is we ask it specific attributes of the software. We say for example, is this variable, does it take user input anywhere in this in this variable get used in the system path command in this in this portion of the in the code base because then
I think it'll be 10 times and I think that's what will happen. I really do think that what will happen, I think we will get to a point where there's scanners in this business that are going to be built that way where the context windows are big enough and it can do it fast enough that it makes sense.

S Speaker 119:43the code base which is very, very specific and then this can be more deterministic,

the code base which is very, very specific and then this can be more deterministic,
the code base which is very, very specific and then this can be more deterministic,
S Speaker 319:48it's much more accurate consistently in that way. And it gets really precise answered. And then when I put that together, then we kind of have an extra model where we get these specific data points from the LLM on the specific attributes of the software. And then we know if like if there's no user input, and it doesn't get used in the system command, I'm telling you it's a false positive. And I can tell you that with with the competence and we can explain that to the user as well. And so that's why our tree is is very heavy AI to get the contextual nuggets of information and then we mash it together within with a deterministic expert system level Mason disposition on here's what you should do with this knowledge, which is the same way that humans do it today. The same way the app SEC engineers on your team are operating as of right now. Okay,
it's much more accurate consistently in that way. And it gets really precise answered.

S Speaker 320:36that's what we've got. So the Scourge is actually very troubling. You go to GitHub, you install us on a repository and from there on out, you connect us to whatever standard Do you have, if you have a standard tool, and then we are effectively like a co pilot for your development team and security where we will triage planing. We will rewrite code, not just give you an example, we'll actually rewrite your code as if it's a co pilot on your team and make changes so now developer literally inches, click Merge button, see the chain. There's still the loop because they have to be the human loop for sake of like, who's making this commit or approving this commit for sake of the codebase. But then they just took an emerge on at this point when they use Yeah, I'll give you a show you wondering about a slider that makes it really easy. There's a there's an open source project that I can show you real quick that has been using us for some time. It's a sample project. I know it's a big open source project that is using our product.

S Speaker 321:45very popular open source project, which is a basic and open source PDF editor, this thing called Sterling PDF in Java. I was like 30 Every day I think it was like 2000 Sorry, it's pretty wild. And get homeland it's, it's just read this project. Interestingly enough, they actually removed it from the readme but a few months ago, they used to say like this project was originally written by co pilot by GitHub profile, it was actually a key contributor to writing the base level is this project way back when, but there so what's happening in writing this product, you're adding new features every day, and they are they've had our box on the back of it I'll show you what it looks like. So all these these chain code changes you see here were made by our bond because he has a vendor buy fix he bought, bought that's our software. If I go back to like February 1, because when they installed it, which doesn't release first before they were like playing with it, but right here's where they installed it. So these purple icons mean they merged they accepted the change we made and the red icons mean they didn't accept them, they canceled our extended grades 80s For percentage like that, which is much higher than we were hoping for our target 50 or higher, but you'll notice like on the first day they installed it, they like merged in seven or eight different fixes or software. But these are like these are critical vulnerabilities. These are the kinds of things that will get through socks, every denial of service attacks, command injection can take over the system in which it's operating the host system and some other kind of big ones here and then since that first day or since February 1, you'll notice a lot of the same hardening and what these hardening examples are is they wrote some code, they are going to co pilot, their AI coding assistant wrote some code. And now we are making fixes to make sure that code is actually written the way it should be written. So it's not vulnerable to some issue. And so all these hardening suggestions, for example, are they wrote some code, original code in here? Yeah, they opened up this login, fixes PR with a fix some thing and then we came back right after within a few minutes of hey, I looked at your PR, and I have some suggestions for you. So we said, again, it's like having an extra engineer on your team who's just fixing the security side. And so our PR bug came in and said, Hey, I have some suggestions. You this this the way you wrote this, this code is actually susceptible. To a null pointer exception that we fix this. And so now all you have to do is you click Merge, and you're now improved their code as it goes through the system interesting in that path. And then the last example here, like you'll see kind of more recently, in fact, more recently, they started they haven't been installed with third party scanner. Cool. This one Bolsonaro very, very popular one. And the same thing is happening now we're fixing stuff at sonar is finding as well. Yeah. So that they don't have to do that way. But you'll see like actually the most recent fix of the SQL injection and over still make this mistake all the time

Yeah, they opened up this login, fixes PR with a fix some thing and then we came back right after within a few minutes of hey, I looked at your PR, and I have some suggestions for you. So we said, again, it's like having an extra engineer on your team who's just fixing the security side. And so our PR bug came in and said, Hey, I have some suggestions. You this this the way you wrote this, this code is actually susceptible. To a null pointer exception that we fix this. And so now all you have to do is you click Merge, and you're now improved their code as it goes through the system interesting in that path. And then the last example here, like you'll see kind of more recently, in fact, more recently, they started they haven't been installed with third party scanner. Cool. This one Bolsonaro very, very popular one. And the same thing is happening now we're fixing stuff at sonar is finding as well. Yeah. So that they don't have to do that way. But you'll see like actually the most recent fix of the SQL injection and over still make this mistake all the time

The executive level metrics is that like, Security Leadership reports on that we directly drive our meantime your remediation, meaning how long did it take me to fix a vulnerability once I found it? And just so you know, there's plenty of research out there the average it takes companies to fix a critical high vulnerability right now is like 150 days, just to be clear, not hours, not minutes.

S Speaker 326:09metric is time. The other is just simple burn down, like how much how many open vulnerabilities do I have? So I'll give you an example. Three weeks ago, I met with the security leader at a very large financial by the top of the Fortune 20 patient. They have a very mature application security program and in their business, the 10,000 critical high vulnerabilities that they already know about. They know about these I've known about him for five or six years. The challenge is just getting them fixed like their only challenge right now. They know what line of code it is. They know what resources they know what it is. They just gotta get them fixed. There's 10,000 of them in one company. This is not uncommon. The data will tell you like most large company I'm sure if you find great people talking they'll say you probably have 100 to 200,000 on address known vulnerabilities, you've already found them. We just haven't fixed them yet. And so that is like really the chain we're going after. And for them. You know, they told us we've known these 10,000 for years for decades. As a matter of fact, obviously, every time we fix a few a few new ones come up so it's like a never ending backlog. And so that remember that if I can get that 10,000 down. The value to me is a myth. That activestate person told me he wrote into a business case I'm doing solving this problem and it was the first business case he wrote that was measured in person centuries of value that was his metric. At the end of it. I'm saving like literally hundreds of years of time

S Speaker 327:53Well I would say anyone who's definitely a sizable company, right? Well, they're small enough. They don't care so much about security or they're not using tools but you know, if you have a concern as always. We're still pre revenue as a matter of fact, not for long. Give us another few weeks. But our our first two deals are each going to be 150 to 250,000. They're big enterprises. I think those are obviously much larger companies that are going through the process. I would imagine like the typical ACP for a kind of 500 to 1000 person development team. Company is between 50 and 100k is what we will say. Those first few the first few deals that we're working on are both kind of 50 to one and development companies developer.

S Speaker 329:07We wanted to build that open source foundation what we have to empower this kind of tool to be built and scale with the enterprises. That was once we spent a fair amount of time building that foundation. And just truly building it in a cave circuit. Those projects, it's called Code water or cod, code modern IO, is that the thing was published last August, so almost 12 months. It'll be coming up on Portland. And the end, so that was a big part of it. And the second reason was, we really had a, I still have a goal, but like we had a key focus. And if we build this and have a very simple Self Serve program, where developers can just come and deploy this thing and install it and adopt it, we'll get this massive adoption and we did see great adoption, we have 10s of 1000s of repos, we're using our free product already. I show you one example of many, many lifetimes that are using it and getting the value of so every time they click Merge, we can we've delivered quantifiable value to them. So that was always a bullish show that we're delivering quantifiable value to whoever might be a small company, the company, open source shop. So we focus on that for the first eight months of the product. We ship all of this in August of last year. So at the very end of August, so we're about 11 months into the product being out in the wild. But then about three months ago, we said hey, we don't know 10,000 repurposing, install this user guys and getting murdered. But that's not going to translate into revenue as quickly as we want and we can go to sneak around which they did not speak. For years, I think to get to their first million in revenue. There's like that, but we can go that route, but we're not patient enough to go that we said, we're gonna now also go after Midmark enterprises. So for the last three months, we've been chasing, we refocused our the bulk of our energy at the bigger enterprises and within markets, which also came into what we did I contrast anyway, that's the network we have and it's already in just a few months delivered. Really exciting both pipeline as well as revenue opportunities are going to close in the next few months. So we feel good about that path. I still do think we will have this two sided data market as we get more mature that the developer is pulling adoption through easy to deploy easy to install, getting fixes, like the Sterling stuff I showed you, but also working through and with security teams app. You know, the Oracle and the city and the Morgan Stanley and those kinds of companies also drive

S Speaker 331:45We raised a we raised just over $8 million as a seed in summer of 2022. So we're not going to one reporting not that we knew investment from past lives. I think that we're quite happy with what happened I contrast and so we raised 8 billion as a seed round in August 22. We have not raised against himself that was meant to last us two years. It's not gonna last us more like a two and a half years through like January of next year. And so where we are, and we raised the 8 million just just to get to like 37 point 7 million post evaluation at that point. We're gonna go My plan is right now is to go raise a proper series A in the summer of next year, about about a year from now, because I don't have the pipeline I have the deal or have the POCs going on. We just got to get them over the finish line over the next several months. So I think by the summer of next year easily no doubt like a million in revenue we will have to do proper raise but our cash tickets for January to the end of January. And so what I'm it's funny just like you met with our one of our friends before meaning our current investors were very supportive and very bullish on where we're at. So they, they kind of told us they would support us building a bridge or a pre a or something that you sent them to kind of give us another. Let's just say 12 month it has plenty of Bucha built into it to get to a point where we go raise a proper A and we do something else so I'm probably going to do that raise in the next few months. Most likely it'll just be internal. But I told them part of my meeting with them today was if I find the right partners who will give me even more certainty to get to the million or 2 million or five that I involved in now rather than at the end. So that's kind of where I'm at. And what we're thinking financially over the next kind of think about

And so what I'm it's funny just like you met with our one of our friends before meaning our current investors were very supportive and very bullish on where we're at. So they, they kind of told us they would support us building a bridge or a pre a or something that you sent them to kind of give us another. Let's just say 12 month it has plenty of Bucha built into it to get to a point where we go raise a proper A and we do something else so I'm probably going to do that raise in the next few months. Most likely it'll just be internal. But I told them part of my meeting with them today was if I find the right partners who will give me even more certainty to get to the million or 2 million or five that I involved in now rather than at the end. So that's kind of where I'm at. And what we're thinking financially over the next kind of think about
S Speaker 133:38from our standpoint, sir, I think we're we could be better partners around day because we're, we don't have like, we do have somebody working on an active thesis on cyber but we don't like that built up thesis that we can say with conviction today that you know, we're gonna go early enough in this bullet, but I think we can keep meeting each other as you're building towards a

S Speaker 334:40The closest thing is is that the vendors who built the scanning, the traditional scanning tools, the sneak the even GitHub acquired a company in this space for what they position on their advanced security product, which is out on GitHub. All of them are starting to go this path right because AI enables them to they'll do things so you'll see the sneaks doing and you'll see the varicose and the check marks with either the not so innovative player who haven't really innovative 10 year they're now using this as a path and so that's the closest thing you'll see. But I think for us like the there's the conviction to focus on this part of that problem. Allows us to kind of get a lot deeper because they think like the triage. They're not incentivized to do the triage as you can imagine, like they're the ones providing the results. If they all of a sudden start saying halfway results. It's not really in their best interest to do that, because that's their revenue stream. So I think for us like that's the closest I've seen and they all are doing every single one of them, like every couple months is announcing this capability or the fixing capability, I should say, but they're doing about it, I think a very simplistic way. Okay. What I what I'm happy to give you all more data as ABC company that company can come across you won't be that fun to send them my way. I'm happy to. And then, you know, for us selfishly like, what you're welcome. You have a lot of software, if there's teams that you think are your dev SEC ops team or your product security team, that there's people there that we can talk to,

S Speaker 136:09we would love to talk to them. I think we can do that as well. We'll send this out. The only thing is that they won't engage with you at this stage, nor appearance, they will engage with you as you grow. Just because there were a lot of vendors in the past. So they're like you know what let let them get to a certain scale and then we'll engage with them. So the typically somebody what I'll do is if you send me that deck of product or something, I'll send it over to them and it's exciting me if it's a burning matters.
