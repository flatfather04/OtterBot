S Speaker 21:58Absolutely. And great to meet you, Tyler. Data. We've been talking for a couple of weeks now. So finally good to have this on the calendar. I'm one of the newest members of the team. I have joined Qualcomm about a month back in a senior associate role. I am a graduate of UCLA Anderson this year, so freshly into the venture scene, but prior to this, I was working with a couple of funds, including Menlo and Morpheus and prior to that I have an operator's experience at a slew of early stage ventures. So that's where I come from.

S Speaker 32:30Awesome, ya know, great to meet you. We're of course certainly have heard of Qualcomm. And I think just to set the context for this conversation is you know from on the raising side, just get ahead of that we're not raising right now. So really just heads down on product execution, especially going into q3, which is coming up pretty quickly here. So I do think that in terms of fundraising we might start looking at some point in q3, but really just the focus for us is executing on the current product iteration, which you guys actually got us a very good day because this week, we've rolled a handful of features out to production and then over the next couple of weeks, we're very much going to be polishing the app experience. So we've got a Yeah, we have a big Tech Week events coming up for the first week of June. So a bit of a rallying day for us. And yeah,

S Speaker 13:28I mean, so Taylor, we're excited. I mean, we've been on the hunt for some Whoo, that can make us more efficient. So hence, for that reason, as well as call this, yeah, we're looking forward.

S Speaker 37:33Yeah, I know. It's a great question. So for us, it's very much a matter of focus, and it's really on private equity and venture specifically and those customer types, really the parts of the investment cycle that we focus on our diligence and postcodes, so portfolio management and monitoring, I would say a good way to think about the sections of the workflow that we target our call it the first conversation you have in a prospective company, maybe the first point of access in the data room, up to actually sending reports to LPs. Right. So we don't really touch sourcing workflows right now. We sort of be after that.
Yeah, I know. It's a great question.

S Speaker 38:34Yeah. Gotcha. Yeah. And then maybe just to start on the diligence side, because one thing that we know, you know, on the VC side of things, depending on the stage of the investment that you guys might be able to later from A to B, you know, how heavy of a process is diligence right now and where, where are those types of things right, if 50% of the time is being spent on the process of the diligence process, are there particular pain points, right, that there's just a lot of back and forth manual work, that sort of thing.
Yeah. Gotcha. Yeah. And then maybe just to start on the diligence side, because one thing that we know, you know, on the VC side of things, depending on the stage of the investment that you guys might be able to later from A to B, you know, how heavy of a process is diligence right now and where, where are those types of things right, if 50% of the time is being spent on the process of the diligence process, are there particular pain points, right, that there's just a lot of back and forth manual work, that sort of thing.

S Speaker 19:09I mean, see, the diligence process for us is so so typically I'll describe where what we do and maybe I can describe the process of diligence to the first step in our processes. If any particular startup had one or two meetings, and then we say the main investor was working on it says, Okay, this is interesting enough to bring it to the team. We bring it to our Monday morning, Monday after partners meeting, and then you say, Okay, guys, here's what the investment is. And if somebody else has looked at something, somebody else has an opinion that we say, okay, you might this was interesting or not interesting. If it's not interesting past. It's interesting. Then the lead investment manager will continue to dig in and continue to dig in as initially you know, okay, let's spend more time and it'll go to market and technology mode. Still not getting access to the data room, per se, but enough information such that you're able to form a story, or you're able to commit yourself and then we'll have competitors or things like that, and then at that point if then the lead investment investor thinks that this is what pursuing them, they go in with a stronger connection to this partner meeting and say, Guys, we need we should do something what we call the safe one. And in that state one, that investment manager puts together back usually with random metrics, which is here's the company as a product isn't technology. Yes, competitors. Here's the financials. And then we discuss it within a group of four to five people who, across the globe who have some weeping might have some experience in that field. And then at that point, they say, Okay, let's, here's the things that we want to spend more time on. At that point, we get access to data and when we get access to customers, all of that, assuming we still have that conviction. And, and at that point, you do like a full due diligence across everything, including financials and, and then we put together like, stage two back and that is very federal, across each one of those categories. And then we will financial modeling, financial analysis and exit analysis and all of that, like from a financial standpoint, that's the diligence step. And what that involves is you know, did you look at it gross margins, what are the risks of gross margins? Or did you look at what like if it's a hardware as a service company, right. So what are the capex? Whatever like all the typical questions that you would require in order to get to a model that you're projecting, because there's management projection, and there's, there's our projection, which which are typically SUPPOSED TO BE DIFFERENT unless you think and which is, okay, here's a management, optimistic projection and as the conservative are, what we think might be a realistic scenario, considering all the risks, so So that's that's what we do. We've put together financials it's, I would say about 30% of the discussions revolve around financials, and then then the rest 70% of the discussion revolves around
I mean, see, the diligence process for us is so so typically I'll describe where what we do and maybe I can describe the process of diligence to the first step in our processes. If any particular startup had one or two meetings, and then we say the main investor was working on it says, Okay, this is interesting enough to bring it to the team.

S Speaker 113:11so, yeah, and then then typically after that, we vote for the deal and and then we pick it to an IC but our IC is like if a deal goes through an ICS for the most part, it's like the deal doesn't get rejected in the nicey nicey meeting. It's like a half an hour believe it at that point, scrub it off that you know that it's
so, yeah, and then then typically after that, we vote for the deal and and then we pick it to an IC but our IC is like if a deal goes through an ICS for the most part, it's like the deal doesn't get rejected in the nicey nicey meeting.

It's like a half an hour believe it at that point, scrub it off that you know that it's
S Speaker 313:41okay. Yes, I mean, just suddenly disappear back and know that there's very much what is typical, right in terms of the BC governance process, but there's very much this collection of knowledge over time, right. You know, in phase one, you get sort of the initial groupings of data that you know, either pass or fail to the FIT test, so the initial screen and that that building there, we'll be adding more we'll talk with customers, we'll talk about management, that sort of thing and sort of building up this picture of the company. So I think this is a good addition to kind of jump into some of the core functionality with metal. So let me pull this up here and just feel free to interrupt me if you do have questions. The one thing I want to come out of this with is, you know, our roots, really the company itself. We actually started as a data infrastructure platform when we launched at YC last year, and it's important context because at its core, you know, everything we're looking at is built on top of metals API's, we actually launched the SAS product itself. This January, we spent all of last year building the infrastructure. And then we chose, you know, the vertical and working with funds and private equity and VC in particular towards the end of last year and basically took sort of a general LLM data infrastructure and we double down for financial data in particular, right. So I think a good way to understand the differences there is if you took a you know, a p&l Right you throw it into chat, GPT and acid, so like, you know, redo that data and summarize etc. It's not going to get all those metrics accurately. So that's for one and then also putting it into the workflow. So that's right. So actually, you know, following the analysts along their diligence process, giving them sort of soft points to collect and audit information before they move things up the chain. So there's the since we mentioned workflow that we're building into that box, so I can kind of go through some of the main pieces here. So we're actually starting in what's called the Explore page. And this is just a way to basically search through all of the data that you might upload in the metals. So we've got a couple of just public companies voted in here. For example purposes, but we really work with private data sets almost exclusively. So let's just run some basic filters here. And let's say I'm working a deal on we were right so I can first filter. And then once they're created usually, we were when these files are uploaded, we actually run a lot of extraction on each document. So jumping into one document here, you've got the presentation itself, we have the source material, there's a lot of Texas numbers in these texts. And then if I go to the top, you know to financial metrics, these are some of the metrics we've pulled out of this document in particular so we get, you know, certain financial metrics, we can link them back to where they came from, in the source material themselves whether or not their actual numbers are forecasted. But it's just one dime, right? So as you roll more and more information, it's about we aggregate and roll things up under a company you so if I go with a company here I'll jump into the we were this is sort of a macro view of all the data that we have uploaded to Mel started we were concerned. So yeah, well we
okay. Yes, I mean, just suddenly disappear back and know that there's very much what is typical, right in terms of the BC governance process, but there's very much this collection of knowledge over time, right. You know, in phase one, you get sort of the initial groupings of data that you know, either pass or fail to the FIT test, so the initial screen and that that building there, we'll be adding more we'll talk with customers, we'll talk about management, that sort of thing and sort of building up this picture of the company.

And then once they're created usually, we were when these files are uploaded, we actually run a lot of extraction on each document. So jumping into one document here, you've got the presentation itself, we have the source material, there's a lot of Texas numbers in these texts. And then if I go to the top, you know to financial metrics, these are some of the metrics we've pulled out of this document in particular so we get, you know, certain financial metrics, we can link them back to where they came from, in the source material themselves whether or not their actual numbers are forecasted. But it's just one dime, right? So as you roll more and more information, it's about we aggregate and roll things up under a company you so if I go with a company here I'll jump into the we were this is sort of a macro view of all the data that we have uploaded to Mel started we were concerned. So yeah, well we
okay. Yes, I mean, just suddenly disappear back and know that there's very much what is typical, right in terms of the BC governance process, but there's very much this collection of knowledge over time, right. You know, in phase one, you get sort of the initial groupings of data that you know, either pass or fail to the FIT test, so the initial screen and that that building there, we'll be adding more we'll talk with customers, we'll talk about management, that sort of thing and sort of building up this picture of the company. So I think this is a good addition to kind of jump into some of the core functionality with metal. So let me pull this up here and just feel free to interrupt me if you do have questions. The one thing I want to come out of this with is, you know, our roots, really the company itself. We actually started as a data infrastructure platform when we launched at YC last year, and it's important context because at its core, you know, everything we're looking at is built on top of metals API's, we actually launched the SAS product itself. This January, we spent all of last year building the infrastructure. And then we chose, you know, the vertical and working with funds and private equity and VC in particular towards the end of last year and basically took sort of a general LLM data infrastructure and we double down for financial data in particular, right. So I think a good way to understand the differences there is if you took a you know, a p&l Right you throw it into chat, GPT and acid, so like, you know, redo that data and summarize etc. It's not going to get all those metrics accurately. So that's for one and then also putting it into the workflow. So that's right. So actually, you know, following the analysts along their diligence process, giving them sort of soft points to collect and audit information before they move things up the chain. So there's the since we mentioned workflow that we're building into that box, so I can kind of go through some of the main pieces here. So we're actually starting in what's called the Explore page. And this is just a way to basically search through all of the data that you might upload in the metals. So we've got a couple of just public companies voted in here. For example purposes, but we really work with private data sets almost exclusively. So let's just run some basic filters here. And let's say I'm working a deal on we were right so I can first filter.

But it's just one dime, right? So as you roll more and more information, it's about we aggregate and roll things up under a company you so if I go with a company here I'll jump into the we were this is sort of a macro view of all the data that we have uploaded to Mel started we were concerned. So yeah, well we
S Speaker 117:01can can you show me what was the document that was uploaded?
can can you show me what was the document that was uploaded?
can can you show me what was the document that was uploaded?
can can you show me what was the document that was uploaded?
S Speaker 317:06Yeah, so there's a handful right here on the source cleanse if I go to any particular metric, let's just pull this one out. And we'll jump over to
Yeah, so there's a handful right here on the source cleanse if I go to any particular metric, let's just pull this one out. And we'll jump over to
Yeah, so there's a handful right here on the source cleanse if I go to any particular metric, let's just pull this one out. And we'll jump over to
Yeah, so there's a handful right here on the source cleanse if I go to any particular metric, let's just pull this one out. And we'll jump over to
S Speaker 117:17the public. Okay, this time, what about like, you know, you don't have a typical series a start up, that would have been done, and then they would have some information and they wouldn't have some information. Right? In the initial deck, right. So from a public company standpoint, I think you can, it's easy to extract them because they have a lot of information. What about a series, a startup, where you're trying to extract information? Maybe better, you don't have permission?
the public. Okay, this time, what about like, you know, you don't have a typical series a start up, that would have been done, and then they would have some information and they wouldn't have some information.

What about a series, a startup, where you're trying to extract information? Maybe better, you don't have permission?
S Speaker 317:58Yeah, and that's really the majority of the data types we work with. We'll get some better synthetic data in here to simulate that experience. But we really work with teams that just work with private company datasets. So we're quite familiar with, you know, call like diligence is at least in the early stages, if it's a seed stage company, we have been on the other side of that diligence, so it really wasn't around but of course, as you you know, getting more information about the company over time as the company matures as well, that was there to basically thrown any information we have. So for example, you know, you've invested in us and then the monthly updates come in, right we leave you the highs and lows and getting financials, you would throw that into metal. Again, it'll be aggregated under the company view and you have this sort of rolling collection of knowledge, which we do have a lot of parsing for right so even down to the time series elements. These are really specific things that need to be coded. They don't come out of the box and LM does not know the difference. Between q1 and q2 and doesn't know the significance between the two either. So that's a lot of the work that we do.
Yeah, and that's really the majority of the data types we work with. We'll get some better synthetic data in here to simulate that experience.

S Speaker 118:58That's good. Actually, pretty good, because then you get a view of how this has been performing over the years. And this is something that currently there's a lot of this has manual for us. Right? Right. You know the way we do it is we have an air table. And then we create it like our finance team has created a quarterly update air table. And then they have to go manually fill that in from the data that they've received from for tax financials. Right, which is nobody wants, nobody likes doing it at all. And yeah, it can be automated such that I can drop a PDF or sometimes an email, email, or or an Excel and if you will be able to populate just from that. That will be that will be a big big time saver.

S Speaker 320:13Okay, so it's bad I will say. I mean, it's funny you mentioned
Okay, so it's bad I will say. I mean, it's funny you mentioned
Okay, so it's bad I will say. I mean, it's funny you mentioned
Okay, so it's bad I will say. I mean, it's funny you mentioned
S Speaker 120:19that then like if you if you're able to do it, nobody loves doing as you can imagine, nobody loves doing it. And if you can automate that, that's a big thing. Playing

S Speaker 320:26from Priyesh is a real trap. Yeah, absolutely. So that is this first sort of half of metal dose, right. It's really the data inside, right? Just throw data our way and this is sort of the roots of the infrastructure platform as well where you know, when we first started you guys, you have a bit of engineering background. Sure. But the, you know, we started just to get these data format, formatted rather the way to tell and interact with them, right. But now we've started to pull out things very specifically values in particular right way to financial values, and we can also interact this using LVM. So there's a lot of ways to sort of synchronously interact with this data in metal as well. So let's say you know, I'm working a deal with we work or even just I want to know, you know, what's going on with the company right there. We've invested in them so we can go to this explorer page and we can first just do good old fashioned notes are in here. But again, a lot of these values are appended by the AI side of things. So we actually come from a CRM world before we started this company, we were very familiar with the pains of data entry. So it's something we want to avoid whenever we can. But so I filtered by this company here and then let's say you know, I want to just look at we work information where the word lease is included, because we really get into those details, right? And we figure out, you know, extract tables from PDFs, we extract text to find sentiment, we have all of that index. So we've enabled semantic search on top of your data and additionally build keyword search and filtering. It's just a really flexible way to sort of slice and dice GIS data, if you are, is this primarily

S Speaker 121:59semantic search, or can I can I ask it a question and it'll give me an answer using the generative aspect. So excellent.

semantic search, or can I can I ask it a question and it'll give me an answer using the generative aspect. So excellent.
S Speaker 322:10Yeah, so you can you can do that in search here. So just say talking about revenue, for example. Do you have a natural language search like that it would return to sculpts. We also do have a chat as well. So I'm going to order this challenge here.
Yeah, so you can you can do that in search here. So just say talking about revenue, for example. Do you have a natural language search like that it would return to sculpts. We also do have a chat as well. So I'm going to order this challenge here.

S Speaker 122:26Like what about like if it would ask, Hey, analyze revenue trends over the last five quarters for this company, and suggest any anomalies if you detect like, a complex query like that versus because revenue is still keyword searches? Because you can look for revenue?
Like what about like if it would ask, Hey, analyze revenue trends over the last five quarters for this company, and suggest any anomalies if you detect like, a complex query like that versus because revenue is still keyword searches? Because you can look for revenue?

S Speaker 322:50Yeah, so that is a great question. That's actually one of the reports feature a handle. So searching chattier, sort of synchronous, kind of like those, you know, chat very specific question answering for search is more of just like, hey, what data am I working with? The reports feature is actually where you can take basically the deal of information you just created either through search or through chat, and you can ask for those complex queries. So in this example, let's see I ran this or we work where we said, hey, write me a summary of changes and their financials focusing on these metrics and column contradictions specifically. So the way that this feature works, it's actually not bound by the context window and LLM. It has to do with a lot of the way that we orchestrate data in metal. So you can run this over. You know, we did 50 tedious transcripts the other day took about 15 minutes about 3000 pages, and they'll produce some pretty good results. So I'll pull up sort of a cleaned up version here. Again, this is just referencing I think the last three or four years if we were to earnings, and then it splits these out by sections, because I call those metrics out rather than the prompts. And also of course, contradictions, right so spotting I mean to zero and I think this is a really important point I want to highlight because to us, if it's not enough, it's not going to be enough rather in this market to just be fast, right. I think in a year from now, every venture fund every PE fund will have some form of workflow automation using AI speed is not going to be the competitive edge or differentiator it's how we can actually use these tools to create insights. And that's really where I want to have it this contradictions piece because that's really what we're driving on. Right? How can we find things that you know, you wouldn't have found because time is effective, right? Are you using patients at the ability of an LM to compare very large disparate data sets and find the commonalities that humans would have a much harder time discovering? That's very much what we're after. That's
Yeah, so that is a great question. That's actually one of the reports feature a handle.

So the way that this feature works, it's actually not bound by the context window and LLM. It has to do with a lot of the way that we orchestrate data in metal. So you can run this over. You know, we did 50 tedious transcripts the other day took about 15 minutes about 3000 pages, and they'll produce some pretty good results. So I'll pull up sort of a cleaned up version here. Again, this is just referencing I think the last three or four years if we were to earnings, and then it splits these out by sections, because I call those metrics out rather than the prompts. And also of course, contradictions, right so spotting I mean to zero and I think this is a really important point I want to highlight because to us, if it's not enough, it's not going to be enough rather in this market to just be fast, right. I think in a year from now, every venture fund every PE fund will have some form of workflow automation using AI speed is not going to be the competitive edge or differentiator it's how we can actually use these tools to create insights. And that's really where I want to have it this contradictions piece because that's really what we're driving on. Right? How can we find things that you know, you wouldn't have found because time is effective, right? Are you using patients at the ability of an LM to compare very large disparate data sets and find the commonalities that humans would have a much harder time discovering? That's very much what we're after. That's
S Speaker 124:43okay. That's interesting. And what about, you know, one of the things that I, as you were describing this one of the things that would be useful for our larger VC firm like we which we invest across the globe, we have about 100 active portfolios in six regions around the globe. And then for, if you think about people, like quotable runs that are global team. For him, it's very important to get this dashboard, which is a very manual process today, a bunch of financer and a bunch of people that are running these groups internationally. Responsible feed this data into something that gets converted to by one person to a dashboard that gets updated on a weekly basis. And our dashboard shows okay, what's performing well, that's not as big if you can often do you do dashboards
okay. That's interesting.

S Speaker 325:46Yes, I'd say is a couple of ways to do that every day, right? Yeah, so actually, there's an attribute in the system for fun. So we actually can attach each company to a fund, and then that's going to enable these cross portfolio comparisons just for that use case that you mentioned right for some of our more complex words. You know, if you have several funds, and you want to know how this performance is doing across those, that's really why we started with the ingestion side of things because we're quite good at getting these metrics and we want to have it so that you know, you have the utmost confidence of throwing that new data into metal. We're going to grab the right metrics will normalize them across these tables. And then we'll just find the attribute attached to each company, you'll be able to start doing those roll ups in those comparisons. I'd say at first, you know, those might be consumable through the API, but it's a really high priority use case for you guys do we can definitely push on that. All the pieces are there more or less without public higher level comparison? So
Yes, I'd say is a couple of ways to do that every day, right? Yeah, so actually, there's an attribute in the system for fun.

S Speaker 126:46right now, you've solved for extraction and ingestion. And then you're making sure the extraction and ingestion pipelines are or at least once the accuracy of your track accuracy for that.

S Speaker 327:00Yeah, so we're actually gonna be rolling out. We do have emails that run in the system. So we expose this right now in chats. Pull this up here. So we run the basically faithfulness and contextual relevance against every output. We'll be rolling out and exposing the sort of hidden behind the scenes right now, but evaluations for financial metrics, and that's actually going back into the experience of humans review, right. So if we go to, you know, we weren't here again, for each of these numbers, we definitely would want to know which ones are higher competence and lower and then giving users the ability to see both the source which we link in the page as well and then you know, having a thumbs up or thumbs down in terms of confidence and making those updates.

S Speaker 327:54So going down here, we process or have some sort of documents as well. We want to make sure we have really high confidence with them. So we will process them and then we actually reconstruct them in metal. We store these as well. Which is going to enable further comparisons.

S Speaker 128:13And what about in the charts? So like we were saying like anomalies, you know, so do you automatically would you say okay, you know what, this company is going to run out of cash in three quarters or two quarters. So you better watch out and then something that we track, right. So cash needs and and then when he's raising another round is an important metric to track for us. And that gets that has to get flagged if that's a big requirement for us. Yeah, or last thing is showing signs of breaking out, which is then you know, then it's important for us to say, should we should we invest more money at this stage?
And what about in the charts?

S Speaker 329:00Right, right. Yeah. And that's actually another piece here why the ingestion is so important, right? Because again, with these numbers being solid and more confident, we can start to enable those proactive alerts, right, we can do both on the downside, you know, let's say we have a worldwide setting of if a company's revenue dips by X percent over two quarters, we want to send that alert automatically, that's really going to come from this table and the other values that we extract will also be able to do that on sentiment. Right. So an interesting use case here with reports feature is can we build a track a financial metric, its trend and can we track the sentiment of what management is saying? Do we find a divergence in those two very, very high confidence but yet, you know, certain financial metrics are heading the other way, flagging that and that's really interesting because these insights they are mixing both qualitative and quantitative data right and then producing your recommendation or at least an alert from that. Yeah, that's what will enable here, okay.
Right, right. Yeah. And that's actually another piece here why the ingestion is so important, right?
