S Speaker 26:49I can imagine, no problem at all. I totally understand. And thanks a lot for taking your time very I went through the launch video pretty interesting, and I see a lot of relevance internally at Qualcomm as well. So wanted to have a initial chat, sort of try to learn what you guys are trying to build. And happy to give you an overview of the fund, how we operate, and then we can take it over from there. Yeah, let's do it. That sounds great, yeah. So I'm a senior associate here in the team, been with the Fund for about a year, a little bit more than a year now. I was prior to that, with some time with Morpheus ventures in LA and then with Menlo Ventures for a short period of time, broadly the fund itself, we've been around for 25 years, corporate venture arm of Qualcomm. So while there is some strategic angle to what we do, a lot of it is following the same financial discipline as of financial VC vote check sizes are two to $15 million so we typically come in at series A but for seed rounds, we have started making, like, doing smaller checks of around 1.52 especially in AI, I would say, and then sector emails, we focus are a lot around IoT, AI, robotics, physical AI is a thesis I'm leading right now. So that's also an interesting space, and why I wanted to talk to you. Robot is computer vision, industrial automation. So a lot of those spaces, and then particularly at Qualcomm, I think we have in expanded across, from a compute platform perspective, expanded across a lot of different platforms, from Cloud inferencing chips to mobile PCs, XRS, IoT, so we feel quite in a good place to make AI investments,

S Speaker 28:41thinking about? I am I'm particularly starting to do that thesis right now. I've looked, we have looked at a lot of in AI physics. I think the area that's speaking, our interest is mostly in robotics. Ai Foundation, model companies for robotics, digital twins, Earth models, things like that. And one of the thesis is, I wanted to sort of explore was whether some of these CFD first companies can sort of evolve to create a foundation model for robotics. Not sure if that will be the case, but that's that's an area exciting for me, personally. It's an area relevant for us. So we, while we haven't taken a very strategic Look at this. It's in space where we would like to make a few investments in, okay,

S Speaker 212:34very interesting, cinnamon, and thanks for the overview. I think what really piqued my interest in what you've said so far, and also at the demo, is the plan to go very horizontal. Some of these problems are quite integrated, like you mentioned. How are you sort of building a model which is so horizontal? At one point you you spoke about, how do you sort of replicate a fault test for a laptop? And at the end of the end, we have astronomical level problems. So how are you building a foundation model, or how are you actually applying the foundation to this physics engine? Yeah,

S Speaker 113:06so what it looks like is this, the types of questions you need to be able to solve or to be useful in an engineering application. They are a mix of within verticals of physics domain, like fluids, structurals, thermals, an EM and then the higher value problems are cross domain problems. All of them, though, come back to one simple thing, like partial differential equations. Our model allows you to quickly resolve partial differential equations. So the first thing we did, the first thing of our model just trains those four separate domains, separately, right? Like a fluids model, a thermals model, an EM model, a structural model. It's, you can think of it as mid level physics inference, like 70 to 90% accurate, really fast, like the car example that I showed in that video where I asked for surface pressure on a car, 4500 times faster than the traditional software. Okay, so once we have that, that's not, I'm gonna be honest, that's not super useful for engineering teams, especially when you have these, like the higher value problems, how do you get really accurate answers? Well, we take the same approach to being able to get cross physics domains. The problem is, we don't have PDS that relate atmospheric molecular level data to structural level data. So when we take customers at least this year, our ease is being able to support 10 customers who have large databases that capture cross domain interactions that we are interested in studying. So it's not about for us right now, it's not about customer pipeline. There's a lot of inbound it's about picking the right ones. The reason ESA for example, by building them a custom model, we don't need their data. We can use their data to learn the equation that relates the structures to the material level, detail to the atmosphere level, that way next year, right after this year's past, even if a customer comes to us without the data, they can still run inference, because we have the relationship the PDE that allows us to go and reconstruct what happens if so it's all PDE based.

S Speaker 215:12That makes a lot of sense. Few follow up questions again, so how do you choose verticals does that and is there, say, a data risk for you to sort of trying to fine tune your internal models based on some of these proprietary data sets? Great

S Speaker 115:31question. There's a strong pool to industries where resource rich, there's pressure to ship, and you're collecting a lot of data, because when there's pressure to ship, you have options to either wait for a simulation or build the real thing, and both results are going to come back to the same time as you end up building the real thing and collecting data. This ends up looking like two spaces. Consumer tech is a really strong pool, the big, big companies, and the second is Aerospace is a really strong pool. Yeah, I think we're being pulled more towards aerospace, other than this really exciting contract we have with Amazon, because in aerospace, your data is more rich, expressive and captures more complicated phenomenons now, so like, you can study cross domain interactions much easier, because the questions you ask often, like, involve like, multi physics, yeah. Now the problem is data privacy. This is what I'll say. We've had a lot of conversations about this, especially as we go through like contract structuring. Right data in AI is a concern when you can reconstruct the original inputs from the problem right when I if you train a language model on contract details, and you can prompt it in a way that reveals the original inputs, because that's what it was trained on. We don't need to keep your data. What we need to keep is the what we do keep is the fundamental relationship between parameters and physics, right, like how this material relates to structure, but it's one better than that. We store that we study it in the latent space of our model, so we in an abstract dimension that is not useful to anybody. Even if we gave it to you, you cannot reconstruct any meaning out of it, because we've it's not so simple as materials. This material, this proprietary material, relates to this structure in this way. No, it's It's in like a very abstract, obfuscated dimension that only we can reconstruct, and when we reconstruct it, it still is only in the relationship space and not in any of the original data space

S Speaker 217:27that rationally makes sense to me, and I totally agree, is the market also sort of giving you the same indications? You mentioned a lot of pull, I'm sure you have a lot of you're having a lot of conversations around them. Is the market sort of giving you the same indication, because parallely in the LLM domain chat GPD today, you cannot sort they with the data that some user would give them. They use that to train their models, and you cannot sort of get back to the same data source. But ever since the Samsung fiasco, when they launched some of their internal plans there and was public, I have seen a lot of enterprises being very wary of adopting solutions, sandbox environment. So is the market sort of treating you the same

But ever since the Samsung fiasco, when they launched some of their internal plans there and was public, I have seen a lot of enterprises being very wary of adopting solutions, sandbox environment. So is the market sort of treating you the same
that rationally makes sense to me, and I totally agree, is the market also sort of giving you the same indications? You mentioned a lot of pull, I'm sure you have a lot of you're having a lot of conversations around them. Is the market sort of giving you the same indication, because parallely in the LLM domain chat GPD today, you cannot sort they with the data that some user would give them.

S Speaker 118:11way? Surprisingly, yes, there is no alternative. It's not easy to build a physics model and your alternatives, you hire an entire machine learning engineering team. But I think I'll be honest with you, the indicators I have are that, like, the director of soft goods just texted me saying, like, yeah, let's get you under NDA, because the alternative is you hire, I guess, an entire mle, and you try to build up your own physics foundation model. And I mean, the technology we're using comes straight out of our lab and our director of research, and so it's but we're surprised too. But I think another thing here is a lot of the players that we are talking to also rationally understand physics and math in a way that makes it like the fact that we can explain to them it's a latent space representation means nothing. Actually, it's like, you know, a high dimensional representation of something that cannot reconstruct your original resonates in a way that I don't think maybe the average, yeah, I mean, it's that. And then I think the last proof point for us is most of the pool we've been getting is from data sensitive spaces, like aerospace, defense, very like government, even government spaces, right? So it's not our outreaches. They're inbound to us. Yeah,

S Speaker 219:27makes sense. Makes sense. Cinnamon, how does the product roadmap keep from here look like, let's say, a year from now, in terms of accuracy, in terms of the use cases currently being experimentation. But do you want to get into more production workflows or workflows in terms of how the UI would evolve? Have you given it a thought?

S Speaker 119:46Yeah, we have. The key thing for us is we don't want to just be a simulation replacement tool. I think we're the wrong company if you know, if you're looking to invest in like a ANSYS replacer, because the value really is in being able to model complex physics in a way that's physically accurate so that you can discover new physics. This is how we this is how we see it done in labs at Stanford. Right? You use these ml approaches to make sense of relationships in your data, and then take that and you make advancements in materials development anyway. What this what this means is, we first need to be able to get the relationships of that we know correctly before we can do anything in the spaces down. It looks like 10 customers at the conservative end of our pricing is 100 150k a year. Brings us to around like the one to 1.5 million arr. But the customers we pick, again, it's selective based on what we're able to learn so that we can link the four domains that we already have, like, that baseline physics model for which we already said the four domains, right? Um, there are, there's, there's sub 5% accurate or error benchmark is a target for the four domains in our baseline model. That's just we, I mean, we talked to 150 potential customers and ask them, like, just kind of like, iterated on what would be acceptable for them to test. That's how we set it. And also, we were engineers, so we know what we would trust. But really, like I said, it's more important to link those domains to cross cross physics learning by onboarding these customers and building the models. It's a self it's not a self serve product. This year, it's not, but next year will be, and it will have huge value.

S Speaker 121:51Yeah, we launched, like, last week, and then, yeah, we have a proof of concept with Amazon at the Intel inbound from Intel, Apple, Google. It looks like Apple based on the text preview I just saw. We're moving forward. Um, ESA, European Space Agency, is another customer at like the customers I've been spending the most time with, and truthfully, we launched, and then I started talking to people this week, so like investors this week for our phrase. So I haven't had a lot of time to sit with our customers, but the ones that we're prioritizing are the folks that already have the database available data. The contract value would be over a million a year to work with them. We'd be investing heavily in developing for them, but with the return on our end, um, what else do you think? Oh, I think this because we've been getting into the technical bits. This is the most exciting traction for me, personally, it's that on the tech end last night, because I've been pitching so much about, like, this is not a simulation tool. I just wanted to, I was talking about the roadmap. I just wanted to test something with our product. And so, you know, we think about relationships and the equations and data in our roadmap, we have this target of, well, we're going to be able to invert the model so that we can go from, let's say, instead of parameters equal performance, you want to target performance, you want to target, like, I want material, this conductivity, and we then flip the relationship and give you back the parameters, right? So we're like, how can we test this without needing an entire experimental,

23:17like lab bench? So we,
like lab bench? So we,
like lab bench? So we,
like lab bench? So we,
S Speaker 123:18we took our model and we trained it, changed, inverted a portion of it, and trained it on fluid flow data, and asked it to relate player and vision performance, what turned back to us was to 99% accuracy the Navier Stokes equation. That's huge, because it means that we were able to go from data to fundamental law of physics that was accurate, right? And so we started doing this. I mean, this was just last night, so we didn't sleep much, but we we're doing it with heat transfer. Now, we're excited to see where else, but I think it's in terms of us, where we're going. This is direction we're going. It's like you have a performance, you've got the data that should be expressive enough. Now, how do we tell you what to do with that, and what you can do with that? That's gives me chills. And so I got to think about what we do next with this, now that we can achieve this, and it's not actually 10 a year out, because I think it can be really exciting for some of these customers that we take.

S Speaker 224:10very interesting. Goes back to your point of physics, discovering new physics, and totally makes sense. I recently met a company which is in the area of AI building AI, how AI can orchestrate ml application. So totally understand the vision that that's a very exciting cinnamon.

And it's like, yeah, like, Um, yes, two mill out of 20 cap. We really just need to be able to hire them, software engineering support to take on these customers.

Is there? Can you? Can you? I know we have five minutes left, and I do have to run at 130 but can you sort of take me through a workflow for a semiconductor company. I would love to see if there's something internally at Qualcomm that we can do as a partnership.

Is there? Can you? Can you? I know we have five minutes left, and I do have to run at 130 but can you sort of take me through a workflow for a semiconductor company. I would love to see if there's something internally at Qualcomm that we can do as a partnership.

We can, we can layer that on top of the methods that we already have, in order for you to quickly be able to ask questions and get insights back. So we can run up any simulation software you have it, it just depends on, like, what, what needs you haven't went, what asks you have
