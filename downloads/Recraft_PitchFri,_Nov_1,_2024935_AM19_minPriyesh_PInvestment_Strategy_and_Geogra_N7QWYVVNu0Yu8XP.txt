S Speaker 10:00In chips every year, and then. So we invest in companies that are pushing the boundaries into Newton connectivity in each one of these. So a lot of like so we're currently investing in several applications of AI. So we've made several investments across AI, in company, in the infrastructure, in companies like COVID, waste and weight supply, season, scale and profit and a bunch of others. And then we're now investing more in companies that are building applications across AI. So that's the 10,000 foot view we invest. We invest off a balance sheet. So it's one $50 million every year across the globe. We do have,

S Speaker 10:56We have six, six regions across the globe, and we invest in Europe. It's one of those regions. We actually have one person in London as well. And yeah, I mean, our check says are up to 10 million initial check size, so anywhere from two to 10. Activity tends to be five to seven. And so

S Speaker 28:16have just checked on that. Nobody is able to that. And we also produce, we also produce, we have a bunch of tools for image integration, again, very important for design. Can do and get there from the first time you need to be trained, you need to do things like in painting, razor. So there's only some tools.

S Speaker 212:44of 2023 we launched first in May after that, here in January, we have launched. Here we have launched our own foundation model, and that capitalized the growth so that the growth is organic, because we have launched our own foundation model that is much better quality than things that are open source, and because we have this unique functionality that I mentioned, like style control or vector arteries,

S Speaker 213:22We have to the three tiers of pricing. Pricing is basically similar competition. We didn't optimize pricing yet at all. We just, we just have repeated whatever everyone else has done. We would plan to invest into this. We only ship to some months ago and last month was fully It was everything about everything about the world. So we were not optimizing miniaturization. We plan to do we plan to do so, so conversions will be higher. But as of now, it's just not optimized. We will

S Speaker 114:01will be a tool that you come will have an enterprise grade product as well. We are, we do have enterprise
will be a tool that you come will have an enterprise grade product as well. We are, we do have enterprise
will be a tool that you come will have an enterprise grade product as well. We are, we do have enterprise
will be a tool that you come will have an enterprise grade product as well. We are, we do have enterprise
S Speaker 214:10grade product. We are passing SOC two right now because enterprises that we are talking to, they are already buying so prosumer. By prosumer, I mean that it's like professional tool. We are building, not only for individual designers, we are also building for teams. That product that we have is already equal energy because they sell it piece of the product. You can have several courses on Canvas commands work together on canvas, which is needed if you're working in a team. And for enterprises we have, we are building up the functionality that is needed there. It should be. It should be shortly, there is a bunch of requests from larger companies that they would use to craft inside So,

14:52keeping or maybe Okay, so
keeping or maybe Okay, so
keeping or maybe Okay, so
keeping or maybe Okay, so
S Speaker 214:53the next slide is what partnerships. We shipped new model on Wednesday, and since Wednesday, we already are investigators have already been already there, but together, AI, we probably will be there like tomorrow, maybe. So they also actively working on Alias. There's also requests from large companies to work with us, and we'll see where it goes. I don't know exactly, two days, but it's we'll see. I don't know. Hopefully, my plan is
the next slide is what partnerships.

S Speaker 115:20these images, which is their copyright, like, you know, like, for example, a lot of these brands they will like.

S Speaker 215:31or so right now your rights are, it is hard to copyright and generate images, to generate, to copyright and generate image we there are some rules. So at one point you can copyright like a character. So we plan to add something in the tool. Probably we have company that we might be working with, I will see that says that, okay, right now you can copyright this image. It like checks the image and it says, Okay, right now you can copyright it. Will definitely add this. Some enterprises are interested in doing so, especially companies like like Disney, or companies which really need to copyright the results. Basically, you need to prove that the character doesn't belong to any to anything. So it's like it's not copyrighted yet, and also that you have put enough human work into this. There are no global standards right now. There's no fixed regulation right now, but it will be developed during probably next maybe couple of years. How you how you copyright, it will definitely be following what is happening there, and including in the tool everything else of the regulation comes up with, I hope we will also be able to
or so right now your rights are, it is hard to copyright and generate images, to generate, to copyright and generate image we there are some rules. So at one point you can copyright like a character.

How you how you copyright, it will definitely be following what is happening there, and including in the tool everything else of the regulation comes up with, I hope we will also be able to
or so right now your rights are, it is hard to copyright and generate images, to generate, to copyright and generate image we there are some rules. So at one point you can copyright like a character.

16:41Yeah, I agree. Yeah. Okay.
Yeah, I agree. Yeah. Okay.
Yeah, I agree. Yeah. Okay.
Yeah, I agree. Yeah. Okay.
S Speaker 216:59there is a bunch of stuff we want to do with the model. There's several things, several large pieces in terms of control. There's unique things that we want to ship. We know how to build them. So it's basically the question of delivery. And we also want to do some things on marketing. So that's the brand is about, no. And so people know whether it's this particular company, and that is the place, the first destination for designers. So we there's a plan how we improve during the next year. So according to this one, that we have to contribute a 10 million IRR by the end of December. And if the goal is exactly as we predict, those are the costs it might, it might like vary it a little bit, and there will be some changes in cloud costs, specifically in different schools for training. I do very well understand how much money you need for 10 understand how much money you

17:44need, then raise more middle next year.
need, then raise more middle next year.
need, then raise more middle next year.
need, then raise more middle next year.
S Speaker 217:46I just exactly so that is like the minimum that I need now. I don't want to really want to raise more.
I just exactly so that is like the minimum that I need now. I don't want to really want to raise more.
I just exactly so that is like the minimum that I need now. I don't want to really want to raise more.
I just exactly so that is like the minimum that I need now. I don't want to really want to raise more.

S Speaker 218:21introduction to your team. That sounds, sounds great. I'm looking forward for getting the email. I'm happy to meet you personally. I really think that it's important, when you are getting your partners on board with with the team. It's important to to see each other in person. So it should be great media.
