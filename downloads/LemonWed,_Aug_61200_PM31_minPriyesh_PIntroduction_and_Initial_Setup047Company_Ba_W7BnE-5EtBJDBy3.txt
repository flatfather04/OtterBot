S Speaker 21:57Right, right then it's so very interesting. I got the intro and a very interesting space that you're building in. Of course, it's highly relevant for us as well, because we have a lot of play across wearables. IoT, you mentioned Fitbit earlier. So of course, an area that we look at. But how long have you been at it? When? When was the company founded?

2:23Oh, okay, interesting.
Oh, okay, interesting.
Oh, okay, interesting.
Oh, okay, interesting.
S Speaker 12:27And starting six weeks ago, more directly, we started to get a bunch of angel investors from open AI meta and Google, right? Yeah. Now we're raising of Christians, right? But we're raising like, $2.5 million which, you know, I would imagine is maybe, maybe she knows, for you, I don't know, also determine, but we risk $2.5 million that's what we need to get to the next stage. My co founder had proved four weeks ago, and now we have a prototype, and we are going to launch a product by the end of September, a third version of product, not a great one. I say just because we really want to get more data, literally fast. Yet breaks the bank is sponsoring for us a billboard on Time Square on October 6. Fernanda give us a nice deadline that we need to last over, right?

S Speaker 13:24breaks is not the best. Yeah, it's constantly for us, a billboard on transfer.

breaks is not the best. Yeah, it's constantly for us, a billboard on transfer.
S Speaker 16:38Like we are open to have a bit more capital, you know. So I always say to produce 2.5 and four millions, the minimum that when you need to get the most, you know, then you get it faster. Yeah. But you don't need to over raise more than that otherwise, you know, you just see valuation at least for the next few last questions.

S Speaker 27:02Totally. I understand you don't want to dilute so much so early, and especially if you have some of those milestones coming up, the valuation will quickly rise down the line. So it makes sense. I understand that. Yes, Dennis would love to sort of pass it over to you learn more about what you're planning to build. How do you see this happening? Yeah, okay. Yeah,

S Speaker 17:24zero to one consumer play. I've done it many, many times, you know, like I launched the Gemini, the app, you know, from zero to 20 mine, I was leading personalization for Gemini. So how do you personalize the experience, you know, on the AI, once you have millions of data points for other users and data sources and the each data sources have different priority and format, you know. And I tell you that because we were researching and learning the best practice as we went along, you know. And then we should, maybe you saw some announcement like, oh, Gemini can personalize based on research, but he's very, very relevant to what we do now, right? I mean, you saw the results, right? So you know that means to the space, and then we listen to the signal of the users, right? Like reformation for them. So that's, that's very relevant. Before that, I was living with consumer health in Madurai, so we're doing like one more pharmaceuticals. We had a device that was able to see how you breathing at night, and based on that, you can use and we were also launching on the smart watches. And I launched a program I called habit formation. How do we change the habit for users, for them to actually achieve their health? And that's really what studies and that's what led me to really understand, is consumer health market plans to get and I think most importantly, the consumer needs space, and we are going to talk about that later on, about this opportunity. Prior to that, I actually took a break from Google when I bootstrapped a company. Again, I launched a marketplace from zero to one, and I sold it to the co founder, CEO of Bigcommerce. You know, big promise, even it was started covid And Eden was just chairman at that point. And then, you like, what you started. For me, that was a good way to move from San Francisco, where I had spent the last seven years of my life, to Switzerland, where I spent the last four years before going to New York. I before that, I was also then I launched the Google Assistant point 02, users. I was part of the funding team. You know, again, customer for the vertical surface. You know, we had so so many launches, but that's when I met my portfolio. And my portfolio is a PhD in computer science. He was leading 50 people, and then for the last year, he decided to go back as an IC to write and deploy the AI agent without fixing the code base of Google. Saw some news ended last year. Oh, 25% usually is no written like AI. There's like, genius, like him, that's a contributor. And what's very interesting is, like, the AI, objective system that is put into place, like, continuously monitors like potential errors and go to fix them, etc, that's that's really upgrading, like, the architecture is very similar to what we are doing now for problems. So we found more similarities than what we expected. That's very nice. Prior to Google. I mean, I was researching prior to Google, I was even launched an E commerce platform for the biggest retailer in central and touching Zero to One again, right? Yeah. So that's kind of my experience, you can see, and before that, you know, maybe I was younger, I was even like launching startup when I was doing my university. So that's, that's,
zero to one consumer play. I've done it many, many times, you know, like I launched the Gemini, the app, you know, from zero to 20 mine, I was leading personalization for Gemini.

that's that makes what we are doing today.

So I think that's, that's a bottom pipeline on
S Speaker 215:01Yeah, that is makes a lot of sense. I totally get the broader vision here. There will be a lot of like, a few follow up questions here. So why do you think people would have a specific external app to manage data across? Essentially, you are an orchestration layer on top of a lot of these data sources, and you're building agentic systems on top of it. But do you feel there will be another app, like lemon to sort of organize all of this data together? Or do you think this will be an internal effort that a Google Health, something that an Android or an apple will own?

15:39Yeah, I think, you know, like
Yeah, I think, you know, like
Yeah, I think, you know, like
Yeah, I think, you know, like
S Speaker 115:42no in the competition landscape, actually, I only worry about the new equipments, because I really think the current players are not able to put that into this. There is, like, different reason one, if you think about the striker people, okay, the trackers, there's a new matrix. They have a very, very hard time to refill the product on a higher level of

S Speaker 116:09Dennis field, is not going to be where you envision today, and the reason is because they focus on metrics. If you move 10,000 steps away from the main screen, you know, people go crazy, and very hard time to meeting the product at that level. Also, you know, the percentage of the population they have is very, very small for even tracker, right, especially worldwide. And so they only address these people who have their trackers and and I think, very equivalent that will actually have, like the case learning that the more users you have, and then, you know, what's the right outcome for them, then get the better data you get. But also you want to be on the same app that your friends are on, you know, because we're very inspired by building going to be and the accountability system, you know, Duolingo is doing a good job like that to force people to learn, to do something hard, which is to learn languages. And I think we have a different creations for that. And you know, at some point you want to be on the one that your friend is also, if you take a software across all of them and see the trackers as, let's say, partners, as opposed to competitors, is the way to Smith. Now, you were asking about the Android kind of, maybe OS kind of play, right? Yeah, I think that's a good question. But what we've seen so far is, you know, I think in order to sustain the ecosystem around them. You know, they do want to create this natural part that change your data. Of course, after the app, as opposed to actually being the active players in there, you look at address, Apple in terms of, like, AI, you know, I mean, first they relate. The buyers were biased. But, you know, I think
Dennis field, is not going to be where you envision today, and the reason is because they focus on metrics. If you move 10,000 steps away from the main screen, you know, people go crazy, and very hard time to meeting the product at that level. Also, you know, the percentage of the population they have is very, very small for even tracker, right, especially worldwide. And so they only address these people who have their trackers and and I think, very equivalent that will actually have, like the case learning that the more users you have, and then, you know, what's the right outcome for them, then get the better data you get. But also you want to be on the same app that your friends are on, you know, because we're very inspired by building going to be and the accountability system, you know, Duolingo is doing a good job like that to force people to learn, to do something hard, which is to learn languages. And I think we have a different creations for that. And you know, at some point you want to be on the one that your friend is also, if you take a software across all of them and see the trackers as, let's say, partners, as opposed to competitors, is the way to Smith. Now, you were asking about the Android kind of, maybe OS kind of play, right? Yeah, I think that's a good question. But what we've seen so far is, you know, I think in order to sustain the ecosystem around them. You know, they do want to create this natural part that change your data. Of course, after the app, as opposed to actually being the active players in there, you look at address, Apple in terms of, like, AI, you know, I mean, first they relate. The buyers were biased.

S Speaker 118:54people the first people to know about us in a way that is completely different, and what is others you know, is, let's first maybe understand the mood of ICT, because then I'm going to tell you how I want someone to learn about this. Like, you know, the consumer headspace. You have 35% of the players. We call them the adapters. They add up the food or the movement they need to actually achieve the goals. They're very proactive without using a tracker device. People who have trackers go to classes, and they tend to be healthy, and they do sport, they want to go into the optimization. But then you have, on the other side, you have 35% of people the company reactive is healthy. So either because they deny all about their health, so they don't do anything, or because their health is because of their life, so it's not that old, so they don't know anything. So instead of loss course, but you got this big group in the middle. You call them the evaluators. They have a few points too much, they don't sleep properly, or they have too much stress at all, and they keep evaluating, I'm going to study style for that race, or I'm going to change my bedtime routine, you know? But you as a friend of them, you know, they're just like saying feeling about it, but they're not going to do it. Yeah, they're missing this extra kick to actually take action. So no target customer that we start with. No. They have been very ignored. Because people go for the most active users out there in terms of the understanding, very ignored. And they are right in the middle of everyone, you know, and because on the Alexa is a completely reactive people. So this one, you see them at the hospital, and one, you see them at the hospital after then I want you as a friend of them you probably have seen like that, you know, you just tell you know, it's bullshit. I know you may need to do it. Just get this pet company and it's going to have to tell you at the right time lunch list, what to do. So you don't even have to change the buttons, you know, describe things where there's been duplicate.

S Speaker 121:00Yeah. I mean, we are going to start with having, like, honesty system that you set up bring your data. You know, we might not have all of the sources yet, but then it's going to be able to recommend you across all the pillars of awareness, you know, like, movement, nutrition, sleep, mother, well being, Woman's Health. I'm not sure we can get to that point yet, but concern we will add in the future, and maybe, like some management as an interesting and you know this all these pillars is what should be always covering across all of these pillars. Because, you know, as a user, they want to have one app to cover all of the awareness. When they say, if you want to have more energy, what is it food? Is it? Is it movement? Is it to touch it. So that's what you want to touch, yeah? I mean, I can, I don't know. I have too many. So, I mean, we have so many. So I can show you a quick marks of how the Greens look back. It's interesting. Yeah,

Dennis, yes, strategically speaking, it's it's a strong fit for us, where I have a little bit concerned right now, or just from a thesis perspective, where I feel is it may be us around early for us, typically, within the team, we when we have a strong team building something which is highly relevant. In your case, you you have a stellar founding team, and you're building something highly relevant. That makes a lot of sense, but we like to see a little bit of traction, a little bit of sort of adoption, and some signals that this is going ahead in the market, so that where I feel being a pre product sort of stage is slightly around early, but I would love to have a chat with the team, maybe if, and maybe also float some discussion internally around business units and see if there is some fields there, and possibly take it forward from that angle.
