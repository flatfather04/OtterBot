============================================================

S Speaker 10:00I'm going to just say very quick. Welcome to all of you. Welcome to preview day for batch 35 as Leonard kind of mentioned, preview day is actually a long standing tradition for 500 with the flagship accelerator. So it started, obviously from the days of your like, 14 years ago, where we have the main Demo Day event. But obviously it's nice to get friendlies and, like mentors, other portfolio founders, investors that are just friends and and obviously alumni to come watch the batch founders. It's really a great chance to just get, like, kind of the nerves out and dress rehearsal. I think there's oftentimes a big change from preview day to the actual demo day. So so be kind, and it's really, you know, a lot, a lot more a chance for the companies to make sure that their narrative and their pitch is ready. But it's also nice to just gather everybody here. I think there's various everyone here has some various touch point with, with 500 from various alumni, or just or CO investors, alumni we've invested in, and people who actually have worked with this badge. And I think it's always it's such a great audience, I think so we have 16 companies. I won't go into too much about them. Clayton will give you a little bit of a preview. And then, of course, you'll see them honestly. Them on stage yourself. Last thing is, I think you know, we have been, some of you have been to this office before, but I'm assuming many people have maybe only been here for the first time, but a little bit of the history of kind of where 500 has been, location wise, in the Bay Area, especially for those who are outside of Silicon Valley and are just here temporarily or for its visit. So our very first headquarters was actually a little further away down this, not down the street, like 20 minutes without traffic on 101 in Mountain View, downtown Mountain View. And that was very intentional at the time 2010 era. We wanted to be close to Google and LinkedIn and even Microsoft, which wasn't as cool back then. Unfortunately, I vividly remember working with the Microsoft team and Azure was kind of a new thing, and a lot of our startups are like, I don't want to use that right, but it's obviously very different now. But that was a very intentional location, close to Caltrain, close to those big tech companies. Then gradually, over the years, our headquarters kind of moved into San Francisco, which was also becoming like very much the center of gravity for tax startups. And then the pandemic hit, and then nobody had an office. We had to. We very abruptly closed that office and went virtual and remote for a while, which was certainly a huge adjustment for the batch. As a team, 500 has always been very distributed and global beginning. So still an adjustment. But in many ways, like as great founders, scrappy, you just make things work. And now here we are in 2024 and I, you know, maybe controversial hot take from me, San Francisco's always going to be the city, but not quite as much of the like you need to absolutely be there as we've seen both in the Bay Area and many companies trying to head out of the Bay Area globally, of course. So we are here now in downtown Palo Alto, which is still very conveniently located close to Caltrain, I think, a little cleaner and safer. So anyways, so I'm almost native to Bay area, so I can, I'll see what I want. But anyways, so that is a little bit of the 500 history again. So many of you, I see a lot of familiar faces, a lot of new faces. Just welcome. Thank you so much for supporting our companies. I think we have a lot of opportunity afterwards for you to go talk with them, hear a little bit more. If what they said interested, you go and talk to them, and hopefully anyone who's interested in getting to know them better, writing a chat. But all in all, just a great chance to meet some really amazing, talented founders. You don't hear a lot of the blood, sweat and tears that goes on beyond you know, behind the scenes every day, all night, aside from what you see on the two minutes when they're on stage. So I think any of you who have been founders really can appreciate that. So welcome again. Without further ado, I will hand it over to Clayton. You.

S Speaker 39:19as I want to introduce the founders. We have two orders of business. So last two admin things. The first is, there will be a QR code, drum roll, please. There we go. If you scan this, you will get a form that allows you to give feedback to the founders. How did they do? What did you like? And you're good, you're good at market strategy. Wasn't convincing or very interesting. I'd love to me, I don't know if you can write checks through that, but if you can, you please use crypto. That's our preferred form of funding here. And then the second form which will be sent to the VC unlocked team is a survey to pick the top four companies that they want to take tomorrow to the Investment Committee simulation. So if you're part of BC unlocked, keep that in mind as you rank. You're not part of VC unlocked. Apply to the next cohort. It's a lot of fun, very informative. I mean, you meet some fantastic people. So I think that being said, I have the green light to actually call up companies. Yeah, all right, let's do this. Perfect. So leaving this off, straight from Hong Kong here to disrupt the fashion industry. Assembly, CEO of make the dot

15:31Raise your hand if you love inventory management.
S Speaker 615:36Almost no one. That's exactly how 5 million businesses in the United States field, and yet they spend 1/3 of their time managing their inventory. Inventory is not sexy, but it's the backbone of every business like this one Cameron Diaz's brand, who we signed as a customer after three meetings. This week, Avalon sells 23 different wines and bundled products in 10 different sales channels, and it takes their team 50 hours of manual data entry to manage it. They have no way to scale their operations without having to hire more people because their data is siloed across every sales channel. Spreadsheet and accounting software that they use, brands like Avalon are forced to either spend a lot of money for legacy systems that are a nightmare, or they use dozens of spreadsheets that become unbearable as you scale. To bridge this gap, we created Kaizen trade. Our software automates inventory workflows, streamlines sales channels and provides businesses with a complete overview of their entire operations, so that companies like this can be more profitable, and it's not just wine, it's packaged food, it's skincare products, candles, soap and even plants. We launched our beta two months ago. This morning, we were at $22,000 in annual recurring revenue, and as of one hour ago, we're now at 26,000 in annual recurring revenue growing so fast at 50% week over week, and we only launched. We only wrote our first line of code at the beginning of June. So this has all been happening very quickly. My co founder and I have five years of experience working together. We started out by consulting manufacturers, and have faced this problem firsthand among hundreds of businesses, and there are 30 million businesses around the world making and selling their own products, which represents a $50 billion opportunity. And for us, inventory management is just the beginning. So to recap, we're at 26,000 not 20 are already wrong. 26,000 in annual recurring revenue, growing 50% week over week. My name is Marcus. If any of this resonated with you, come and enjoy some of Cameron Diaz's wine with us after this very, very

S Speaker 821:58Companies major software project today by asking engineer to update their status in project management tools by time consuming and require lots of manual work. However, they hire a very expensive project manager whose whole job is to update the status and communication of everything across teams. Despite that, 70% of a software project still meets their deadline, leading to budget overall and based opportunities, it added 30% of the total cost. We have a company to deliver project 40% faster on time. Hi Andrea Bing, co founder and CEO of the media nd AI, project assistant for the team, it comes into your data. Have a full picture of your project so you can create task update project status and provide real time insight. Engineer no longer wasted their time in manually update, getting the right information they always need to build. We are working with design partners such as mbmb and styers to polish our data. The team conversion market is valued at 40 billion. The problem effect of large company and smaller teams. I have with west of assets. My co founder was a ticket leader at mbnb. We both know how crucial and challenging it is to maintain high performance alignment across things. This is why we are creating this tool. We always need it if you are interested in learning more.

S Speaker 924:03STEM. Education is failing in the US. We spend so much money every year on education, but we're ranked 16th in science. Why is that? We're still learning from textbooks in 2024 students are not engaged with 10k science. Students are immersed in the world of science data. It's highly engaging. They learn in 3d on the web or in VR. We're measuring learning with AI on our proprietary dashboard for teachers. I'm Laura Lin, CEO, founder of 10k science I have 20 years experience in biomedical visualization. My last product was so good it was featured in an iPad commercial, but ultimately our content production pipeline was too manual. It was too time consuming to make all the content so I switched to automating our production pipeline, making it easy to turn science data into science content. I'm joined by Jack our CTO. He built out the data teams at both Pandora and visco Liz, our head of content is a scientist. Works with 3d data. She brings with her a cohort of other scientists from leading institutions. We've demonstrated that scientists will make content on our platform for free. We're partnered with Lawrence Hall of Science. They vet all of our content Lawrence Hall they're the creators of a curriculum that is used by over 40% of students in the US. Our content pipeline is growing at an ever increasing rate. More content leads to more engagement. It leads to an easier pilot selling. So we have two paid ongoing pilots right now at fantastic schools. We've got five more in the pipeline, very promising, and we are in exciting talks with Carolina biologic. They sell science kits to practically every school in the US. This is like a cheat code for getting into schools. We also the NIH knows that we will move the needle on science education, and they've awarded us two years of funding for product development. This is 10k science. Come join us for a demo. We're right over there. Do
