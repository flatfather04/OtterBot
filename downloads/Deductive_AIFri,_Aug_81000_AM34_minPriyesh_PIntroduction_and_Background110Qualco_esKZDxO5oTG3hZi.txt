S Speaker 11:26I can, I can imagine, and it's like the earliest stages, of course, you know, and with the way the space is evolving, I was just looking back at the chat history, you know, like the first time you connected was almost at one of these events, right? It's almost a year ago, right? So many things happen, like,

S Speaker 35:31ahead. Thanks. Deepak And Sameer, pleasure to meet you. I'm a senior associate here in the team with been with the firm for about a little more than a year now, originally from India. Did my undergrad there, have spent a lot of time with early stage startups back there, and then been in venture for about three years. Spent some time with Menlo Ventures and Morphe ventures in

S Speaker 25:51a day. Gotcha. Very cool. Yeah, maybe I can go next. So, yeah, was basically born and brought up in Delhi, kind of like, was around, like, basically because my dad had, like, a common job. Oh, nice, very nice.

S Speaker 26:09So and then, like, did my undergrad from IIT Guwahati in the US, for a PhD, went to UC Berkeley, did my PhD in databases, where I had the fortune Academy, work with ion striker and Michael Jordan, unlike at the intersection of like databases and AI. So I worked on something called blinkdb. The idea was that can have approximate queries with like statistical bounds on extremely large amounts of data. That's quick, right, like, I mean, as opposed to exact queries, which might take a long, long time. So that had, like, a lot of like applications and observability and kind of like feature engineering and a lot of like these things, right? Because, like, I mean, a lot of like, our world works on approximations, and you don't after kind of like basic Oh, and one fun fact is, like, Qualcomm actually funded a large part of my PhD. I was like, one of the, yeah, this

S Speaker 27:09So, but yeah, I mean, essentially, actually, like, this was like a fellowship program, I guess you guys still run it, but like, we had, like, basically a lot of like presentations at Qualcomm headquarters, like in San Diego. So we used to do a lot of

S Speaker 17:25very nice when and when was this? Samir, when did you complete your PhD?
very nice when and when was this? Samir, when did you complete your PhD?
very nice when and when was this? Samir, when did you complete your PhD?
very nice when and when was this? Samir, when did you complete your PhD?
S Speaker 27:28So I completed my PhD in 2014 and I believe I was a fellow, or I received the Qualcomm fellowship in 12, if I

S Speaker 27:43First of all, my PhD was kind of like funded by Qualcomm, and then the second half was from Facebook.

7:49Oh, wow. Very nice. Okay,
Oh, wow. Very nice. Okay,
Oh, wow. Very nice. Okay,
Oh, wow. Very nice. Okay,
S Speaker 27:52after, like, essentially, Berkeley, you all started a company, as you know, like Databricks. Joined Databricks as the seventh engineer had, like, a great run there, led the Apache Spark team. So a lot of my background being kind of like basically evolved into deep databases, the query optimizers, the eval the runtimes and things like after that. Like, I mean, basically, like a few years later, like four or five years later, I went to, kind of like, basically Facebook to do AI. And that's kind of like, basically, in retrospect, was not a great idea. But I was not a great idea, but database was a very kind of, like database company. So I went to essentially collaborate with, like, Facebook, AI research and things like, just to kind of like, learn that word run there as well. Like, essentially, five years spent there was responsible for all of the compute layer for, like, simply the entire machine learning and analytics stack at Facebook. So that was kind of like my role led a team of, like, about 6070 people back in the days, and then, and then becoming effectively started, kind of like seeing two things right, which was kind of like, basically a very kind of like defining trend. Obviously, part of my move, like to Facebook was motivated by this kind of like whole idea around like Transformers. And the way that I actually looked at Transformers was a little different from like, what actually turned out to be actually definitely chat, GPT and all these kind of things have kind of like, really blown up. But I basically looked at it like from kind of perspective of code. So the idea here is that they can see, obviously, you can create, like, your best and the badass model on all the data on the internet, but you can also pay your best and the badass models on, like, essentially all the code that is, right? And unlike the internet data, code is infinite, right? It has a very, like, well defined structure, very low entropy. So you can actually basically, really get better and better with, like, a transformer, like, playing out right exactly. So that was kind of, like basically part of the motivation. But like at Facebook, like, I mean, really had the great kind of like opportunity to work and kind of like collaborate on, like, essentially the pre, pre, kind of like llama versions, Codex and a bunch of like these kind of like tools along the way, roughly speaking, like, I mean, towards the kind of like yields of 2022 23 some of these epic ideas started shaping up. Like, essentially that the whole kind of like idea of, I mean, there is a product angle to it, and then there is, like, essentially the kind of like technical angle to it, right? Like, so technical definitely, like, basically motivated by this kind, like, essentially, whole idea that, like, hey, like, as a community, as, like, basically the industry, our ability to understand general purpose code, right, is kind of like, going to skyrocket, right? And that was evident, right? I mean, yeah, research was kind of like shaping up, and it was just a matter of time before, like, basically, like, smart people, like you put money on this problem. And, like, essentially, people actually built, like, the best of the baddest, best and the baddest models to, kind of like, actually do better than better code understanding. So that kind of like was very clear. And the second thing was, like, I mean, what we also realized that this is a huge step right. Like, I mean, essentially, this whole idea of services as software was kind of like Final we all have basically grew up in India, like, and we have seen, like, essentially, how services industry is, like, one of the biggest Right. Like, if you look at the Databricks and snowflakes of the world, like, they have, like, basically three, 4 billion of revenue, right? If you look at the kind of, like three services, that's like 18 to 20 billion, right? And you can effectively grow at a much faster rate. Definitely, the margins are much, much lower, because it's a very human setting industry, right? Like, so we wanted to, kind of, like, actually tackle that problem general. Like, I mean, basically so, so that's kind of like, essentially where we were, and, like, being effectively, like, in terms of, like, software like, there is a software creation problem and there is a software maintenance problem, and we found a huge opportunity in, kind of like, basically the latter thing, and
after, like, essentially, Berkeley, you all started a company, as you know, like Databricks. Joined Databricks as the seventh engineer had, like, a great run there, led the Apache Spark team. So a lot of my background being kind of like basically evolved into deep databases, the query optimizers, the eval the runtimes and things like after that.

then you can, kind of like, really grow
then you can, kind of like, really grow
then you can, kind of like, really grow
S Speaker 212:042023 roughly, right? So, roughly, yeah, I mean, essentially, I was still at Facebook, like, I mean, you just kind of like talking to a lot of people, because, again, like, yeah, like, this was we had a solution, but, like, we had no idea about, like, a product or a problem or even kind of like, so, yeah, spent a lot of time kind of like just talking to people, like, having kind of like chats, like, I mean, just kind of like talking to a potential customer base started to have, like form, but good thesis around this, like, initially, in like, April, March of 2023, reached out to, like, I mean, all the kind of like, basically good people on their network, like, essentially pitch. We were very thankful to get, like, essentially seven, eight, like term sheets, like, within a week, basically picked an investor. Like, I kind of, like, basically left Facebook on June 1 of 2023 we incorporated the company on June 2. Like, we basically raised, like, about seven and a half million dollars good angels and investors, and since then, like, I mean, our team is like 10 people, because reinforcement learning right? Like, we're not actually really gonna think grown that team and we are right, kind of like basically at a phase where we are post revenue, so we our product is kind of like basically working
2023 roughly, right? So, roughly, yeah, I mean, essentially, I was still at Facebook, like, I mean, you just kind of like talking to a lot of people, because, again, like, yeah, like, this was we had a solution, but, like, we had no idea about, like, a product or a problem or even kind of like, so, yeah, spent a lot of time kind of like just talking to people, like, having kind of like chats, like, I mean, just kind of like talking to a potential customer base started to have, like form, but good thesis around this, like, initially, in like, April, March of 2023, reached out to, like, I mean, all the kind of like, basically good people on their network, like, essentially pitch. We were very thankful to get, like, essentially seven, eight, like term sheets, like, within a week, basically picked an investor. Like, I kind of, like, basically left Facebook on June 1 of 2023 we incorporated the company on June 2. Like, we basically raised, like, about seven and a half million dollars good angels and investors, and since then, like, I mean, our team is like 10 people, because reinforcement learning right? Like, we're not actually really gonna think grown that team and we are right, kind of like basically at a phase where we are post revenue, so we our product is kind of like basically working
2023 roughly, right? So, roughly, yeah, I mean, essentially, I was still at Facebook, like, I mean, you just kind of like talking to a lot of people, because, again, like, yeah, like, this was we had a solution, but, like, we had no idea about, like, a product or a problem or even kind of like, so, yeah, spent a lot of time kind of like just talking to people, like, having kind of like chats, like, I mean, just kind of like talking to a potential customer base started to have, like form, but good thesis around this, like, initially, in like, April, March of 2023, reached out to, like, I mean, all the kind of like, basically good people on their network, like, essentially pitch.

Like, we're not actually really gonna think grown that team and we are right, kind of like basically at a phase where we are post revenue, so we our product is kind of like basically working
13:12across, like, Oh, that's awesome. That's a big milestone.
across, like, Oh, that's awesome. That's a big milestone.
across, like, Oh, that's awesome. That's a big milestone.
across, like, Oh, that's awesome. That's a big milestone.
S Speaker 213:16It is very humbling. And, yeah, so, and this was kind of like basically one of our kind of like philosophy as well. It's like keeping the company super lean until kind of like a sizable revenue and like product market fit, and then kind of expanding
It is very humbling. And, yeah, so, and this was kind of like basically one of our kind of like philosophy as well. It's like keeping the company super lean until kind of like a sizable revenue and like product market fit, and then kind of expanding
It is very humbling. And, yeah, so, and this was kind of like basically one of our kind of like philosophy as well. It's like keeping the company super lean until kind of like a sizable revenue and like product market fit, and then kind of expanding
It is very humbling. And, yeah, so, and this was kind of like basically one of our kind of like philosophy as well. It's like keeping the company super lean until kind of like a sizable revenue and like product market fit, and then kind of expanding
S Speaker 214:12so, so I think, like, overall, there are two kind of, like parts of this coin, right? Like, one is, like, basically the product question, right? Like, what are we building, right? And, and different people, kind of like, basically, are tackling this problem from like, different perspectives, like, at the end of the day, like, I mean, essentially deductive as a company, we are kind of like basically building a reliability layer for any software that's kind of like basically being written right. Like, so what we are just saying is that, hey, you can kind of like, basically write software which is a one time thing, and obviously, like, if you kind of like, actually can build and expand the software, but like, the major amount of time that, like all engineers spent on is in maintaining that software, right? Obviously, this is kind of like the pre white coding era, like with white coating, right? Of course, of course. So the main idea behind deductive, like, essentially as a platform, is that, like, we are, like, effectively, for lack of a better word, like simply a unified uptime platform, right? Like we are basically, when we, kind of like, go to our customers, we say that, like, hey, deductive is going to be that layer which is going to basically make sure that your service has three lines, five nines, six nines of availability, essentially for whatever you kind of like, basically wanted to do. Now, looking at that availability, there are kind of like, two aspects to that availability, right? That is the reactive, kind of like, basically aspect of it, like, where, like, those issues are happening, and you want, like, something kind of like, basically quickly root cause, and kind of like investigate those issues, and then you kind of like, actually go and fix this problem. And the other aspect of this is, like, proactive, right? I mean, you prevent the issues happening, and then public apps and all these things, like, in terms of this is kind of like, basically the area that we are going in, this is the vision that we are selling to our customers. This is kind of like, basically what we are building now on the technical side of things, right, like, and the actual kind of ground reality, our first focus, like, for the last like, I mean, basically one, one and a half year, and it will also remain for the Yeah, it's going to be kind of like in the reactive space, so a bunch of like, competition as well. Because, like, I mean, what is reactive space, right? Any incident happens, right? Like, I mean,
so, so I think, like, overall, there are two kind of, like parts of this coin, right? Like, one is, like, basically the product question, right? Like, what are we building, right?

16:12so what do you do? What do you love for that?
so what do you do? What do you love for that?
so what do you do? What do you love for that?
so what do you do? What do you love for that?
S Speaker 216:15Right? You're kind of, like, basically a goal. And a lot of people kind of, like, basically speak in like, different terms, but at the end of the day, everybody's goal is to kind of like, actually maintain like, a given level of uptime, right? Your service should actually be up for like, 99.99% of the time. Now, obviously that kind of, like, simply translates into, like, basically more than like, proxy metrics around, like npdr and like, a bunch of like mistakes, right? Like, so different people speak different terms, but at the end of the day, they care about, like, a given, kind of, like, SLE or a liability, of, like, essentially the set of services that they like, actually have. And that's kind of like the business, which deductive, is it, right? So that's kind of
Right? You're kind of, like, basically a goal.

And that's kind of like the business, which deductive, is it, right? So that's kind of
S Speaker 116:52like, but that's today, right? So, man, what? What is doing that part, which is reactive, right? Like bubbling up, you know incidents and the root causes, right? And what to do after that is today, but you you're saying the proactive approach, which is even when you know incidents about to happen, just giving a signal that, hey, this is about to break, that could be, like, a step up with from a technology standpoint, right? Absolutely, absolutely
like, but that's today, right? So, man, what? What is doing that part, which is reactive, right? Like bubbling up, you know incidents and the root causes, right?

Absolutely, absolutely
S Speaker 217:21and proactive is, like, definitely going to be a step up. But the nuance here, right? Is, is basically, and that's why I kind of like this. We talked about this in like these two phases. The thing is, but the actually customer go, you have to convince, right? Like and like,
and proactive is, like, definitely going to be a step up. But the nuance here, right? Is, is basically, and that's why I kind of like this. We talked about this in like these two phases. The thing is, but the actually customer go, you have to convince, right? Like and like,

S Speaker 117:36essentially, he's very he's not ready to believe, right? And the thing
essentially, he's very he's not ready to believe, right? And the thing
essentially, he's very he's not ready to believe, right? And the thing
essentially, he's very he's not ready to believe, right? And the thing
S Speaker 217:41is, like, essentially reactive is something which is, like, basically more measurable, right? Measurable, which is fine, like, see what we are going in, right? When we kind of, like, go to a customer, like, basically what we have, we say that we are responsible for your top line uptime metric, yeah. So basically, like, essentially, one of our, like, main customers, like we said that, like, Hey, your service, right? Essentially, I mean, has currently an uptime of, like, essentially x percent, right? A lot your numbers, but let's say like that X was like 95% right, basically where we started with. And we say deductive is kind of like, going to make sure that, like this uptime, actually, within the, like, essentially, next few months, gets to 99% right? That is basically a very kind of, like, clear value in the mind of the,
is, like, essentially reactive is something which is, like, basically more measurable, right? Measurable, which is fine, like, see what we are going in, right? When we kind of, like, go to a customer, like, basically what we have, we say that we are responsible for your top line uptime metric, yeah. So basically, like, essentially, one of our, like, main customers, like we said that, like, Hey, your service, right?

That is basically a very kind of, like, clear value in the mind of the,
S Speaker 118:33yeah, any downtime is lost revenue, right? So they can quantify that, you know, we so actually, that's very smart way of doing it, because you are then measurable for the customer to also spend more and continue growing, and maybe then they expand to being proactive, right?
yeah, any downtime is lost revenue, right? So they can quantify that, you know, we so actually, that's very smart way of doing it, because you are then measurable for the customer to also spend more and continue growing, and maybe then they expand to being proactive, right?

S Speaker 218:48Yeah. And this was kind of like, in fact, like one of the great advice that Ian gave me, like, you always have to, kind of like, actually tie this to a value, right? Yeah. This is, like, one of the reasons, and I'll talk about the technical side of things as well. But this is, like, inspired, like, deductive, is kind of like playing a slightly different product game compared to our competitors, right? Our competitors like, I mean, essentially, and the few ones that we kind of like keep an eye on, right? I mean, the good ones, right? There's a lot of noise in the market. Lot of noise competitors are kind of like, the good ones are actually really kind of like, focused on, hey, like, an alert comes into the system, and I'll somehow, like, root cause it, and kind of like, give you a good answer, right? That's kind of like, basically the playbook that most of them are kind of like playing with. We want to kind of like, basically slightly play a different playbook right under the hood, like we might this is obviously, like, one of the things we do, right for a lot of our customers. But we want to kind of like, basically have a playbook around this kind of, like, whole uptime approach that, hey, we are responsible for, kind of like, basically improving your uptime. That's what charge on. That's kind of like basically what our playbook is, whether that translates into like 20 alerts at debug or prevents like three problems from happening in the first place, or anything else is one thing. So in the next few months, I might be actually doing the first thing, but then the next three months, or the following three months, I'll be doing so that's kind of like a product strategy and how we have been the technology is like a whole different gambling ball game. So again, from a technology perspective, like, the main reason why differentiates with like, essentially a lot of like, players in this market is market is we are kind of, like, effectively using reinforcement learning, right, like, so ultimately, it is that like, essentially, and, I mean, the intuition here is that like, ultimately, every kind of like issue that you are investigating, right, whether it's reactive, proactive, like, I mean, all of that is like, essentially a filter right on the code. But like, any issue that you're kind of like investigating, you have to, like, an algorithm or a plan to go from the problem that have never seen to the solution, right, to the solution, right? Exactly. So now the idea here is, like, I mean, intuitively speaking, like that, essentially, if I can see enough labels, right? Enough labels for problem to solution, and I kind of like, basically look into and learn on like these kind of like end to end labels, as well as like parts of those labels, then I should be able to, kind of like, actually make a lot of progress on any other class of problem, or any kind of, like, basically new class of problem that I'm not leveraging, leveraging that level existing information, right? So it's not about basically reading or learning from like, 1020, 100 labels. It's actually learning from millions of labels. And that is kind of like, basically where our, kind of like, main IP comes in. So our, that's the core model, the core models, yeah. So we are not, like, basically trading models from scratch, but like, essentially, we are doing a lot doing a lot of like this, basically fine tuning and all these kind of things invested in the company. So we basically use a lot of like mosaic infrastructure to kind of like, fine tune our models. But like Rs, like, effectively the core IP, which is very different from like, 90% of the fares, because most of the people, what they are doing right now. It's like, simply, they're using, like, good off the shelf models, and then, kind of, like, basically, just like, using these models for calling a certain kind of, like, set of tools, kind of like, actually work, right? I mean, if, like, if there is, like,
Yeah. And this was kind of like, in fact, like one of the great advice that Ian gave me, like, you always have to, kind of like, actually tie this to a value, right? Yeah. This is, like, one of the reasons, and I'll talk about the technical side of things as well. But this is, like, inspired, like, deductive, is kind of like playing a slightly different product game compared to our competitors, right? Our competitors like, I mean, essentially, and the few ones that we kind of like keep an eye on, right? I mean, the good ones, right? There's a lot of noise in the market.

So again, from a technology perspective, like, the main reason why differentiates with like, essentially a lot of like, players in this market is market is we are kind of, like, effectively using reinforcement learning, right, like, so ultimately, it is that like, essentially, and, I mean, the intuition here is that like, ultimately, every kind of like issue that you are investigating, right, whether it's reactive, proactive, like, I mean, all of that is like, essentially a filter right on the code. But like, any issue that you're kind of like investigating, you have to, like, an algorithm or a plan to go from the problem that have never seen to the solution, right, to the solution, right? Exactly. So now the idea here is, like, I mean, intuitively speaking, like that, essentially, if I can see enough labels, right? Enough labels for problem to solution, and I kind of like, basically look into and learn on like these kind of like end to end labels, as well as like parts of those labels, then I should be able to, kind of like, actually make a lot of progress on any other class of problem, or any kind of, like, basically new class of problem that I'm not leveraging, leveraging that level existing information, right? So it's not about basically reading or learning from like, 1020, 100 labels. It's actually learning from millions of labels. And that is kind of like, basically where our, kind of like, main IP comes in. So our, that's the core model, the core models, yeah. So we are not, like, basically trading models from scratch, but like, essentially, we are doing a lot doing a lot of like this, basically fine tuning and all these kind of things invested in the company. So we basically use a lot of like mosaic infrastructure to kind of like, fine tune our models. But like Rs, like, effectively the core IP, which is very different from like, 90% of the fares, because most of the people, what they are doing right now. It's like, simply, they're using, like, good off the shelf models, and then, kind of, like, basically, just like, using these models for calling a certain kind of, like, set of tools, kind of like, actually work, right? I mean, if, like, if there is, like,
Yeah. And this was kind of like, in fact, like one of the great advice that Ian gave me, like, you always have to, kind of like, actually tie this to a value, right? Yeah. This is, like, one of the reasons, and I'll talk about the technical side of things as well. But this is, like, inspired, like, deductive, is kind of like playing a slightly different product game compared to our competitors, right? Our competitors like, I mean, essentially, and the few ones that we kind of like keep an eye on, right? I mean, the good ones, right? There's a lot of noise in the market. Lot of noise competitors are kind of like, the good ones are actually really kind of like, focused on, hey, like, an alert comes into the system, and I'll somehow, like, root cause it, and kind of like, give you a good answer, right? That's kind of like, basically the playbook that most of them are kind of like playing with. We want to kind of like, basically slightly play a different playbook right under the hood, like we might this is obviously, like, one of the things we do, right for a lot of our customers. But we want to kind of like, basically have a playbook around this kind of, like, whole uptime approach that, hey, we are responsible for, kind of like, basically improving your uptime. That's what charge on. That's kind of like basically what our playbook is, whether that translates into like 20 alerts at debug or prevents like three problems from happening in the first place, or anything else is one thing. So in the next few months, I might be actually doing the first thing, but then the next three months, or the following three months, I'll be doing so that's kind of like a product strategy and how we have been the technology is like a whole different gambling ball game.

S Speaker 122:14essentially give you the root cause. Of course, any connect the dots and we'll give you some root cause, right? But it'll not

S Speaker 222:20discovery, yeah, so, so discovery, right? Like, so that's why, like, most of our POCs, the reason we win is not because we have a great sales team or, kind of, like, marketing team. We just have accuracy, right? Like, so at the end of the day, like, I mean, we just basically, like our,
discovery, yeah, so, so discovery, right? Like, so that's why, like, most of our POCs, the reason we win is not because we have a great sales team or, kind of, like, marketing team. We just have accuracy, right? Like, so at the end of the day, like, I mean, we just basically, like our,

22:35that's a that's a good that's
that's a that's a good that's
that's a that's a good that's
that's a that's a good that's
S Speaker 122:38a good point, right? I'll maybe just debate a little bit here, right? So there is one approach where you could be very deterministic. And this is the pre AI approach, which is I want to be. This is my rule, right? If the latency drops by this much, check x, if then that fails. So if then, if then, if then, you have multiple rules, and you know, you get to some kind of root cause. That's deterministic, right? What you're saying is, you know, you train a model. Use reinforcement learning. You learn from patterns. You know, you prepare for a newer scenario that you've never encountered. There is, there's lack of you know certainty there, right? So how do you like, or maybe I'm not getting the potential of your platform completely, actually make it how do you make it accurate, right?
a good point, right? I'll maybe just debate a little bit here, right? So there is one approach where you could be very deterministic. And this is the pre AI approach, which is I want to be.

So how do you like, or maybe I'm not getting the potential of your platform completely, actually make it how do you make it accurate, right?
S Speaker 223:24Yeah, so let me kind of, like, basically challenge the first assumption. Yeah, it's like, the deterministic approach actually doesn't work, and it has never worked, right? Like, I mean, you guys started familiar with, like, literally, the whole AI ops phase that was, like, the thing that, like, they packed up trying to do, or MOOC software's trying to do, right? Like, they basically said, hey, you know what? I mean, they work kind of like in some ways, like, basically baby RL companies, right? They said that, okay, we don't, like, effectively, every problem in the world can actually be boiled down into like, 100 rules, right? And I'm going to have, like, basically write these 100 static rules, and I'll basically, like, assume that, like, hey, everything is happening actually. Basically that doesn't work because, like, real world doesn't work like that. Real world doesn't work like that. And like, software is constantly evolving. No problem. Like, basically happens in the past, occurs again, ideally, right? So determinism, by definition, is not there in our space, by the way, just to kind of like, basically draw parallel, that determinism is not there, even in the code chain space, right? Like, so if like, cursor does not do RL, there is no way that it can actually like, basically like, be the product that it is right now, right? Like, I mean, plot code and all like, basically RL is like, the only way to kind of like, actually embrace this indeterminism and kind of like, move from it, from faith. So that's kind of like basically one thing, but, but your point, like, the second problem is the heart and the hardest kind of legacy thing is, right? Like, so doing R and at scale data is also not easy, because in some ways, it's like a game of like, you need to have enough customers, to have legacy to get the label data, so that you, of
Yeah, so let me kind of, like, basically challenge the first assumption. Yeah, it's like, the deterministic approach actually doesn't work, and it has never worked, right? Like, I mean, you guys started familiar with, like, literally, the whole AI ops phase that was, like, the thing that, like, they packed up trying to do, or MOOC software's trying to do, right?

S Speaker 125:06course, of course. You need the scale. You need the scale to run it. Yeah, exactly. But
course, of course. You need the scale. You need the scale to run it. Yeah, exactly. But
course, of course. You need the scale. You need the scale to run it. Yeah, exactly. But
course, of course. You need the scale. You need the scale to run it. Yeah, exactly. But
S Speaker 225:11the problem with like, the advantage of the second approach, is that it does not increase in determinism. It actually, like, basically reduces it right, because what you are learning, right, like, basically, so I'll give you a kind of, like, very intuitive example, right, like, effectively, if you're kind of like actually learning on every issue, right? I mean, that kind of like comes from Spark, right, like, actually at scale across the world, that's fine, yeah, if you look like, basically, like paid models that actually like, I mean, basically,
the problem with like, the advantage of the second approach, is that it does not increase in determinism. It actually, like, basically reduces it right, because what you are learning, right, like, basically, so I'll give you a kind of, like, very intuitive example, right, like, effectively, if you're kind of like actually learning on every issue, right?

25:45so that is the only way to
so that is the only way to
so that is the only way to
so that is the only way to
S Speaker 125:47decrease the I understand. So this is more deterministic than a rule based system. It's like, counter intuitive, right?
decrease the I understand. So this is more deterministic than a rule based system. It's like, counter intuitive, right?
decrease the I understand. So this is more deterministic than a rule based system. It's like, counter intuitive, right?
decrease the I understand. So this is more deterministic than a rule based system. It's like, counter intuitive, right?
S Speaker 225:55The right? Technical term, at least the way that we use it is like, fan out, though, right? So, so effectively, the intuition here is, think about the last piece of open source software that you guys
The right? Technical term, at least the way that we use it is like, fan out, though, right? So, so effectively, the intuition here is, think about the last piece of open source software that you guys
The right? Technical term, at least the way that we use it is like, fan out, though, right? So, so effectively, the intuition here is, think about the last piece of open source software that you guys
The right? Technical term, at least the way that we use it is like, fan out, though, right? So, so effectively, the intuition here is, think about the last piece of open source software that you guys
S Speaker 126:08have worked on, yeah, like, oh, I mean, I would say olama is one of the models that I use, not yet. Or open observe, open observer, let's open observer might be one,
have worked on, yeah, like, oh, I mean, I would say olama is one of the models that I use, not yet. Or open observe, open observer, let's open observer might be one,
have worked on, yeah, like, oh, I mean, I would say olama is one of the models that I use, not yet. Or open observe, open observer, let's open observer might be one,
have worked on, yeah, like, oh, I mean, I would say olama is one of the models that I use, not yet. Or open observe, open observer, let's open observer might be one,
S Speaker 226:17right? So, basically, that is, like, basically one kind of, like, open source software that you have, kind of like, worked on, and that's kind of prepared right now, the thing is, like, essentially, let's say, like, a bug comes in the system, right, and you kind of want to actually debug it in, like, I mean, the baseline, right? If the model actually does not know anything about your system, right? Think about, like, what are the set of hypotheses that can generate? And say, like, give it an infinite like, like, basically
right? So, basically, that is, like, basically one kind of, like, open source software that you have, kind of like, worked on, and that's kind of prepared right now, the thing is, like, essentially, let's say, like, a bug comes in the system, right, and you kind of want to actually debug it in, like, I mean, the baseline, right? If the model actually does not know anything about your system, right? Think about, like, what are the set of hypotheses that can generate? And say, like, give it an infinite like, like, basically
right? So, basically, that is, like, basically one kind of, like, open source software that you have, kind of like, worked on, and that's kind of prepared right now, the thing is, like, essentially, let's say, like, a bug comes in the system, right, and you kind of want to actually debug it in, like, I mean, the baseline, right? If the model actually does not know anything about your system, right? Think about, like, what are the set of hypotheses that can generate? And say, like, give it an infinite like, like, basically
right? So, basically, that is, like, basically one kind of, like, open source software that you have, kind of like, worked on, and that's kind of prepared right now, the thing is, like, essentially, let's say, like, a bug comes in the system, right, and you kind of want to actually debug it in, like, I mean, the baseline, right? If the model actually does not know anything about your system, right? Think about, like, what are the set of hypotheses that can generate? And say, like, give it an infinite like, like, basically
26:45latency, so effectively,
latency, so effectively,
latency, so effectively,
latency, so effectively,
S Speaker 226:49like, I mean, it can kind of like, go crazy, right? Like, I mean, it can be a bug in the code, or it could be like, and actually scrutinize every box can look at. So the intuition I'm trying to basically point out is that if you kind of, like, basically do, like, the just, I mean, just for this complex, a very dumb approach, right? Like, where you actually, literally, there's like, brute force, forcing it, yeah. So the thing is, like, I mean, you can still generate all the exhaustive list of hypotheses, right? So what will like, basically something that is kind of like, that has seen like enough labels on open observe you. It will just basically give you like a seeding function to rank the list of like hypotheses of problems in a certain order, which basically has you have seen in the past
like, I mean, it can kind of like, go crazy, right? Like, I mean, it can be a bug in the code, or it could be like, and actually scrutinize every box can look at. So the intuition I'm trying to basically point out is that if you kind of, like, basically do, like, the just, I mean, just for this complex, a very dumb approach, right?

So the intuition I'm trying to basically point out is that if you kind of, like, basically do, like, the just, I mean, just for this complex, a very dumb approach, right? Like, where you actually, literally, there's like, brute force, forcing it, yeah. So the thing is, like, I mean, you can still generate all the exhaustive list of hypotheses, right? So what will like, basically something that is kind of like, that has seen like enough labels on open observe you. It will just basically give you like a seeding function to rank the list of like hypotheses of problems in a certain order, which basically has you have seen in the past

S Speaker 127:37you have seen, right, right? So, and then you go in that order, right?
you have seen, right, right? So, and then you go in that order, right?
you have seen, right, right? So, and then you go in that order, right?
you have seen, right, right? So, and then you go in that order, right?
S Speaker 127:47right? Super, super interesting. And, and I know, I know we are on time. You're Samir, I wanted to maybe have a longer discussion. And, you know, understand, you know more about the company, and I get that you want to keep the team lane. But at some point maybe, you know, think talk about, can we do a POC with Qualcomm? And, you know, the Qualcomm scale is massive, as you as you can imagine, we are a multi cloud on prem cloud native stack. We also have bunch of legacy code, right, so, and multiple different environments, right? So this could be interesting. But where are you in the journey?
right? Super, super interesting. And, and I know, I know we are on time. You're Samir, I wanted to maybe have a longer discussion.

S Speaker 228:23Yeah, if, like, there is an opportunity, we would love to do that. Like, I mean,
Yeah, if, like, there is an opportunity, we would love to do that. Like, I mean,
Yeah, if, like, there is an opportunity, we would love to do that. Like, I mean,
Yeah, if, like, there is an opportunity, we would love to do that. Like, I mean,
S Speaker 128:26essentially, do you have customers at that scale today? Absolutely. So we
essentially, do you have customers at that scale today? Absolutely. So we
essentially, do you have customers at that scale today? Absolutely. So we
essentially, do you have customers at that scale today? Absolutely. So we
S Speaker 228:30have, like, basically public companies, which are our customers? Like, so I have to, kind of like, learn a little bit more about quad comments, kind of like, scale and all these kind of things to better kind of like, answer that question. Yeah. We have, like, basically companies that you have heard of in, like, probably the retail space and all things. These are public companies. So
have, like, basically public companies, which are our customers? Like, so I have to, kind of like, learn a little bit more about quad comments, kind of like, scale and all these kind of things to better kind of like, answer that question. Yeah.

we have, like, Starbucks and stuff,
we have, like, Starbucks and stuff,
we have, like, Starbucks and stuff,
S Speaker 228:53I will kind of, like, basically, not name names, but like, essentially, I think, like, we have, like, deployed detective in like environments that have, kind of like this one scale also, like, the other thing I want to kind of like call out is our typical POCs, right? Like, and we kind of, like, basically work with a lot of like these, kind of, like big companies can actually start with, like, just a team of people, or a two team, right, like, you can scope it, like to be asked, and you
I will kind of, like, basically, not name names, but like, essentially, I think, like, we have, like, deployed detective in like environments that have, kind of like this one scale also, like, the other thing I want to kind of like call out is our typical POCs, right?

yeah, you can probably, like, basically target next Friday, if that's okay for you guys.
S Speaker 129:44Like, yeah, next Friday works. Next Friday works. And are you, when are you planning to fundraise? Just
Like, yeah, next Friday works. Next Friday works. And are you, when are you planning to fundraise? Just
Like, yeah, next Friday works. Next Friday works. And are you, when are you planning to fundraise? Just
Like, yeah, next Friday works. Next Friday works. And are you, when are you planning to fundraise? Just
S Speaker 229:49tentative timeline, yeah. So I think, like, I mean, we are typically, or tentatively looking at by the end of this
tentative timeline, yeah. So I think, like, I mean, we are typically, or tentatively looking at by the end of this
tentative timeline, yeah. So I think, like, I mean, we are typically, or tentatively looking at by the end of this
tentative timeline, yeah. So I think, like, I mean, we are typically, or tentatively looking at by the end of this
S Speaker 129:55year. So there are like, which is now, which is like it has just started. Like you'll probably start in like a month or two, right?
year. So there are like, which is now, which is like it has just started. Like you'll probably start in like a month or two, right?
year. So there are like, which is now, which is like it has just started. Like you'll probably start in like a month or two, right?
year. So there are like, which is now, which is like it has just started. Like you'll probably start in like a month or two, right?
S Speaker 230:04Yeah, so two months is, like, basically what I was thinking like, I mean, we want, don't want to also extend it too much, but like, starting around two months and we kind of, like, basically want to close, like, a few more deals so that, no, no,
Yeah, so two months is, like, basically what I was thinking like, I mean, we want, don't want to also extend it too much, but like, starting around two months and we kind of, like, basically want to close, like, a few more deals so that, no, no,
Yeah, so two months is, like, basically what I was thinking like, I mean, we want, don't want to also extend it too much, but like, starting around two months and we kind of, like, basically want to close, like, a few more deals so that, no, no,

S Speaker 231:16it was a pleasure to meet you folks. Like, two things I would like really appreciate, is like, yeah, if there's an opportunity for Qualcomm, I think it would Qualcomm, I think it would be amazing. In fact, like, I mean, yeah, basically, then, like, partnering with you guys
it was a pleasure to meet you folks. Like, two things I would like really appreciate, is like, yeah, if there's an opportunity for Qualcomm, I think it would Qualcomm, I think it would be amazing. In fact, like, I mean, yeah, basically, then, like, partnering with you guys

S Speaker 131:28would be, like, essentially more of without saying, that's why I was the one who offered this. I am offered about it, yeah. And the other
would be, like, essentially more of without saying, that's why I was the one who offered this. I am offered about it, yeah. And the other
would be, like, essentially more of without saying, that's why I was the one who offered this. I am offered about it, yeah. And the other

S Speaker 232:51So, like, basically, have been using primarily, like Docker, in Docker. Like, I mean, that's kind of like a homegrown obviously. Like, I mean, basically I'm talking to like, Ivan and all like from Daytona and like, I mean, there are like, a bunch of like different players, kind of like, coming up as well. We do want to, kind of like, actually do like a proper apple to apple comparison, to see like and see if like that would be like work kind of technically, a technical merit. But right now, I mean, we have been kind of like, I mean, we have been victimized the Docker and Docker layer.
So, like, basically, have been using primarily, like Docker, in Docker. Like, I mean, that's kind of like a homegrown obviously.

them. Oh, man, don't say that. Come on.
them. Oh, man, don't say that. Come on.
them. Oh, man, don't say that. Come on.
S Speaker 233:59Like, I mean, Bogomil is like, so we have the term sheet from Sequoia as well. We hit, but, like, because of that, I know Bogomil quite well. So
Like, I mean, Bogomil is like, so we have the term sheet from Sequoia as well. We hit, but, like, because of that, I know Bogomil quite well. So

S Speaker 134:08Daytona, anyway, I was, I was talking to them two days ago. I am not kidding, right. So
Daytona, anyway, I was, I was talking to them two days ago. I am not kidding, right. So
Daytona, anyway, I was, I was talking to them two days ago. I am not kidding, right. So
Daytona, anyway, I was, I was talking to them two days ago. I am not kidding, right. So

the due diligence phase, like, between us, but, but just, just a data point.
S Speaker 134:20No, no, I read the due to phases like it can go as long as it's Sequoia, can run way faster than I can. So good, good that you let me know. But thanks, thanks, Amir and and, yeah, let's, let's stay in touch and catch up next, next Friday. Yeah, have a good weekend. Bye. Take care.
