S Speaker 26:48in terms of harmonic so you guys are using PitchBook, one of the biggest things that I've noticed, especially with teams that are looking to write seed sage checks that use PitchBook. I worked there for three years prior to harmonic so, you know, great tool. They've definitely got good like funding data, but they really fall short and covered covering, like pre seed stealth stage companies. They also don't track when people join or when people leave, which is normally a massive signal that investors use harmonic for. And then other last one is, you know, the way that the database is structured. So in PitchBook, when they ingest a new company, someone looks at that profile for all of about a minute and picks what tags belong there. So industries, verticals and keywords, that is how you filter the database, Boolean logic, very old school, yes, with harmonic the way that we differ not only just tracking people who joined, people who left, companies at inception, when we find a company, we scrape the website text and any data that we can find about it on the public web. Then convert that to a semantic embedding, which means that you can run a natural language search for, let's say, like data center organization.

S Speaker 18:08Sorry, sorry for blinking your flow. But very quick question there, when you say search the web for all data sources, can you name a few data sources that you would tap into that pitch book would miss, probably,

S Speaker 28:20so that pitch book would miss everything on LinkedIn. So anytime a new founder, let's say spins out of you know, let's say open AI Qualcomm. Perplexity, any of you know the great companies that you guys are probably wanting to track? Yeah, everyone else wants to track. We'll scan LinkedIn to see when people leave to go become a new founder, typically a year or two before they even show up on PitchBook. We're also tracking 1000s of different blogs, newsletters, sub stacks, Twitter, anywhere a founder is going to say, Hey, I'm launching this company, or, Hey, I just made a new hire. Hey, we just got a pilot in place with this person. We're scraping all of that, aggregating it into the same system so that you can track diligence and essentially just optimize this entire top of funnel. And does that make sense in terms of, like, kind of the core differences in

S Speaker 19:17database? Yes, and that's exactly something that I am particularly hopeful that we'll be able to adopt. Jack pagebook has been great in terms of, say, just giving us post investment data, but we'd like to be more proactive and sort of be a step ahead in terms of sourcing. So, yeah, that definitely makes sense,

S Speaker 111:00And Jack of these two say methodologies that you mentioned, I think the one which would resonate more for us would be the first one, thematic, thematic sourcing, especially, I would say we have done seed, but our muscle there is not as strong. We would invest in some very incredible founding teams, for sure, but other than that, we our sweet spot would roughly be around series A so say in the semantic search. Can I, in case, in most of the cases, say revenue is not a public figure? Would harmonic be able to do a fair guesstimation and give me companies still which fit the criteria, or would it completely skip them? If I saw something like that,

S Speaker 211:43I would, I would consult and steer people to not use revenue. There are other proxies that we can use, headcount, web traffic, growth, all of those other signals that we can look at also look at, which it's almost like combining your your kind of top down and bottom up. When we look for something that's like, show me someone who has left an enterprise AI company that's raised more than $100 million to go join a company that's raised one to $25 million in AI, because it shows you like, who are the people that are leaving $500,000 a year type jobs to go skit on an early stage startup, and that's oftentimes where a lot of teams will find great signal.

S Speaker 112:29Super interesting. Yeah, that makes sense. Chuck, can we go through a demo? So there's this one company I'm very closely talking to right now. Would love to see the view that harmonic can provide me about some of these players.

S Speaker 212:44Yeah. So this is I just started sharing my screen. Can you see that coming through? Yes, cool. So this is the harmonic database. I've got my network columns added here to this view so I can see who last emailed, when the last mutual LinkedIn connection was and then founding headcount, funding, description, all of that, yeah, if I wanted to just look up a quick company, I can just go to Quick Search.

S Speaker 214:02In terms of deep research, I'm going to kick off a deep research report right now. This is going to go out and scan everything that we can find, put together a 15 page PDF on them. In the meantime, I can see that their seed was for 27 point 5 million from ballistic, GV, Ro And artisanal ventures, and then we sourced it from some news articles here. Cool, landscape wise, these are the similar companies, but we're going to get much better data once this research reports completed, and we'll get market maps right here. Interesting. I can see company social, so their web traffic is really exploding, and their LinkedIn followers had steady growth up to 4400 network wise, it looks like my colleague Aaron McCarthy is connected to the co founder member board of directors. And then, just to close loop here, Gil looks like we don't have his email, but we've got Rogers emails, and then we've also got Rick's emails here, got it,

S Speaker 115:09got it. And from, from, say, email sourcing, perspective Jack, would you say it's ease on the on par, or better than PitchBook,

S Speaker 215:21I'd say it's a little better than pitch books. Pitch book, they just kind of like, I think they've got some kind of partnership with one of those, like email providers, yep. For us, what we do is we propose every single combination and then push that to never bounce, and then we return any matches that we get

S Speaker 215:50But let's, let's take this and use this as a workflow. So witness AI security platform that facilitates safe deployment of artificial intelligence and enterprises by monitoring AI activities, enforcing usage policies, protecting data from misuse or attacks. Let's take that description. I like that security platform that facilitates safe deployment. I'm going to go ahead and just punch that right in the scout.

16:17This is a description of the company. Yes,
This is a description of the company. Yes,
This is a description of the company. Yes,
This is a description of the company. Yes,
S Speaker 216:21I'm just going to search to see every single other company that has a similar description.

I'm just going to search to see every single other company that has a similar description.
I'm just going to search to see every single other company that has a similar description.
S Speaker 216:38What this is going to do here is essentially two steps. So it's going to first construct a search, which I can see here. So these are all the companies that it's going to review. There's 14,000 it's going to review through all of them, do a web search for each one, and then identify which ones are strongest, match which ones are somewhat relevant, and then which ones are not relevant? So it's going to actually go through here and do your next job of opening up all these companies to find which ones are the most relevant. Yeah, and it'll actually just do it for you.

So it's going to actually go through here and do your next job of opening up all these companies to find which ones are the most relevant. Yeah, and it'll actually just do it for you.

S Speaker 118:09This is certainly very interesting. Jack, and then I can go ahead with the say, prompt based engine and continue my workflow from here I can, I can say, ask it to filter based on a few criterias, things like that.

S Speaker 218:24And exactly once this is done, I could then say, you know, show me only those that have raised less than 30 million. Show me those that have, you know, founded in the past five years. Like, yeah, you can look on any of that other criteria.

S Speaker 118:38Super interesting. Yeah, super interesting. And how does the notification system work? Jack, say I have something on track. To what extent can I set up a notification and have it proactively reach out back to me?
Super interesting. Yeah, super interesting. And how does the notification system work? Jack, say I have something on track. To what extent can I set up a notification and have it proactively reach out back to me?

S Speaker 218:54Yeah, so let's say I tune this a little bit I get this to the area that I want it to. Let's say I tune it to, like, let's say sub 10 million raised founded on or after 2019, maybe. And then I could just set alerts so email or slack notifications every single time we've got a new company, yeah.
Yeah, so let's say I tune this a little bit I get this to the area that I want it to. Let's say I tune it to, like, let's say sub 10 million raised founded on or after 2019, maybe. And then I could just set alerts so email or slack notifications every single time we've got a new company, yeah.

S Speaker 119:22And it could be based on the company's description, based on some market I'm tracking, based on, like you said, people exiting a specific startup to go to a new country, a new company, or people sort of starting to build in stealth and everything like

interesting, interesting and Jack. So do you also integrate with affinity?
S Speaker 219:54We do. So if you look at virtue AI and you want to add it to affinity, you can just hit that, and then this little affinity icon will show you whether it's already in your CRM. And then if it's not, you just click it, and then it'll add to the CRM.

S Speaker 221:19this? Yeah, absolutely. In terms of process from here, we typically do an intro call just to make sure it's relevant, and then we do a team call with some of those other users of the pilot. Once everyone is aligned and up to speed, we can then do a 48 hour pilot to get you guys actually in there test it out. And then we do some feedback, pricing wise, so pricing here is $40,000 per year for five user logins, okay, each additional user is 4000 per additional user. Every user gets unlimited downloads, queries support in terms of current traction we work with, as I mentioned, over 525, PCs, and then also some large corporates, like Databricks ventures, and then also open ai 100%

S Speaker 122:11like harmonic is definitely out there. We've been discussing harmonic quite a lot. I believe you've definitely added a lot of features than what I can imagine going through last year sometime when I, when I spoke to someone in the team this, this sounds really interesting. Jack. Let me get back to you. So on my end, you would require, say, a few members who will be in the evaluation team, and you would like to do a team intro call before you set up the sandbox, right? Yep, that would be ideal. Okay, okay, sounds good. Jack. Let me get back to you later by this week to set up the next processes.
