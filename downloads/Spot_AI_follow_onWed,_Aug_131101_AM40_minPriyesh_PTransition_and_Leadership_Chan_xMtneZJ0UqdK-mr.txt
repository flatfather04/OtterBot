S Speaker 36:09I can present, okay, I mean, very couple of things I can present, in terms of deck and stuff, but I just talked through a few things, and then we can get into the presentation. But, okay, sounds good. So I think, just to take a step back, like when we my approach to business, very simple is understanding a few things in order to build a large, scalable business. The fundamental thing that has to be true is that your individual account executive has to be productive. So if you put it, you know, if you're putting in sales and marketing, $1 and you want more than want more than $1 out, yes, then you want to make sure that sales person is making four to 5x the you know, OT, that you're paying them. And that a very fundamental business term that needs to be true, yes, to scale, yes, right?

S Speaker 26:54And they want to bring in like, a million dollars. Yeah,
And they want to bring in like, a million dollars. Yeah,
And they want to bring in like, a million dollars. Yeah,
And they want to bring in like, a million dollars. Yeah,
S Speaker 36:58exactly. And so, coming back to, like, looking at a business and saying, Okay, how do we, how do we make that happen? Because that wasn't true for us. Yeah, we were, we were probably at 40% mark of that. So
exactly. And so, coming back to, like, looking at a business and saying, Okay, how do we, how do we make that happen? Because that wasn't true for us. Yeah, we were, we were probably at 40% mark of that. So

S Speaker 47:11each person went to a 400 400 to five, yeah, yeah. Roughly 400 actually, yeah.
each person went to a 400 400 to five, yeah, yeah. Roughly 400 actually, yeah.
each person went to a 400 400 to five, yeah, yeah. Roughly 400 actually, yeah.
each person went to a 400 400 to five, yeah, yeah. Roughly 400 actually, yeah.
S Speaker 37:19And the second thing was, you look at the market and say, okay, the market, 25 years ago, used to be a system of record markets, and people supply DVRs. You recorded all the videos on a DVR, and then people started doing cloud based stuff. So you started charging a software license on top of it, 15 bucks, 10 bucks a month. And the software license allow you to basically, quote, unquote, go from reactive is somewhat proactive, because it gives you a lot of notification there's a person at your door, there's a package outside your house, there's a loading bit, and then you create some analytics and data on top of it, which made it more valuable for the businesses. But again, those things were getting tapped at license, were getting pricing by doing 10 and $20 per month, and nobody was able to break that price in our space. So even the biggest player, you think of people who are selling, who are 1000s of employees, 1,000x the marketing budget and sales budget, they're also not able to break that price point. So our fundamental decisions, okay, in order to make the business more productive, I think you're not going to get you're not going to get an AU to sell five times more number of feeds, or twice more number of feeds. So we need to focus on is to make your feeds more valuable, sure. And it was also very interesting era where context windows and the llans were getting multi one lens good enough. But we're like, we can actually understand a lot more that's happening in the video than we ever could be using object detection models and classic CNNs and stuff like that and that. We started looking at who are our customers. They were most insecure in operations. And we said, what do they do? When we tell that to the person that you know, what do they do? The user speaker sometimes tell the person you're not supposed to be here, please leave or start the flashlights or strobe lights, the security will do those actions right on operations simply, like they analyze this data to sit with the team and create training programs and how you can be more production efficient. Well, like we can take these steps and kind of automate what the humans are doing. And if you can do that, we have a much higher so you kind of going from proactive, kind of this automation there. And as we did that, our hope was that we can sell at 50 bucks per feet, and we're like that will break the what you realize we actually going to charge all the way up to $100 per feet, and customers are getting really excited about it. So that's really the central piece of strategy. Alongside that, the few things we did

so in order to charge that amount the ROI to the customer would be, they're actually reducing personnel or,
9:46yeah, to do the math,
yeah, to do the math,
yeah, to do the math,
yeah, to do the math,
S Speaker 39:47right? Yeah, that's exactly what they're thinking of like there's looking in terms of personal type and saying, Okay, today we are this person would spend 10 hours doing this. No, it's no longer doing this. If you take this person's 10 hours per week at 20 bucks an hour, 20 bucks an hour, whatever grade, yeah, you're saving 400 bucks a month, yeah? Or, sorry, a week, yeah, 1000 bucks a month. So if I come and say, pay me 100 bucks. Like, yeah, that makes sense.
right? Yeah, that's exactly what they're thinking of like there's looking in terms of personal type and saying, Okay, today we are this person would spend 10 hours doing this. No, it's no longer doing this. If you take this person's 10 hours per week at 20 bucks an hour, 20 bucks an hour, whatever grade, yeah, you're saving 400 bucks a month, yeah? Or, sorry, a week, yeah, 1000 bucks a month. So if I come and say, pay me 100 bucks. Like, yeah, that makes sense.
right? Yeah, that's exactly what they're thinking of like there's looking in terms of personal type and saying, Okay, today we are this person would spend 10 hours doing this.

Or, sorry, a week, yeah, 1000 bucks a month. So if I come and say, pay me 100 bucks. Like, yeah, that makes sense.
10:14So basically saving the labor, yeah? And
So basically saving the labor, yeah? And
So basically saving the labor, yeah? And
So basically saving the labor, yeah? And
S Speaker 310:16that's where the conversation is going. So like we, one of the customers you find last day is this corporate gamble. We're going through the vendor onboarding and legal redlining to get onboarded. Yeah, and they are paying us more than 1000 feet. And they, in fact, said, they're like, why is your pricing per feet? Just make it per hour. Because we think of a product as saying, if we didn't have you, we would have deployed a person and paying 1520, bucks an hour. So it's very easy for us to think in terms of per hour, and they're like, this is which is even better. So we've seen this kind of labor automation market happen. And so to me, there's a third wave of in cameras. The first wave was megapixels and system record. The second one was cloud connectivity. And this agent, AI, is creating this labor automation third wave, which is, I think, just about getting created. And it's pretty cool that we're able to raise this large round, because it allows us to, actually, we've built the product portfolio, yeah, and the customer base now slowly to, like, lean into this, but we've defined this category. But this will be the third like, when people look back 10 years from now, like, oh, what's been the vision of this industry? Yeah. But like, Oh, these are the major steps to, like, access to IP, cameras, cloud connectivity is the next big thing, and then agent De Gea was the next big leap in the category formation at each time the value increased in terms of the time and valuable field. That's what we've seen. And the other part of the show is the use case for PNG. They have a production line, and they want to make sure that the production line is running as per the SOPs, then operating procedures, but they're trying to increase production efficiency, but that's different than a security use case. Yeah, so the security and operations are two kinds of customers. So we built two big agents. One is operations, which is mostly internal focused, and security is mostly outside the building focused. And part of the reason is also we looked at number of people deployed in operations, in kind of manufacturing, warehousing, industrial, kind of economy, and the number of people deployed in security, retail, construction, similar industries, the combined total was about two plus million people. Yeah, you're like, Okay, there's about 100 million people employed in the US, if we can go after 2% of the workforce with an automated tool. Yeah, it's a pretty significant it's like, as big a market as, like, engineering, like, you know, coding engineers and stuff like that. So it's a pretty massive market to go up. It's a multi 100 billion dollar spend. So that's been our focus. And then it customer. It allows us to have both the products. If you want inside the building, it's a very operation heavy agent. If you want outside the building, it's
that's where the conversation is going. So like we, one of the customers you find last day is this corporate gamble. We're going through the vendor onboarding and legal redlining to get onboarded. Yeah, and they are paying us more than 1000 feet. And they, in fact, said, they're like, why is your pricing per feet? Just make it per hour.

If you want outside the building, it's
S Speaker 212:38a very security heavy agent. And where do you see more traction today.
a very security heavy agent. And where do you see more traction today.
a very security heavy agent. And where do you see more traction today.
a very security heavy agent. And where do you see more traction today.
12:42So this is a very good question.
So this is a very good question.
So this is a very good question.
So this is a very good question.
12:45I remember you as a security use
I remember you as a security use
I remember you as a security use
I remember you as a security use
S Speaker 312:47case. Mostly, yes, the we sort of, the way I see this, we from a pipeline perspective, seeing expansion both pipelines, yeah, lot like Coca Cola Proctor and Gamble. All these 45 companies are coming and talking to us about how we can make the plants more efficient, yeah, how we can make them so the if you look at revenue today, like, let's last six months revenue, 75% is coming from security, 25% public cooperations okay, but I see that from a strategic bet perspective. It's going to be equal as we go, like, in a year from now. The reason being, security use cases year. Now, if I set up a security officer and say, Hey, like, I'll give you an example, one of the largest EV charging stations in the country wanted to deploy their prompt copper theft, they can't deploy physical security guards. So the AI security guard agent product is directly into them, but the AI agents can take action, and they tell people, so they like, yes, immediate problem within talking to us, within a month, they're like, let's deploy two locations. There are 1000s of locations. There's EV charging, yeah, people stay in cable, copper theft, yeah, contacting, yeah. You take workers can take copper away, a huge problem. Do you think they have the same problem you're talking to them about that? It's just that. So at the South Tower, since it's copper, so this very quickly, they're like, this is an immediate problem, top of mind for us. Two locations go tomorrow, like in the next month, deploy two locations. We see 70% reduction. They're like 10. Soil reduction, 60. All of this happened in four months, right? So security is a very current problem. So from a sales cycle and revenue perspective, you see quick uptick. But operations is just a like with the magnetic problem, like one of the Fortune coming to work, and they're like, oh, this, if you just look at one process and optimize it, really by a few percentage points, is $100 million saving for us. So for us to spend a few million dollars improving. This is insanely amazing.
case. Mostly, yes, the we sort of, the way I see this, we from a pipeline perspective, seeing expansion both pipelines, yeah, lot like Coca Cola Proctor and Gamble.

S Speaker 214:45So you see potentially bigger opportunity on the operation side, although the sales cycle may be a little longer, but the mix of business would probably shift more towards operations
So you see potentially bigger opportunity on the operation side, although the sales cycle may be a little longer, but the mix of business would probably shift more towards operations

S Speaker 314:54balanced out. Yeah, and the way I think about it is also, I mean, probably snow solids in Metroid. I don't know if Metroid today offers a whole platform of services beyond just camera that is understood. They're leading with safety. They're leading with safety, but they offer the other products. So similarly, what my approach, like my thinking, is with large companies, when AI is starting out and might be more fragmentation and saying, oh, one AI tool for this one AI, large companies like you all will probably consolidate vendors at some point. The fact that we have, we have built capabilities, both inside and outside, the building would position us really, really well to be a great vendor to these large companies. And the reason why, I kind of emphasize that, is the large company bid is indisposed strategy of like from a very poor business model, you have to make the a productive, but the way to make it productive is to actually make your feeds more valuable. And that the technology inflection is happening. Let's leverage that and go through labor problems so that all of that happening. The other thing was very clear was, I'll give you a statue to make clear, like our business, part of the large cash fund was happening in the business, because we're very SMB focused. A lot of transaction, lot of logos. If you remember, having 800 customers, 900 customers, the first 10 million in the company required almost 750 customers. The last 5 million in the company barely 100 customers, right? And this shift is dramatically so. I killed the SME business, and we reduced so reduced like, reduced sales expense. We reduce the number of sales people from 25 to 15. And really squarely focused on larger companies making more than $300 million in revenue, and especially as we work with labor organization, to me, it was an obvious bet. I'm like people who have labor problems. We have lies amongst the labor are going to have labor automation problems? So if you have only two stores and you you have only 10 people employed, automation is less valuable to you, yeah.
balanced out. Yeah, and the way I think about it is also, I mean, probably snow solids in Metroid.

On the security side, your threat markers that you're building for that specific customer is unique to that customer. So a corporate have to different than this thing. So your AI is now watching so many much more obviously on that platform and getting fine tuned at better end. And the AI is also building custom workflows which is just built for that. So if you took us out, you're basically losing all of those knowledge and all of those hours of training. Operations, one of the things that one of the this is a company just making billions of 10s of billions of revenue their BP operations like the like. You know, the biggest problem right now most production operations is you have the people who understand the line the best, how the changeovers happen, different skills changes is normally somebody from 50s and 60s who's worked in this factory of four years. They're about to retire and this, let's call this person Joe. He said, Joe has seen probably 1000 of these processes, manually standing there seeing them. And I'm like, if you have this, AI deployed across all your plants in six months, you would have seen more than 1000 so here we can out experience Joe. But if you take this out, you're losing this AI model. We should actually see every production run in every factory. So the more we stay within, actually it gets more advantageous. And they're building now reports like yesterday, one of our customers email saying, Hey, I'm starting to build an incentive.

Here's a bells and whistles, and now you're going to the operations people, the security saying, Hey, what's your biggest pressing problem? Can I tell you how AI can solve it? And by the way, you need to replace any of your hardware infrastructure. Our initial volume proposition that we work on any camera lasting, our hardware state, that's right, works. Like, wow.

Like, you know, how we look sometimes a 90s website or earlier website on Amazon or eBay or whoever like it's kind of looks funny to us today, and I'm like, all the dashboards that are built for business to build all the business intelligence kind of look the same, and they like 2010 design.

You can click and work your way through it, but like, I think it is kind of like I wasn't like border cutters at charging stations and play an audio message and deter people like, that's what I want you to do. And choose which cameras it's already automatically connected to your peripherals, of your speakers and flashlights. It'll ask you for like, Okay, explain me what a bowl cutter is. You upload a few images. It'll be like, cool. It's gonna actually go through videos, give you some samples, and you're like, Yeah, this. This checks out, cool. Now it's ready, and then it gets deployed.

And just every 1020 minutes, they tell people like, hey, this video is under surveillance, or somebody's working, or homeless person is kind of cab how to deter them upset noises. And one of the things one of the customers realized was one of the easiest ways to annoy people, to leave and people are working on homeless people, is to play Baby shark on repeat. Have you heard that song, Baby shark? You have kids, I do, but you're older. Okay, Baby shark is really annoying kids song YouTube, and it is the most annoying kid song so they're like, crispy. It's annoying song people will leave. So in this case, with the operation assistant. You can upload a job description to the to just like an employee, like you basically be like, hey, this person's you can upload job description. You can upload multimodal supports. You can upload your SOPs, your current images of your plant, any type of images. And then it's going to watch the entire function, and it's going to give you a report card, and you define that job description that I want to report card on PPE, compliance, I want to report card on time. Compliance, I'm looking for these two things. It'll make grand chance for you. It'll create across different runs. It'll create a full report for you. And then you have an AI agent sitting on the side, which you can ask any question, saying over the last week, which was the most inefficient run? Why was it inefficient?

And they're like, We just asked this agent on the side. It's like, Hey, did the water tank come every day in the last seven days? Can you tell me a few times have come in hot longer stay on the side. But like, if they just say that last Sunday that we did came, it came mid afternoon to late evening. Average time was two or 31 minutes. This is where I spend the most time. And they're like, and they're like, Yeah, can you give me a bar graph or chart for this? Like, your bar chart done timings, like, cool. And it's like, this would have taken us multiple phone calls, me asking somebody to go and look at some records and then created, and it's like, oh, I have to search through videos and language. It's like, now two minutes. It's like, this was, this is insane. There's a car one which is using to understand how many time the because they all kind of now BP backed subscription businesses, so they're like, how many times was the person, how long the customer had to wait before you got attended to and the guidelines, they now have an agent trim like, okay, which person across the number of stores is taking longer, lesser time, etc, so any kind of operation is basically

There's a car one which is using to understand how many time the because they all kind of now BP backed subscription businesses, so they're like, how many times was the person, how long the customer had to wait before you got attended to and the guidelines, they now have an agent trim like, okay, which person across the number of stores is taking longer, lesser time, etc, so any kind of operation is basically
it's busy looking at any operational stuff, and then telling you, like, a construction company use this for, like, one of the questions they send me Snapchat, like anything. You know, we could do this. They have, they need to have a water can stick water tank has to come and put water on the ground every day for a few hours. And they're like, We just asked this agent on the side. It's like, Hey, did the water tank come every day in the last seven days? Can you tell me a few times have come in hot longer stay on the side. But like, if they just say that last Sunday that we did came, it came mid afternoon to late evening. Average time was two or 31 minutes. This is where I spend the most time. And they're like, and they're like, Yeah, can you give me a bar graph or chart for this? Like, your bar chart done timings, like, cool. And it's like, this would have taken us multiple phone calls, me asking somebody to go and look at some records and then created, and it's like, oh, I have to search through videos and language. It's like, now two minutes. It's like, this was, this is insane.

You probably have 1314, minutes to talk about future of the business as well. So
S Speaker 325:07All right, so yeah, basically, it's a lot of product use cases, anything which, on Operation security side, is already going deep into and very heavily, retail, manufacturing, construction, etc.

25:43but this is kind
S Speaker 325:46of me broadly explaining what's happening. But two things that in the future of the business side is important. The weather will increase. The pay has gone from like 15 $20 to $100 I estimate that as the air models get better, and we can actually do much more deeper reasoning and much more deeper automation, and luckily, we don't have to build those models. The models are getting built by people spending 10s of billions of dollars. Is this is where we are today, right? Sorry, $100 a week, because we can do Tetris, we can do flashlight top down, etc. But if we can get to actually talk to the dispatch officers and actually start doing more deeper security workflows. And soon AI will be able to do those things, the more we're able to challenge. Because my ultimate goal is, let's get to 10% of the human cost. So if the person costs roughly five to $6,000 a month, I think we can get to 10% of the cost for an AI version of that person or the team, and the same thing in operations right right now we can look at adherence to standard operating procedures. You have these guidelines. Is it happening by that guideline or not? But eventually the AI can give you suggestions on this team should be this is the exact training program this team should be running to improve processes or rewrite SOPs to create better adherence in the future. So as you get into and that's what an ops manager does in any of these situations, is like the more of his job that you automate, who's able to charge higher dollar value. So that's one, what I think is a product story on the GTM go to market side. I don't account for any that. I just take what is today. We're selling $100 freedom. Let's just believe that's the future. We believe that's the future. We continue to sell at $100 per fee. And, and how do we scale the business? So there are three kind of fundamental questions, which is, is there pipeline growth to support scaling? Do we have the right economics in the customer acquisition, a, productivity, etc? And, and if we do, then how? What is the model to add more base because that will create growth. So the good thing is, we walked into this first half pipeline, which is the agents part of the business, with about $3 million in pipeline. We actually did 3.5 million in revenue. The agent's business is now accounting for 70 to 80% of our revenue in quarter revenue. Like, it's gone from zero to five in six months. It's just flying off the shelf. We have a second half pipeline of, obviously, of 23 million working lot of the larger customers might take a bit, but, like, we just have a massive expansion in pipeline. What is it?

S Speaker 228:21to January 31 so it's this month starting this month starting right? Yeah. So we
to January 31 so it's this month starting this month starting right? Yeah. So we
to January 31 so it's this month starting this month starting right? Yeah. So we
to January 31 so it's this month starting this month starting right? Yeah. So we
S Speaker 328:26just finished the last quarter with almost done in revenue. And so the weighted pipeline is 5 million. Our target for the next two quarters is to just do a little over five, right? So we agents alone, without the famous business, we have enough pipeline to go make that happen, right? So, so then we have pipeline, and we were able to, we tripled
just finished the last quarter with almost done in revenue. And so the weighted pipeline is 5 million. Our target for the next two quarters is to just do a little over five, right?

S Speaker 228:44a pipeline overall. You think you can do that way in the pipeline? No problem. I think. So usually it's like, you need a 3x pipeline, but I don't know, depending how you
a pipeline overall. You think you can do that way in the pipeline? No problem. I think. So usually it's like, you need a 3x pipeline, but I don't know, depending how you

S Speaker 328:53define pipeline. So the overall pattern is 23 million rated is already taking into account. Something is the top Yeah, it's only 10% we're counting for it. So where is the classic, yeah. So weighted pipeline is kind of more one to one, and the overall pipeline is 4.1 Yeah.

S Speaker 229:08Why not over four? Right? Sorry, it's over four. Oh, no, no. What

Why not over four? Right? Sorry, it's over four. Oh, no, no. What
Why not over four? Right? Sorry, it's over four. Oh, no, no. What
S Speaker 329:12I mean is weighted pipeline to what performance we want it to be close to one by one, and then walk in pipe we want four to five, which is what we have, kind of so we feel just also, just looking at the overall pipeline growth, and I really generate more pipeline and like feeling pretty confident, okay, can we support scaling by pipeline growth? Yes, our pipeline is growing. Our green pipeline is growing. We feel good about it. Do we feel good about a unit economics, like our cap, pay back periods and, you know, sales efficiency, etc. This is what's happening. Like, our ultimate cake in the traditional VMs business was about 2.5x it's now it's 6x the the more
I mean is weighted pipeline to what performance we want it to be close to one by one, and then walk in pipe we want four to five, which is what we have, kind of so we feel just also, just looking at the overall pipeline growth, and I really generate more pipeline and like feeling pretty confident, okay, can we support scaling by pipeline growth?

expensive. But the value obviously went up huge, huge
expensive. But the value obviously went up huge, huge
expensive. But the value obviously went up huge, huge
S Speaker 330:00amount. So, so that's that's kind of changing. And the other thing is, the the sales efficiency is gone from like, point four so, and the a productivity has gone from 400k this quarter being close to 800k on an analyze basis. So now we're in that range of like, okay. So we have a high pipeline. We have the the a kind of working and now it's about, can we deploy more people on the floor? So this is kind of the chart of where you brought to be increasing since the launch of agency levels. Now, where this quarter, this was an estimate, what we actually this was q1 Yeah. This quarter, we ended close to 800
amount. So, so that's that's kind of changing. And the other thing is, the the sales efficiency is gone from like, point four so, and the a productivity has gone from 400k this quarter being close to 800k on an analyze basis.

30:42and you trying to get to a million? Yeah,
and you trying to get to a million? Yeah,
and you trying to get to a million? Yeah,
and you trying to get to a million? Yeah,
S Speaker 330:46the next six months, I'm not going to push more on a productivity. I'm actually changing a few things to make sure that we can double the next year, so we'll probably stay flat at 800 that's my I'm not pushing the lever too much then, because there are a couple of GTM changes I want to make which will allow us to really maximize our agentic playbook. So overall, when we started the year, we put a plan saying we'll reach 23 million in a bull case or in a bank case. So February one, the plan that we gave to Shah was 23,000,020 3 million until next January, until January 30, we were already sitting at 21 so we increased that plan to 26 Okay, so
the next six months, I'm not going to push more on a productivity. I'm actually changing a few things to make sure that we can double the next year, so we'll probably stay flat at 800 that's my I'm not pushing the lever too much then, because there are a couple of GTM changes I want to make which will allow us to really maximize our agentic playbook.

31:29first, after you did how much
first, after you did how much
first, after you did how much
first, after you did how much
S Speaker 331:30we did five. So we went from six. We went from roughly 15.5 last year to 20.5 and in the we're already sitting at 400k revenue in the first 10 days. So we're sitting close. We're sitting close to 21 in revenue. Yeah. And the initial time for the entire year was to get to 23 and now we'll be somewhere between 25 or 26 and then my goal is how to get from 2526 to 50.
we did five. So we went from six. We went from roughly 15.5 last year to 20.5 and in the we're already sitting at 400k revenue in the first 10 days. So we're sitting close.

S Speaker 231:53So basically you're adding about 13 or 14 new AR,
So basically you're adding about 13 or 14 new AR,
So basically you're adding about 13 or 14 new AR,
So basically you're adding about 13 or 14 new AR,
31:57correct this year? Yeah.
correct this year? Yeah.
correct this year? Yeah.
correct this year? Yeah.
S Speaker 331:59This year will be close to So 15.5 to 35, to 26,
This year will be close to So 15.5 to 35, to 26,
This year will be close to So 15.5 to 35, to 26,
This year will be close to So 15.5 to 35, to 26,
S Speaker 232:03or 10 new AR, 10 Euro. And the idea is, any
or 10 new AR, 10 Euro. And the idea is, any
or 10 new AR, 10 Euro. And the idea is, any
or 10 new AR, 10 Euro. And the idea is, any
S Speaker 332:08churn we would. So, as I said, be focusing on SMB business. We've been trying to chart a little bit, but I've shown it has been on a when we do 2.62 point 7, million churning people like less than 100k okay, so not immediately, and I let the SMB business slowly churn or like, like, if we have so high price point, great if they don't, they're just low margin. And it's like, again, the it's not a big product, because out of the earlier $15 million business, basically, businesses are only a few million dollars. All the rest comes from larger customers. So it's a small number of line number robust, one of it takes a lot of effort and time. Yeah, the and this is kind of the last bit of the scaling model is okay now that we have pipeline and we have a productivity how do we stack in people? So I basically could use the team while growing the business in the last like we used to do roughly one to two, 1.1 to 1.2 million in AR per quarter. This last quarter, we did 2.9 so, and we did this with less number of sales people, 25 to 50. So now I'm going to start. I had two more enterprise reps, but I'm slowly going to start adding people over the next few quarters. And then I'm, this is roughly, we ended this quarter about 200 so like now I'm taking eventually getting to a million dollar in attainment by next year's quarter two, yeah. And then I'm looking at ramping, ramping reps, and then I'm building a model. This model allows us to get to 50 million, close to between 47 to 50 million next year in revenues, yeah. So we had another 20 plus next year. And then, if this is going well, the idea would be to project fuel and go from 80 to kind of close to sort of 50 to close to 80 to 90. I want to go to hundreds, but I'm putting, kind of like I'm putting financial capitals in place,
churn we would. So, as I said, be focusing on SMB business. We've been trying to chart a little bit, but I've shown it has been on a when we do 2.62 point 7, million churning people like less than 100k okay, so not immediately, and I let the SMB business slowly churn or like, like, if we have so high price point, great if they don't, they're just low margin. And it's like, again, the it's not a big product, because out of the earlier $15 million business, basically, businesses are only a few million dollars. All the rest comes from larger customers. So it's a small number of line number robust, one of it takes a lot of effort and time. Yeah, the and this is kind of the last bit of the scaling model is okay now that we have pipeline and we have a productivity how do we stack in people?
