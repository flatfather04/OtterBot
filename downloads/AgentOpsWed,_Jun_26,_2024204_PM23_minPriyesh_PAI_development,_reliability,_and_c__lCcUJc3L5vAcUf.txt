S Speaker 25:34us. And this was a great overview. I really appreciated the entire overview that was very understanding. I have a couple of questions on that. Adam, where does this sit on the tech stack like you know,

S Speaker 15:50so, unfortunately, don't have this picture handy. But basically, we've mapped out like the entire like, layer, we think about is like we are a tool for like developers to basically understand what's succeeding, what's failing, what's working, what's not. Yeah, so we underpin basically every agent, it doesn't matter what type of framework you're building, you're using a framework or building something custom from the ground up. We basically steal every LM call, we see every agent interaction. So we're like kind of like the bottom line underpins every agent. We're like I like Switzerland. Here. We work with all the top frameworks because they know code tools. Nobody thinks about is this like in the same way you have like data dog posts on your on these companies. They look at all your interactions. The goal is like we want to figure out how we can basically track every agent to interact and a hacker happens Krypton

S Speaker 26:34booty interesting. Got it? And all of these partnerships, I think, is that a way is that how you are thinking about GDM right now.

S Speaker 16:44So this has been really great like when you when you have like massive consulting firms that have like founders through like autogen stocks, like it's a very good leap for us. Yeah. Those are no matches like a lot of these agents are open source agents. So the origin and Korea open source offerings for Korean I honestly have no idea these using these products so that they can see easily or maybe some engineering contributions, like data, but more plot like our SDK is open source but our dashboards closed source go to Washington email. So now we know big companies are using it, which is great. But so do you tend to kind of restrain motions? So the first is somebody signs up and starts using new jobs for free def work at Deloitte and PwC. We message them we upsell them. That's what happening. Number two is we actually include a job as part of the offering an enterprise plan for like a career AI so when they go to resell the agents out to other people are coming in as like the observability and compliance letter and somebody can charge like 30 to 50% more per contract by having this observability compliance like that and we take like a good chunk out of that to basically provide the service. The third is that basically bowls, we work with certain groups who are like building custom agents from the ground up. And we allow them they basically get access to the jobs and then they have as part of their offering. We're going like direct oftentimes. So a lot of these agents, the companies, we're building agents, they bake some of that they advise me on strategy, tell them what got tested 200 agents, I know what works, what doesn't say this is what you like. Here are the 10 best images that you should use internally. And then we're all seeing if you guys need something custom but we were

S Speaker 28:20That's very, very interesting. Adam, I do see why there is a very specific need for an agent ops versus a lot of those ml ops. Now I was a bit confused about the proposition here, but that makes a lot more sense now. That's very interesting. Where are you guys are in terms of the company I see that you raised some around last year. Are you planning to raise anytime soon?
That's very, very interesting. Adam, I do see why there is a very specific need for an agent ops versus a lot of those ml ops.

S Speaker 210:15Absolutely, that makes a lot of sense. And and thanks a lot for the candor. We really appreciate that. I'd love to make connections at least internally in the Qualcomm and see from where that goes. And maybe we can then expand into connections with a lot of our portfolio companies. Very happy to do that. You mentioned that it's a lean team right now. What sort of runway are you looking at and how many members are there in the team right now?
Absolutely, that makes a lot of sense. And and thanks a lot for the candor. We really appreciate that. I'd love to make connections at least internally in the Qualcomm and see from where that goes.

S Speaker 213:21No, I understand. I have been on the sales team, selling to enterprises, but more for more on a clean tech product. And I totally understand the longer sales cycles, but they do stick and they the arrow does build up pretty fast. So that's interesting. Love the approach. I totally get that. You mentioned that the focus right now is a little bit on the product market fit side of things, and where how does things seem there? What sort of reception Are you getting for the mug from the market from the on the prices you have right now? Yeah,
No, I understand. I have been on the sales team, selling to enterprises, but more for more on a clean tech product. And I totally understand the longer sales cycles, but they do stick and they the arrow does build up pretty fast. So that's interesting. Love the approach. I totally get that.

S Speaker 113:53so I would say like the PMF piece I think like that is like I think you know what, like we users using the product every day we see how often they're using it and how often they're coming back and during the sessions. It's more so it's like our enterprises ready to go make investments in this space? I think that's a big thing. So a lot of we're seeing a lot of like prototyping budgets. Yeah, I want to see more production budgets is the big thing. So that's kind of the main main piece. We talked to the big consulting group earlier today. They're like we were thinking about building something similar to agent ops internally and we realized it's gonna cost us a few million dollars and you know, 20 engineers, and then we're still going to have the integrations that you guys have. And then that's the type of thing where it's like, we're not building the sexiest part of the stack, but it's a deep don't want. It's like you need to undertake if you're a big company, you need to understand what these systems are doing. You need to have an audit trail for everything. So we're building this like kind of very necessary piece there. And we have like a bunch of cool features that are going up down down the road. But definitely we have found that like sticking that's what like, particular developers were built. There's no other alternative even comes close toward building.
so I would say like the PMF piece I think like that is like I think you know what, like we users using the product every day we see how often they're using it and how often they're coming back and during the sessions.

S Speaker 214:57That's very interesting. I think I'm just curious and curious to know your viewpoint on this. But the enterprise adoption for LLM technologies itself is very low right now. And later down in the stack would come age and so given that a lot of enterprises do not use AES and right now I cannot think of Qualcomm actually using an agent I might be wrong there. I might not be very informed. Do you guys think you're early on this trend? And how is the market is reviewing it right now.
That's very interesting. I think I'm just curious and curious to know your viewpoint on this. But the enterprise adoption for LLM technologies itself is very low right now.

S Speaker 115:28So right now we've seen like this like wave of like early adopters, and we start looking at hedge funds initially, they are very early. It's easy to just because they're like they're not regulated they don't have the same like you know, they're not big banks and have to do all this crazy stuff. They are making move very quick. And we saw it so crazy stuff for like getting for like 3x in your output. Basically some agents. There's only a matter of time before every team realizes the productivity gains that can happen using these agents. Yeah. I like to say like we have like 60 years and stuff work for me right now. Like I really, like it's only like, we have ones that are in research and in companies. We have ones that are getting data enrichment, we have sales agents, marketing, and they're all working for us, but even our team right now. And it's just a matter of time that once these systems are wide enough, I want to talk to developers I'm really big on like letting know like cut down the scope of your project and really focus on how can you make the biggest impact like how can you actually do something that is reliable, so that businesses will just trust you day zero? And we're starting to see a lot of companies realize, okay, we this is actually very interesting fact for us is there's some businesses who invested into our lens a few years ago, and they the investments are right offs. Okay. So like GPT one level performance is horrible, like, there's no but they have to do because they may do a $10 million investment to fine tune their model. Yeah. It's crazy to me. The companies though that didn't find two models like two three years ago are very eager to adopt this technology now, because they don't have all the baggage they don't all have like all like so that's actually been very interesting for us where it's like companies who made massive investments in like 2017 plus 2017 to 2022. These companies are now almost like the like okay, agents are great, but they're not going to you know, work well with our current stack that we've been using for the past few years. He's like, Oh, this is really cool psychology, let's move as quickly as possible. And it's because they don't have any events that I need. Jim, do you know kind of tech depth in your business stuff?
So right now we've seen like this like wave of like early adopters, and we start looking at hedge funds initially, they are very early.

Okay. So like GPT one level performance is horrible, like, there's no but they have to do because they may do a $10 million investment to fine tune their model. Yeah. It's crazy to me. The companies though that didn't find two models like two three years ago are very eager to adopt this technology now, because they don't have all the baggage they don't all have like all like so that's actually been very interesting for us where it's like companies who made massive investments in like 2017 plus 2017 to 2022. These companies are now almost like the like okay, agents are great, but they're not going to you know, work well with our current stack that we've been using for the past few years. He's like, Oh, this is really cool psychology, let's move as quickly as possible. And it's because they don't have any events that I need. Jim, do you know kind of tech depth in your business stuff?
S Speaker 217:15And do you see these other subset of companies that did not invest a lot in LM apps in 2017 Back then, do you see them developing their own agents and then requiring an observation platform for that or do you see them getting a lot of these vertical agent applications that are out there in the market

S Speaker 218:38Very interesting, Adam. That makes a lot of sense. Do you see yourself I'm just thinking on top of my head right now, but do you see yourself sort of evolving into an agent orchestration platform down the line?

S Speaker 222:20absolutely. I so much appreciate that sentiment. Right now. I am looking at a lot of agents, or vertical agent plays and for me it's slightly difficult right now. To sort of differentiate between a lot of players this seems so similar. So the beds eventually go back to the team, but I would really appreciate your input on that. Thanks a lot for offering that.

S Speaker 222:55Show. I appreciate that. Absolutely. If you can send me a blurb I'll be I'd love to pass that around internally, just so that no more folks know about you, at least at the call conference. And we'll have a discussion about you guys at the team as well. So that we are aware of everything that's going on. Really appreciate the sentiment. Thanks a lot for this time.
