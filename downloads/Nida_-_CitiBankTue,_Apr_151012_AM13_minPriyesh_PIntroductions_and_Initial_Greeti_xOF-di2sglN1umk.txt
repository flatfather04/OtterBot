S Speaker 33:05Yeah, so, I mean, it depends on a case to case. We're a very simple domestic company. I think it's traditional KYC documents in terms of the w9 you know, those standard kind of requirements. But of course, as companies, as they grow in scale, or, you know, they have more extensive geographic presence, you know, it'll be documentation that is more aligned to that. And of course, you know, we'll set up that call with the company. We walk through each game I see, trying to explain everything on the go, and even when the companies aren't wanted, you know, we have that full sort of coverage, like for 90 days. We have an implementation team that is dedicated to training, you know, the finance team, how to navigate system, or, you know, what potential things to look out for. So we have that extensive training for those companies as well. Because I think our platform, it's, you know, it has all those bells and whistles that a series p plus company would really want if, yes, there's that entire security capability, you know, we're able to, you know, really put in those extensive controls about who can use funds flow, who can transact, who can approve so, you know, having those, you know, somebody from our side training you on those. So that's where we come in. And at the same time, of course, we have a dedicated service team as well. You know, I'll be there as CRM to kind of piggyback any complications. Yeah,

S Speaker 24:44that makes sense. Maybe I can give you a pattern about Qualcomm ventures, how we operate the areas we're looking at, and then potentially any possible overly happy to discuss those. So I'm a Senior Associate in the team, being with the team for about a year now, I work in the software AI investment site and but at the same time, we look at a wide variety of industries. I would say the fund itself has been around for 25 years plus. Now we have to put $2 billion in capital, and currently have 250 plus portfolio companies active across our different geographies. So it's a global fund. We operate in United States. We have an office in Brazil, one in Israel, one in China, India and one in Europe. So a global fund, for that matter, in the USDA, we aim to deploy, about 100, 1500 $80 million a year so and we invest out of the balance sheet. So it's not a financial fund. We do not have a fund cycle, or we do not have mandates to return the fund, but we still operate as a financial fund, and try to follow the same financial discipline, if you will. And then the areas we look at is a broad variety of segments, anything which has a degree of connectivity or computer. It is something that Qualcomm would like to play in. So that means AI, IoT, industrial automation, computer vision, build tech stack, ar, VR, robotics, a wide variety of industries. I would say a big focus for us has been AI for the last year, and possibly going forward as well. And then our check sizes are two to $15 million preferably a series investor, but sometimes in AI, we have started doing serious as

S Speaker 36:02well. Is there typical? I mean, would you invest in a premium I guess not. But like, what is the revenue considerations that you want to catch up on year over standpoint? So unfortunately,

S Speaker 26:10we have invested a few premium companies, and that is what I would say the market is forcing us to do, especially in these hot AI deals. But apart from that, yes, we look for revenue considerations if you're coming in that series, A, I would say anything about a million Arr, would be a rule of use internally. But then again, it depends case on case.

S Speaker 36:31Like a lot of our names and benefit from introduction to you guys. And then for, you know, for, just for, like, a reference purpose, we also have cities, city ventures, which is essentially our investment arm, and their focus actually is a lot in the AI and cyber security space, and their portfolio companies similar mandate, I would say, revenue thresholds, but at the same time it's paycheck size is around 10 million. Do you guys take both seats or warrants?

S Speaker 26:58So we warrants, our case to case. We have taken more in sort of a few places. We do not lead on majority of the rounds, so we follow in 80% of investments we would make. And then we prefer taking board of servers, unless it's a business that is highly relevant to Qualcomm and we feel we can add significant

S Speaker 37:16strategic value. Okay, that makes sense. I mean, I'm actually meeting with the city manager's team on Thursday, and I know that the head of AI cyber security will be there, I can definitely kind of, you know, talk about Qualcomm, because I think they'll definitely be considerable overlap in terms of the companies that you guys are going after. And I'm sure they can kind of tag team any opportunities with you. And then where I can kind of kind of come into the picture is that if there's any one of your portfolio companies, I know you touched on AR VR, I think that's that would kind of fit into my bio projects as well. So if there are anything that you see in the digital media space, or even in the software space, we have a dedicated software team that is, you know, at that in touch point where they're looking to change, making partnerships, I know, just given where the market is at, and there has been some considerations. I was at a tech conference last week, and we saw the nuances of that play out real time, where, like, three people came up to me and they're like, you know, we're with SPD, and we're very worried. And I asked them, I was like, why? They're like, Oh, because, you know, we've lived through this thing about two years ago, three years ago, with the disruption, and, you know, it's like deja vu. We don't want to lose access for funds. And having a bank, a big bank, like, whether it's a JPMC or, like, any money center bank that essentially too big to fail if I don't want to exist. But, you know, it gives them that kind of peace of mind. So if you know anybody who's looking for that competition, you know, I'm happy to have that conversation and seek out my next steps. Absolutely,

S Speaker 310:21We covered four cities because, of course, and we had to go see it. We did Amir, we did Jaipur, and then we did Delhi, of course. And I'm originally from the horse there was just like a quick, well, not quick, to 10 to 12 hour bus ride. My fondest memories were, and it was an overnight bus that we took in the middle of the night. We stopped at Hava, and we had the best and, dal and what else we have? Yeah, dal and, like, fresh girl.
