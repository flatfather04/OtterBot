0:01So in Chicago, you have this great stream of, of universities. So you have Northwestern where Johan US did his PhD.

0:12And then we can do quick intros after this. But you've got the University of Chicago, which is very strong quantum configuration. The University of Illinois, has one of the best physics departments in the country. And then you have other universities as well as corporations. And the nice thing is that it's all centralized by an organization called the Chicago quantum exchange.

0:39So they put together events connect companies with talent, and it's, it works really nicely. So the other areas so Boston is strong. Denver's strong, but Chicago is probably the strongest in terms of talent.

1:28And then I ran a few businesses at Qualcomm over the last seven years, seven plus years now, Qualcomm ventures investing in I would say, ai ai infrastructure, deep tech, camera computer vision those are my expertise and background. So those are the spaces where I spend most of my time in quantum.

1:54I'll confess we haven't spent a lot of time in quantum recently, a few years ago, we spent some time in quantum. And we looked at a few companies for potential investments. We made one investment in Israel in a company called Quantum machines.

2:16A lot of them were a customer of theirs. Yeah, which is great, right? Because so the reason why we picked quantum machines as because like, Oh, it's getting very hard for us to pick a quantum computer startup. So let's pick a company that's going to sell to all the core quantum computing startups.

2:51And Qualcomm Ventures has been around for 24 years, we invest in areas that are strategically relevant to Qualcomm's areas. So the broader idea of the company is to invest in technologies that are pushing the boundaries of compute and connectivity.

3:19We really believe that we're pretty good at it.
3:24And however, there's lots of orthogonal ways of pushing compute, and that's where Qualcomm itself we used to have a quantum research group. We actually don't have a quantum research group anymore.

4:47Okay, so you do lead rounds. Also, I've noticed a few of those where you've done correct, so we do lead round as well. However, I would say like in spaces like quantum wouldn't, we wouldn't, because we don't consider ourselves as experts in that space. So we don't have an academic thesis in quantum today.

6:12the person who runs the group is based in San Diego but we've got about you know, hate investment professionals and in the US team, about six of us are in the Bay Area. So who here in San Diego so yeah, yeah, that makes I heard about Quinn. As I mentioned briefly, this was total coincidence. I met Jim Thompson, the CTO two weeks ago at an ACC conference that we both attended.

8:28I actually have a maybe a similar path to you. I was a software person that got into hardware. So I've run a number of software startups. And after I thought this was actually before I even accident, my last one.

8:47But the very short word for the story is that in 2016, when Johan has had finished his postdoc at Caltech, and became a professor at Michigan State, he has I asked him when he was going to do and he said, there's a better way to build a quantum computer that has not been pursued for various reasons, mostly given its level of technical difficulty. And so I originally was just an angel investor, because I figured, hey, I'm a software guy. What do I know about quantum computing? And then over the next two years learned from Yohannes and from others, other professors about quantum computing and in 2018, I left my software company to become the CEO, and have been so ever since. And then in 2022. We raised a seed round, and then did a seed extension. So we've raised a total of 13 million. Our lead investor is the Capital Group, the strategic venture partner of the Boston Consulting Group. They're up to about 7 billion AUM right now. So they're one of the fastest growing venture funds in history and we're very proud that their chairman Howard Morgan is on our board. And Howard was a professor of computer science in the 60s and 70s. So he saw the first hardware revolution come into play.

10:25Not the ENIAC days, but the commercialization days and so he saw a lot of those parallels. And then BCG did has a quantum practice. And they did the bulk of their due diligence on Aaron Q.

11:02My wife ran a storefront theatre company in Chicago, she's an actress and, and so Nick was on the board of directors of her theatre company back then. And I was like, Oh, he's historically No, I got to know him over the years and watched his his various startups. So you know, often those kinds of relationships and like, one of the I have a lot of friends who are interested in like developing quantum technologies and company sectors, like how do you find your business partners? How do you find the CEO and I was like, I'm the wrong person to ask because I had a very good friend who's really interested in learning really complicated things and committed himself to essentially learning all of quantum computing, like from the ground up. So I don't think those people just pop out of anywhere.

11:47Yeah, it's when it Yeah, it's perfect, kind of straight, but it's an exceptional idea. I did my PhD at Northwestern in low temperature physics, studying super fluids and quantum many body systems. And then I did a postdoc at Caltech, where I was really turned on to, to quantum computing at the Institute for Quantum Information and matter. They're originally working on topological quantum computing like things Microsoft does. But as I was preparing my own academic career, you know what I thought were the places where there was the most promise and most excitement. I this system of trapped electrons really was something that my group started working on. And yeah, I think as an excise, you know, I mean, I said, in some sense, it kind of swept under the rug a lot of the reasons for why your statement is true, but I think it does really offer I need to build a large, like people can make quantum computers out of all kinds of little things, and they're all physics experiments. And myself and my colleagues de Lyonne, at Princeton, who's our CTO, have the feeling that the scaling challenge is going to be the hard one. That's the real bottleneck. You know, you need to be able to leverage our thesis is that you need to be able to leverage essentially classical seeing with technologies, we have to use CMOS processing. I think you can't, if your system really can't interface with that, I think it's going to be you're left with the challenge of figuring out how to make an interface or to bet to new scaling. Architecture and the second of those sounds terrifying. And so we benefit like a few other technologies for the ability to integrate immediately with commercial semiconductor to families.

And then I did a postdoc at Caltech, where I was really turned on to, to quantum computing at the Institute for Quantum Information and matter. They're originally working on topological quantum computing like things Microsoft does. But as I was preparing my own academic career, you know what I thought were the places where there was the most promise and most excitement. I this system of trapped electrons really was something that my group started working on. And yeah, I think as an excise, you know, I mean, I said, in some sense, it kind of swept under the rug a lot of the reasons for why your statement is true, but I think it does really offer I need to build a large, like people can make quantum computers out of all kinds of little things, and they're all physics experiments. And myself and my colleagues de Lyonne, at Princeton, who's our CTO, have the feeling that the scaling challenge is going to be the hard one. That's the real bottleneck. You know, you need to be able to leverage our thesis is that you need to be able to leverage essentially classical seeing with technologies, we have to use CMOS processing. I think you can't, if your system really can't interface with that, I think it's going to be you're left with the challenge of figuring out how to make an interface or to bet to new scaling. Architecture and the second of those sounds terrifying. And so we benefit like a few other technologies for the ability to integrate immediately with commercial semiconductor to families.
13:22And so this was a large driver on the end the Nick was like, you we should be doing this you know, you're never This is never going to happen if you're doing this on a small you know, academic kind of scale. We need to really go for it. And so that's what we did. And yeah, that has borne fruit. I mean, that's the it's always I guess, I've gotten kind of accustomed to and now just how much faster things work in the private sector, but it's yeah, it's fantastic. I think that's really, that I'll know is your honest is actually a full time employee of error. Right. Sorry. I should have said that. Yeah. So I live. I split my time. I'm in a superposition state for at the risk of making quantum computing fun, but I live a week or two out of the every month in Chicago and then the rest of the time I'm in East Lansing, Michigan, which is only it's a three and a half hour Amtrak ride. So I just found it. Yeah, it's really super can be when we were choosing us about like, how we chose Chicago. So the talent was one aspect like we we knew there were some people we wanted to hire and reach out and like, Hey, will you move to Michigan and they were like, you know, young people, they're like, No, I want to be in a city. And, you know, it was like, okay, cool. So Chicago was sort of a nice spot because we were thinking, you know, it needs to be in close proximity to either me or to our ctoc in print. So the two places that kind of ended up being on the finalist list were Princeton, New Jersey, and but Chicago Chicago's perfect. So what we what we did is on the script, we elaborate on that so we brought out new harnesses teaching contracts, so he maintains a research group at MSU which runs you know, somewhat on autopilot, given his excellent students there.

15:08But, and postdocs, but it's also a full time employee of arrow keys. So we have a we have gone beyond the model of a sort of part time professor that's involved and are very have a very dedicated team that was mentioned, we have nine PhDs, and I can succinctly so one thing that I'll mention is that I know for investors, again, I originally came to this as an investor myself, it can be difficult to try and figure out, you know, is there going to be, you know, one quantum computing startup that is going to win the entire field? And do I have to place a bet on that? And then there's a further stress level, which is, okay, if I pick let's say, ion traps, which one of these ion trap companies is going to win? So there's, you know, a lot of different levels there that I understand and we look to address when speaking with the dusters.

17:15Our thesis is that you have to be CMOS compatible. And one of the reasons that I was excited to get the interest from Qualcomm is that we have a you guys have sort of invented our business model in terms of being a fabulous semiconductor company, because that allows us to be remarkably capital efficient, which is why we've only had to raise 30 million today to prove out what is among the largest scaling layers, that any quantum computing system. So we worked with the foundry you may be familiar with, called Sky water. And they're based in Minnesota and sky water. We haven't shipped from them that is in our lab and is working and that can hold 2432 electrons.

19:20So we will have a qubit and the largest scaling lamp and what's really nice about the system is that we're using dipole dipole gates to do our two qubit gates. And we've already built in the operation so it's for the qubits into the chip. So for our next round of financing, we're going to essentially be able to just as we develop these gate, two qubit gates, essentially drag and drop them into the scaling layer that we have already built via using CMOS.

20:36Exactly. So I think, largely what's happened with the other modalities like superconducting qubits and ion traps, and essentially silicon spin units, everything is academic groups have pushed the envelope of like, trying to make a better and better and better qubit better, better qubit. And up until very recently said You know, this scaling is an engineering problem.

20:56And that's, our thesis is that's a bad way to do anything as the scaling is not going to be the is not just a throwaway engineering problem. That is a big part of the problem. And actually building the qubits is the the relatively straightforward part. You know, we can now make qubits out of almost anything. In fact, the electrons that we have already, the qubit states that we want to manipulate are there, we're merely trying to improve our coupling to them and how we control them. But a big problem is, how are we going to, you know, get to the point where we can actually make a useful processor and that's why the scaling and the integration with CMOS is important from the outset, not as an afterthought in an article.

So they're trying to do a lot of classical simulation of quantum circuits. So they're using GPUs to really try to see how it's like an arms race.

24:55Okay, so thanks. Sorry for that. I think that at least I have now an understanding that's what I thought would have been. Yeah. I suspect that that the like if we leave error correction on one side, I suspect that all of those platforms on some level can get to this 10,000 kind of level. I don't given enough time and enough creativity, there's really smart people and they can get that working. I think my suspicion is that beyond that, it gets really tough. For for without getting into like really huge machines and like massive modular interconnects and there's a lot more problems that it's in this is really part of our thesis is that like, you're they're kind of trying to like start with something that was really great as a science experiment, and then like say, Okay, now how do we scale it? You know, now that we've gotten everything working and that's not necessarily a good way to go. You want to have some sense of how you're going to scale.

For for without getting into like really huge machines and like massive modular interconnects and there's a lot more problems that it's in this is really part of our thesis is that like, you're they're kind of trying to like start with something that was really great as a science experiment, and then like say, Okay, now how do we scale it? You know, now that we've gotten everything working and that's not necessarily a good way to go. You want to have some sense of how you're going to scale.
Okay, so thanks. Sorry for that. I think that at least I have now an understanding that's what I thought would have been. Yeah.

25:56The signing, whether you start you're you're a bit your system, based on an instant computer engineering approach, or a physics based approach, and we've taken the approach that scaling is, as you're honest, had mentioned, but I'll reiterate that scaling is the hardest part because people have made promises as you know, I've had you know, they'll get 1000 10,000 cubits in, you know, a certain timeframe. But the challenge is that if you're not compatible with c MOS, or you have larger qubits, so with electrons we're dealing with the smallest possible qubits, and that gives us a key advantage in many ways.

26:48Because we do not need any modular interconnects. So almost all other systems, the qubits are so large that to build a system of AMI reasonable scale, you need it's a looks like a supercomputer, and you have this incredibly large computer design that is very expensive to build and customers that are looking for Prem. It it's going to be very difficult for them.

27:38In that area, we can fit hundreds of 1000s if not a million electron qubits in one single machine and this has tremendous implications for the industry, because for example, there's a growing demand for on premise quantum computing. So the ability to have one single machine and it doesn't need cooling but that's it. So you all you need is one refrigerator, one chip. And that's all you need. And see moss compatibility, we can prove to investors and to future customers, the ability to scale because CMOS does not have a question mark next to it. We know that a CMOS compatible process can scale to, you know, billions if we need.

28:39So that's our approach. And one other thing I'll mention is the most similar system are silicon spin qubits, which is what Intel is working on. And that is where our secret sauce comes in, on which we have a very broad patent. And that is that by still using the same CMOS substrate, we simply add a certain layer of liquid helium above that CMOS chip.

29:11And that protects the qubit from all of the defects that you find in silicon, because as you know, silicon is it can be made exceptionally pure. And our Princeton CTO has played around with avocado, silica, the world's best silicon and even at that level, you have trapped charges, Valley splitting number of waves of defects that cause errors and decoherence. And additionally, the electron qubits with spin are stuck inside the silicon, so you can't move them around.

29:53So by simply adding this layer of liquid helium, we're able to make the qubits mobile, we're able to create the most pristine environment, essentially in all of nature to allow for much less noise and decoherence than silicon spinning humans.

30:16So that's the statement again, to summarize the thesis, it's a CMOS compatible architecture for guaranteed scaling, plus, the ability to work with your extremely clean the cleanest possible, in fact, qubit system and, and where are you in this journey now, which is what have you built and will really be wonderful.

30:48So what we've built is we've built the scaling layer up to 2432 electrons with C with CMOS foundry, and we can control 35 packets of cc of electrons and a CCD on that.

31:08We are on the cusp of proving the first ever electron helium qubit which will need to build this machine and that will be that will be achieved before the series A is raised. So those will be the two key achievements and at that point, the science part of the probe of this design will have essentially been de risked with the series A we're going to be creating a two qubit gate using the dipole dipole interaction. And this is something that has the two qubit gate has already been demonstrated in other platforms. So the reason that we didn't start with a two qubit gate is because it's already been demonstrated. We know that it could work. What we didn't know was how to create an electron helium qubit, which we now will know. And we didn't know if we could make electrons on helium work on a standard CMOS foundry chip, which we now know. So we've taken our time to initially using our own capital and then are our seed funding to prove out the two key elements of building this chip, and then the next step is is scale. So in terms of the timeline, the next step is getting the Cuban up to a coherence time of around 10 seconds, which, as you may know, is basically forever in terms of coherence times. And so we'll be using the spin of the electron and that qubit and then also using the proceeds of this series A over the next two years. To get your bits up on AWS. We have already begun the process of working with AWS also beginning to collaborate with Microsoft Azure and then the big win the big prize is that by the end of 2026, having taped out with a foundry, a 10,000 qubit chip. And because we've already got 2432 electrons it's very easy to see how that because we would have the only reason we didn't have 10,000 on that chip, is because we have limited space on a multi project wafer. But by getting a fault, we'll be doing a full wafer run. We'll have as much space as we need. And we'll be able to get 10,000 cubits kicked out by 20 in 2026.

34:29I'll mention one thing which is when we started this one of the things that kept us from raising a Series A for a while was Nick and I were like we looked at the other startups around there. And there was Righetti at the time and they were doing everything right during software. They were full stack hardware, software, all their own fat, everything you know, cloud cloud infrastructure, and I was like, Nick, I don't know how to do that stuff we have we know how to do the hardware part. We don't know how to do the other stuff. And Nick was like, I think this is going to all develop with this industry matures. That stuff's just gonna happen. There gonna be other companies that can do that. There's gonna be people you can partner with. And sure enough, I'm a little blown away by the fact that, you know, we can now interface with the Amazon folks so easily. And I've been you know, not knowing anything about that stuff. I realized, like, that's not a very important that's like a really that's a, if you have the hardware, getting it up on the cloud. That part is actually quite straightforward. Aside from like, the security stuff that you have to deal with, like that's the hard part. But it's that's not a, I don't know, it's kind of been, it's been reliable.

36:04And I'll mention two things. One is that we in about a month will have ready a quantum simulator that I'll be happy to test on simulation, everything but I think late early days of building even CMOS chips, right so you can do a lot on I mean even today, right we can do a lot on these chips, emanations and simulations. But But eventually, still find out a lot of stuff when you get when you run the real thing. Yeah, and one of That's right, that is exciting. On the positive side in terms of running the chips, it's that as you have mentioned with all the Capital and Talent flooding into the industry now.

But But eventually, still find out a lot of stuff when you get when you run the real thing. Yeah, and one of That's right, that is exciting. On the positive side in terms of running the chips, it's that as you have mentioned with all the Capital and Talent flooding into the industry now.

36:57But in addition, there are folks that are working on error correction, and focus working on more efficient algorithms. So that's where I really think there is going to be usefulness at the 10,000 level, because these more efficient algorithms will allow what would have taken 100,000 non error corrected qubits two years ago. We'll be able to do those with 10,000 Physical qubits.

37:30And what most say that's 10 or 20, logical qubits will be able to do that. So JPMorgan Chase, for example, has a team of 40 people who are only working on more efficient algorithms so that they can do more with less in terms of their in terms of the machines that they're working on. That's pretty big.

37:54Airbus, Boeing, Boeing, almost all the pharmaceutical companies. So you're going to the application site is moving very quickly. And that is going to lower the overhead needed for what you're able to do with the quantum computer. Yeah, yeah. That's what I that's what we hear also from machines that more and more people listen, he was able to attract capital in the field. And there's more excitement around the field, which is good.

38:41Let us go back discuss. So what's going to happen? Good thing is for a deep tech field such as quantum we would have to see if somebody is willing on the team has been dedicated six months into this space going in understanding and inside out and then making a decision, and we can invest or not.

39:04And then back then four years ago, we went through the same journey. We actually spent six months and then we came back with a conclusion saying okay, guys, we still don't understand as well.

39:16And we don't understand it well to say with a high level of confidence that we'll have somebody will have a 10,000 error corrected cubed controlled computer by the year 2025. They're all saying 2022 and 2023. And we still don't have you know, hardware.

39:41And this is something completely different. So we don't have a good understanding if you call it that. So I think and then at that point, we said okay, you know what, let's let's decide to place a bet when somebody has a 10,000 Aircrack ng cubed control theory.

39:59And and again, I feel I'm being kind of be, you know, front with you which how it did that's how we think our team and I'm guessing I think we will wait and enhance that's why we were like, we had enough excitement and content. So like, okay, let's just put money in quantum machine so we will have a good understanding of the space. So what we're going to do is actually the CEO of quantum machines, he's pretty he knows the space well as well. So it's up to have you and see what he thinks about if you're okay with it is yes, yeah, we know him well, and we'd be happy to have him as a reference. Yeah. Okay. So, and see, we can try and see if we can build a thesis here. If not, then could be hard for us to come in at this stage.

41:04It could very well be a fun, but if for no other reason, it could be you know, a fun exercise on your own part. To get a sense of what's happened. You know, if you looked once it's DC start changes and it could be very cool. Maybe it would do that. Let me I'm gonna go to Israel team to actually check with the CEO of quantum machines and and even last camp one, let's go maybe we do that exercise now. But that's a good idea. I think we should it's been four years so yeah, it's always fun. I like you know, when you're when you're in the weeds you see like small changes don't happen. But you know, like, whenever I got two little kids, and whenever I go out of town for a work trip, our four year old is suddenly like, when did you grow again? How did that happen? But I never would have noticed in the in the intervening time. Yeah.

42:00Be let us do some work and and I think it seems you're going to anyways, start raising it. What? A few months. Yeah, exactly. Okay, so I think we have time to do some work and thanks again and we'll be in touch. Yeah, it was a pleasure. It was it was a pleasure, and toxin. And regardless of investment. If you have any questions about quantum computing, even related to Arabic, please consider us a resource.

42:55But the dark money is also going to be awarded to companies. So yes, we'll be able to get non dilutive capital and access to resources in the region, for sure. And we have a head of policy on our team. So we are actually part of the working group that is determining what this will how the money will be spent. So an active voice in determining how that will be spent. Yeah.
