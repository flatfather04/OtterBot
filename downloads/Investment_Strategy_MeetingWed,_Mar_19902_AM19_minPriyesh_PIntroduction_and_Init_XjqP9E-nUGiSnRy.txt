S Speaker 21:41don't travel to the US as frequently, but the larger focus area remains to be seen. Irrespective of the SaaS or tech companies that are drilling out of India or the Indian Congress, the idcp always remain us. Remains us. It's a subsidiary out of India, but the headquarters is us, so therefore they overlap. Yeah, and I'm not sure how much you're aware about SIG, or Susquehanna happy to give an introduction about the fun, and, of course, myself,

S Speaker 12:09because, if you like, yeah, would love that. I have heard about si G, but I don't think I know everything about that fund and their focus area in detail.

S Speaker 22:17Yeah, sure. So we started back in 1980s as a derivatives and market making fund, and today, around 25% of all derivatives flow by Lisa Coronavirus pipes that that is a very lean business and generates few billion over free cash flow. And that is where the founders of thought of selling of different principal investment groups in early 2000 so we started venture and private equity bank in 2005 in US and China and those groups in themselves have been immensely successful, for example, that it would resonate within the US. We had Qualtrics hacker rank, high radius, just to name a few. Pack campaign, another one. And from China we we invested,
Yeah, sure.

S Speaker 23:05And so that's where the founders also set up different funds within different countries. And therefore India, within India, we are relatively new. It's been six years for us. And largely how we operate is we are sector agnostic as

S Speaker 25:15like I said, series A to pre IPO. All works. Is just that, how we look at or when we look at companies building in the US, we need to have some India angle. It could be that the founder is Indian. Does not have to be born in India as well, but has to be in some shape

S Speaker 15:35That's about it. That's that's very interesting. And I've been like, I'm speaking to a few more Indian firms. I My background is also from India, so I like to keep a track of the market in India as well. So I've been speaking to a lot of firms. And this is a persona that a lot of peak XV axle India, the green caps and a lot of these funds, they track this specific persona of people either did their masters in us and have now building in us, or have, or are building in India, but selling to the US and things like that. So that's very interesting. Do you have a specific way you are sourcing some of these companies in the US, which have, let's say, an angle in India.
That's about it. That's that's very interesting. And I've been like, I'm speaking to a few more Indian firms.

6:20Few ways, I think,
6:22of course, it gets slightly easier considering

Okay, interesting. And how does the India US team divide at least their focus areas? How does
S Speaker 110:08that work? So focus areas are the same or more or less the same, but geographies differ. So if the founder is based in India, and even if their headquarters in us, the India team leads that if the founder is based in us, we take it over.
that work? So focus areas are the same or more or less the same, but geographies differ. So if the founder is based in India, and even if their headquarters in us, the India team leads that if the founder is based in us, we take it over.

S Speaker 213:13Okay, so they are in the revenue forecasting, supply chain, forecasting space, and apparently only player that is the largest one there. It's a private equity back there, not growing anymore. Therefore a very interesting company has scaled from zero to 3 million arr. That was subs, amount of capital to another. Capital, kind of a safe node right now to their CD speed, but yeah, take a look at it, if you like. Would love to those are the focus areas in the M horizontal layer, where you have to be very architected, different. Good example, waiting out of failure. So those kind of plays, that's

S Speaker 113:56that's interesting dictionary, and a lot of parallels there as well. So we looking at the market the same way. But one differentiating factor for us is we prefer to be in companies which, let's say, have a higher degree of compute or have a more deep tech angle in them. So in a way, let's say I can give you an example. Is a recent, late stage deal series D that we did was in natody logistics space competes with samsara, has their own computer vision application, but then do a lot of the computer vision compute on the device itself, and that's where we feel we can add a lot of strategic value, or a very early stage deal more recently that we did. It's still in stealth, but it's a product. It's a productivity suit, replaces Microsoft Office and is a generative AI native company. So across talks, sheets, presentations, can prepare everything on the desktop itself, but they plan to run a lot of their compute on the PC itself. So if it's not very traditionally SaaS and they have a lot of inference time compute, or I'd say even cloud compute as well, that would be a better play for us. So that's that's something that I've been focusing on from that article. I think personally, been doing a lot of breadth first sourcing as well. But more recently, I've started doing more sub sector thesis. So in the vertical, horizontal and infra infra sectors, infra has been more, I would say, opportunistic. But in vertical, taking a look at some of these smaller sectors, like generative AI in creative tools, generative AI in security and compliance workflow automations in horizontal we're taking a look at a lot of these agent tech frameworks, like crew, AI, Lang, chain, auto Gen letter, so trying to create some sub thesis in this area, And then see if we can find a few investments worth making.

S Speaker 215:56That's interesting. Have you heard of this company called CISO on a security side?
That's interesting. Have you heard of this company called CISO on a security side?
That's interesting. Have you heard of this company called CISO on a security side?
That's interesting. Have you heard of this company called CISO on a security side?
16:02I have not known
S Speaker 216:05what they're doing is that they it's a security ad to their application, a security company, and they come in at the design level, which was initially not possible. You would start at the coding level, but no one used to do it from the design but that's what they're enabling today. They'll be there in the market right now, actually doing a 5 million series, you'd have to make that introduction as well.

16:29That's interesting. I'll take a look. Yeah.
That's interesting. I'll take a look. Yeah.
That's interesting. I'll take a look. Yeah.
That's interesting. I'll take a look. Yeah.
S Speaker 116:33So Dixit, one question I had is, I come across a lot of these founders who are not, I would say they are Indian origin, but probably second generation immigrants. Would that be a focus area for us? For you? Yeah,
So Dixit, one question I had is, I come across a lot of these founders who are not, I would say they are Indian origin, but probably second generation immigrants. Would that be a focus area for us? For you? Yeah,

S Speaker 216:48like I said, you know, we have to just make a case as to base some India, right? That's not really clear about

17:13do you keep coming to India?

do you keep coming to India?
do you keep coming to India?
S Speaker 117:16Probably late in December. It's been some time, but I plan to come this year sometime. Okay, I'm originally from Bangalore. Sorry. Ranji did my undergrad in Chennai and then worked in Bangalore. So I would come to Bangalore. If I come to India, I have a house there, so would definitely like to come there

17:40as well. For sure,
S Speaker 118:30exactly the reason why we started doing seed because seed round has flipped itself, has been inflated so much.
