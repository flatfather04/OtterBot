through your app? So what would the interaction be, again, like through your app? They would essentially be talking to a bot.
through your app? So what would the interaction be, again, like through your app? They would essentially be talking to a bot.
through your app? So what would the interaction be, again, like through your app? They would essentially be talking to a bot.
through your app? So what would the interaction be, again, like through your app? They would essentially be talking to a bot.
Speaker 2
I would say, in the app, we will have the onboarding progress. I would say,

I think small fleet archway, yes, because everything is about
I think small fleet archway, yes, because everything is about
I think small fleet archway, yes, because everything is about
I think small fleet archway, yes, because everything is about
Speaker 2
as well, I would say, like the onboarding and also kind of wallet. Thank you. Yeah, I was the other kind of wallet, wallet, onboarding and the wallet. So this is a agent system. It can have real time domain. Uber Eats has a bad access to DoorDash. They actually be able to order food for you. I didn't know what you want, and your loved ones order food for you. And it becomes so simple and you charge them extra team
as well, I would say, like the onboarding and also kind of wallet. Thank you. Yeah, I was the other kind of wallet, wallet, onboarding and the wallet. So this is a agent system. It can have real time domain. Uber Eats has a bad access to DoorDash. They actually be able to order food for you. I didn't know what you want, and your loved ones order food for you.

like, what? So the
onboarding experience would be
onboarding experience would be
onboarding experience would be
onboarding experience would be
Speaker 2
like figuring out what kind of what kind of view like, yeah, what kind of information you like, what kind of people they are,
like figuring out what kind of what kind of view like, yeah, what kind of information you like, what kind of people they are,
like figuring out what kind of what kind of view like, yeah, what kind of information you like, what kind of people they are,
like figuring out what kind of what kind of view like, yeah, what kind of information you like, what kind of people they are,
Speaker 1
knowing more about them, knowing more preferences, yeah, so we have
knowing more about them, knowing more preferences, yeah, so we have
knowing more about them, knowing more preferences, yeah, so we have
knowing more about them, knowing more preferences, yeah, so we have
Speaker 2

But I think, anyway, we need to eat, right? Anyway we need to eat. You always need to pay for the food, and it's just a little bit surgical. You may not care a lot, and because AI also provides and always have some someone order food, and you don't need to worry about them. Worry about, okay, it's 10pm orders all the access code and access to me, I mean that very simple, and it's not a standalone to the app. I think this brings additional value, and you can many people order one order per day for one company each month, they pay at least 30 to $60 it's only about more they can have schedule airplanes using other things for you, and you can imagine whatever you can put in now the air company can do or in the future, after they have been warped, I mean, agent, after they have been war With warp, with the promotion, or user can pay more for them. And when you have it becomes a big, beautiful platform, we can even begin negotiating with the provider.

talk more frequently as a larger model, and I think there will be something amazing. Will be the AI can choose when will be the day, for example, you first you need AI out of three months this month, if you spend a lot of time, yeah, I choose to send you some people, and you don't need to pay for that will be already spent.

We definitely see
a phone factor. So
Speaker 1
the question is whether it will take a form factor like that, or whether it will be a form factor, you know, like you may launch something, it didn't work, but the tech wasn't there. I think they were 30 for their time.

But a form factor,
Speaker 1
we are working with many large companies right now that are thinking about the future of AI
we are working with many large companies right now that are thinking about the future of AI
we are working with many large companies right now that are thinking about the future of AI
we are working with many large companies right now that are thinking about the future of AI
consumer in Iraq.
Speaker 1
On the hardware side, what factor does that take? Meta, as you know, is definitely thinking about glasses, but there are many other companies that are thinking about different form factor now. So what's interesting is they're definitely like a lot of companies are thinking about a form factor that is not a smartphone, because as and when your agent tech workflow becomes more and more predictable. You don't need a green as much click on a whole bunch of things. So

underlying pieces. And then
underlying pieces. And then
underlying pieces. And then
underlying pieces. And then
Speaker 1
I actually think there will be a space for actually new form factors, whether it'll be a glass or something else, it's hard to say, because that's a human behavior thing. Not everybody wants to wear a glass with cameras,
I actually think there will be a space for actually new form factors, whether it'll be a glass or something else, it's hard to say, because that's a human behavior thing. Not everybody wants to wear a glass with cameras,

and those behaviors take a long time to
and those behaviors take a long time to
and those behaviors take a long time to
and those behaviors take a long time to
become part of society. Yeah.
become part of society. Yeah.
become part of society. Yeah.

But, I mean, it's clear, like, you'll be like, the movie her, right? Yeah, the movie Her is a very real possibility. You, in fact, you're going to build, you're going after building something like that, yeah. Isn't that true? So, So now imagine the movie Her they show his mode of operation was mostly just the earbud. Yes, earbud and he had like a display, right? So what you're already seeing. So what we have is we have a standalone earbud that doesn't need to actually talk to so it's got its own connectivity, and it's got its own computer. So now that earbud can run AI models in itself, and it can talk to the cloud when it wants to without going to the phone. Fast forward two years. You're only going to see that increase. You're only going to see the power getting better. So then, in a world where gigantic AI becomes very common, very robust,
But, I mean, it's clear, like, you'll be like, the movie her, right? Yeah, the movie Her is a very real possibility.

More and more actually, voice will have a

More and more actually, voice will have a
More and more actually, voice will have a
Speaker 1
your bat is in the right space. Voice will have a bigger role to play, because I can see, I mean, the most of my interactions with chat GPT has used voice. I don't hear it back, because chat GPT is voice mode is not like, it's not good right now, like latency is high. Conversational it's not smart. The conversational part is not there. It's lacking a lot, yeah, so,
your bat is in the right space. Voice will have a bigger role to play, because I can see, I mean, the most of my interactions with chat GPT has used voice. I don't hear it back, because chat GPT is voice mode is not like, it's not good right now, like latency is high. Conversational it's not smart. The conversational part is not there.

So like 11 apps,
Speaker 2
right? Okay, boys, they are doing research. They do research, but they didn't optimize the engineering. They don't make it a worker, make it as an agent, and they just provide simple API like, I believe, manners and over AI tries to make it more, put more engineering effort to make AI be able to figure out more and more stuff. While there are some companies,

there is a depth function, COVID is all this kind of API and but if you go to their Japanese app, it doesn't work well. And, yeah, I think many people didn't realize the future of AI is not only about AI model. It's a combination of AI model and engineering. It needs to be a lot of engineering effort to make it called Real. Really called

the more complex, the more robot it is, generally, the harder it is to bother the interview like if you just want to use Windows, they get it's quite easy. There's a rapid image, very user friendly, but it doesn't allow you to do a lot in the kernel side doesn't value a lot of customization if you are doing agent piece system, there are so many APIs, so many stuff you can give access to agents. And it's not only about one token agent can solve. Can actually solve anything, and when the system becomes more and more complex, generally it's harder to use other API people transpire tend to buy solution. So I think a well known example is like Salesforce, all this kind of and when you are beginning Salesforce or zero confidence, so they sell you entire solution, and your ability to combine and change the code on your side almost never exists, because it's so COVID If you are not engineer inheritance. So I think engineering system will go to the same situation. So eventually every company will use some open source solution or some open app API, but maybe lower level API to do the engine tools themselves, instead of relying on Being Well designed again, system solution, there's no solution to all kinds of different use cases, and the better it's designed for some use case. Generally, the more it is for some other just like you don't want to put the chip in metal ribbon to your phone. It's pretty cheap, but you didn't put that in the phone.

Speaker 2
So I think in the future, maybe after few years, there may be some open source engineering system developed by a lot of large people, and I'll have a lot of integration, and it's support over air support and development support Gemini for all different kinds of models. But it will be something open source which finds only a lot of company.

Speaker 1
Arguments, yeah, I mean the argument is also the gap between open source and closed source. There's a huge gap right now. There's a big gap, yeah, but

The question is, does the gap closer one month?

I think they can get closer on application side, I mean,

I think they can get closer on application side, I mean,
I think they can get closer on application side, I mean,
Speaker 2
on the engineering side, but on the model side, maybe like the endeavors get closer. I mean, I don't want to call like QM or
on the engineering side, but on the model side, maybe like the endeavors get closer. I mean, I don't want to call like QM or
on the engineering side, but on the model side, maybe like the endeavors get closer. I mean, I don't want to call like QM or

I don't want to call them like deep thing. There's some rumor that deep thing are too,

I don't want to call them like deep thing. There's some rumor that deep thing are too,
I don't want to call them like deep thing. There's some rumor that deep thing are too,
Speaker 2
but I think we don't want to call them a kind of open source that everyone can use, because apparently you don't have eight 200 in your home, and the chip is hardware you want to want 5001 10k dollars. It will be the chip in hardware you can run deep on your home, in
but I think we don't want to call them a kind of open source that everyone can use, because apparently you don't have eight 200 in your home, and the chip is hardware you want to want 5001 10k dollars. It will be the chip in hardware you can run deep on your home, in

Speaker 1
your home, but that's okay. I mean, it's open source, so you're not paying for the model, but you're not paying for maybe you run it on AWS. I
your home, but that's okay. I mean, it's open source, so you're not paying for the model, but you're not paying for maybe you run it on AWS. I
your home, but that's okay. I mean, it's open source, so you're not paying for the model, but you're not paying for maybe you run it on AWS. I

Speaker 2
think the humor here is the model itself is kind of free, but it never open source, some kind of training data recipe, all you can see, which means, if you want to find in the model, even the base model is more strong enough, it becomes an issue. And I think that's a main reason why open source didn't catch up to like over AI or I believe, is a very good foundation model, and people can try to do more simply grow more is where they have the weight. But unfortunately, back is no because when they want, when someone wants to tune, you see,

they need to spend too much money.

Speaker 2
You need to at least have, I think for 550 you need to have at least four at 200 nodes. To budget, at least in red, it will be like 16 nodes. And where, if you walk the normal users, they don't want to rent that for one month, right? They go to AWS, it will be like $4 per hour per GPU.

imagine it's a regular. It's not cool, like us. We have a lot of connection. We have, like, use a month to month commitment. So our price is much lower than the only demand price. So if you only want to find the between the model

So imagine when experiment you just want to try, and they don't even know we will success. If you try that, we will take them 2000 3000 bucks to give a try. I mean, the open source, most people just don't do that. I'm okay, yeah, I'm done, because they are not rich. So

talking about the round.
talking about the round.
talking about the round.
talking about the round.
Speaker 1
I have one more open question that I need to answer, which is around So last time when we checked with our legal team around character, they said no for because of the role play. So that's something that I could and I was trying to understand how to position it because, like, so, for example, the Instagram has that pre COVID.
I have one more open question that I need to answer, which is around So last time when we checked with our legal team around character, they said no for because of the role play.

That's something that I need to why don't I do it today? I'll get Yeah, it doesn't work, yeah,
That's something that I need to why don't I do it today? I'll get Yeah, it doesn't work, yeah,

That's something that I need to why don't I do it today? I'll get Yeah, it doesn't work, yeah,
Speaker 1
if you're if it doesn't work, then I actually have some orientations that have just looked at character AI, yes, they've got a lot of good insight. If you're interested. I can actually

So, yeah, I think from our side, you know, all kind of software in the war, there eventually will be some user something,

Speaker 1
yeah, but, but I think the case here, so you're what you're going for. And I'm not saying that wrong, actually, I think that could be very compelling. I've never heard. And then what you're describing how AI eventually, because people will eventually get emotionally attached to AI, whether it's in a girlfriend, boyfriend role, whether it's in a therapist role, whether they're recovering from some other emotional setback.
yeah, but, but I think the case here, so you're what you're going for. And I'm not saying that wrong, actually, I think that could be very compelling. I've never heard.

so then, I mean, AI, ordering stuff for you actually could make sense, and people might have to be totally okay with it. In fact, they might be even more accurate.

So I think the case here is if we divide the software in the world, their kind of software are designed to make assets, and the software are not designed so by design, YouTube, tik, Tok, Instagram, they are not designed to make just like us, but character AI is basically care and Thai. From what do we know? They are designed to make, designed to make an SFW cover is part of the ecosystem, part of the system. The reason here is just like what we discussed. No hopefully, every time you spend your time, your effort, and you give information to the AI and AI response to the app, right?

Speaker 2
One part will be the story will be the end. Another part, if the story is only, if they are chatting with one character, and the character only has a limited number of story limited information after the user chat with the character for two weeks, because no no character writer, designer, can design character that has 100k words that are more content than people can consume in two weeks. What happens? How do they drive the retention? How do they drive users? Yeah, how that's finally what happened to them. Because they don't have additional content to keep users, they have to empty. What do you know? We have some internal data from Chai. You know, whenever they reduce the speed of NFW funding, they get significant more users and higher long

yeah, so I think the case was, is we always try to find a way to provide more information, to provide people feel more engaging. It's like in the real world, the world is not just about sex right when people can provide more emotional support and emotional attachment. I agree. I'm

if I wasn't a corporate investor, I would have invested right away. Thank you. So, yeah. So the only thing is I need to check, and then if we don't, if that doesn't happen, I'm gonna just check today. Yeah, there's one investor that I would introduce you to.

Hopefully they are happy with hope the lawyer figures out what's actually going on. Thank you, John. Yeah. Know that, because I also deal with some stuff with, you know, immediate story, but we are doing the data promoting. We are super careful about

and I get it. Why they do it? The reason why they do it is because you were building a model, yeah. But and for the right reasons, if you're grabbing images, either required for your training or whatever, right but the lawyers want to be over cautious, because they don't want any article from Wall Street Journal or, you know, information to come out that tarnishes the brand, which will have a much bigger impact on

exactly, there's no way that you can survive over the long term, If you want to build a long term company, so you're thinking about it the right way.

Speaker 2
brainstorm and think a lot about so we want to make it so if we believe the AI model is strong, we should believe most people can feel especially emotional connection with AI, then

companies, Google, Right, Tiktok, meta, they don't fucking charge, they don't charge, they act as an intermediate layer, as a platform, and they earn money from the business who want to, want to reach home, they're using. That's why we have the actually, we have the initial idea. So how do we, why do we want to make it be able to give your food? So in this case, usually maybe you can charge users, but or you, maybe you even don't charge you actually, you just earn zero for that, and later you can begin negotiating with Uber. Uber is, hey, if you don't let me do that, you don't give money. I will do that with storage action. That's a

charge creative restaurant, so you still charge for the food. Yeah, I charge just that, your fee, your 10% fee. Instead of charging user,

Speaker 2
you will charge from over all restaurants they want, whoever, yeah, but just not from user. And this makes people feel a lot easier. And I think, yeah, current AI companion, they're just so limited. Yeah, you know, third AI and they want to do dispute the body makes it smaller and smaller, cheaper and cheaper. I don't think that's the right way. The only the way is when you have so much users, you can convert them into long term user. And they begin attached to one to AI, and then it becomes the media. It becomes transport, where you can charge other business,
you will charge from over all restaurants they want, whoever, yeah, but just not from user. And this makes people feel a lot easier. And I think, yeah, current AI companion, they're just so limited.

1:02:59
I mean eventually, like, you know, two, three years from now, you can totally like, there'll be a million GPU data centers, very common, very common, and the cost will come down. The only thing is, I think the usage will also go on significant so then Jensen

if he faces competition.

1:04:04
performance that cost also 30 or they cost because they're smaller volume price even even though Google's making their own, which is Google not making Broadcom is making it for them. Yeah? So, so Broadcom as well has to make money, right? Yeah, and and then the volume is slow, so the price of one wafer that you get

so four don't work in the field. This is after you test all these components separately. The system actually gets put together at customer sites, and the system is getting put together. Four out of the 10 don't work. So that's because of the complexity of the system. But even then, Nvidia can maintain 80%

whether you know, like the story behind the b1 100 b2, figure, you know they, they delay the ship. Do you know what happens? So they add so many masks on the ship to correct it, because they push it, push a hammer. So eventually they do some even if they do, it consumes 601 Oh, wow. So it has some power leakage, all kinds of issues. So they have to, I think they have to clean up the design and do that again. And that's why they delay the delay.

some hard and it's hidden by the driver layer. So, so there's a joke like so the behavior AMD chip is actually correct. Excuse me. So if for some calculation, it should give you enough math is correct, but it hurts people's memory, and that mechanism fail because it really has cheap doesn't it's not correct. It gives you zero, but zeros make machine learning happy, and that's the reason, when they're using inviction, they can change that.

1:13:24
but I don't look at ai me. I don't want to look at the math problem. I don't even want to look at the problem. And I feel what the problem is. They like for the math competition, what the problem is? Say I'm not I'm minoring, I'm not major in math. But I don't know what the problem you say in many cases, and AI says I would get 94% and

So if they can remember, we can imagine the development of chemicals, the development of the, you know, all kind of measurement of significant, I think one foot length for human is also the memory. So what can never learn whatever. Learn all the knowledge in the world. No people. Nobody can do that, and that becomes our huge problem. So when we are thinking about something, it's very lucky. Someone else already that and have the result. But we have to do that again. If AI has the memory, it's

they give the transcription. And
from what this is the and
Speaker 2
it doesn't have enough information, as much information as our
you have transcription model,
Speaker 2
yeah, we will attribute data for Chinese speech model.
But do you also release that for
I would say like, release the API
another two, three weeks. Yeah, okay,
but you will release a speech to Texas on the corner,
Speaker 1
deep gram and assembly also have voice model, you know, assembly, AI to do. They also have voice model. I
know assembly, they both have voice
Speaker 1
okay. They have text speeches. Oh, so everybody is going in both directions,
yeah, but

ultimately, generally, you are only good at one direction.
Yeah, people,
yeah, that's right,

yeah, that's I mean, mostly that's what we used to see. But the question that we're asking is, is that changing now is even like speech to text?
I don't know. Did they ever release updates to whisper?
Speaker 2
Whisper? Yeah. Did they ever nobody nobody released. I mean, a model significantly better than.
Nobody released.
Speaker 2
A model significant better. I mean, nobody opens Oh,
Speaker 1
nobody opens up. Like, but what was there like, do they keep updating this?
No, right? No, I did.
Speaker 2
They up. They released some issue or terrible version after the reason. But it's not performance wise, significant better than
Speaker 1
but I'm guessing, like everybody like your speech to text is probably better than biscuits, right?
Yeah, yeah,
biscuits doesn't give you any emotion,
Speaker 2
and sometimes even didn't give you observation. Sometimes, oh, really, yeah. Trend on video or kind of movie cabinet, and then we'll see capturing this kind of
more Time with the menus. Yes, so
Give us some More.
Let's talk about
it not a lot of options. You
Speaker 1
I think I have the passage. What do you do on the
weekends? Coding good
right now I guess,
Speaker 3
two weeks around ready to grow up, I probably Wong in Guangdong. I'm Binu bangko. Last I was in
Guangdong was about eight
years ago I was in Guangdong,
Speaker 1
Oh, you. You haven't been to Guangzhou since then. Where's your Where are your parents? Apparently,
in Canada, yeah, in
Speaker 1
Quebec. Oh, there. Did they move? Yeah? Have
a younger brother,
so you move with them, 50 back, yeah,
Speaker 2
so I put in my all the way to Canada first. Yeah.
Speaker 1
That, yeah, so you grew up long ago, went to Canada, yeah,
growing on it. Then come here. You went to Burke, right.
Oh, you know, yeah.
I left okay, I left.
What were you working in at Nvidia?
Speaker 2
So I left. I also have one.
We create
Speaker 2
few petabytes, petabytes, and then we clean that. We do, Nvidia, large,
Nvidia, clean Nvidia from scratch,
both data spaghetti
Speaker 1
and have a Diet Coke. Okay, as well. Okay, for me ready to win, okay, and then I'll get a margarita with arugula. Margarita, arugula, yeah, maybe a maybe
Speaker 1
I'll get this hibiscus soda. Okay, is that sweet? It is sweet. Oh, do you have something that's not sweet?
Speaker 4
The least sweet one will be the grapefruit or the orange soda. I'll do
the orange Okay? Well,
Speaker 1
oh, then after Nvidia, why did you like choose voice?
Speaker 2
I think he was no voice three years ago. Oh, yeah, usually just Yeah, because I personally have been working on open source for seven years, eight years, yeah, since my first open source career. And two years ago, my ex girlfriend cheated, if you remember, then I decided to execute AI completing and which I found audio is a very important which is the recent component name,
and then that's
added Video. Were you in the research team? Or
Speaker 2
there's some story behind that. So what I was showing Nvidia is currently,
Speaker 2
so there's no headquarters in Nvidia research. Adlr, there's no headquarters. So my friend in Nvidia research and ADR, join me. Maybe you can go to our friends, friends team first and working on the topic. We so we work with immediate research team together to work on that topic, to work on the other project, and but not formally. You know,
Speaker 2
I joined that. While I joined that in, I think summer 2023 summer
Speaker 1
2023 did they have like, when was that trip? I think the Bitcoin mining dropped. Was it 23 I'm not
Speaker 2
sure. I think it's maybe PID con class pandemic. It's at the end of pandemic, and that they didn't reopen that yet.
Oh, so you were at Nvidia for only one year. Yeah,
Speaker 2
only one year. I think actually 11 months,
that was fast,
Speaker 2
after I finished, everything feel boring, because this super I think they have a lot of credit internally, and then people begin fighting for the credit. And
what credits so
like the contribution attribute
Speaker 2
you. People who joined the meeting three times want to plan the contribution, and if you don't give him, you just say your data doesn't look very, you know, secure to me. And the reason he think is not respecting the copyright is because Yvonne will scrape one website. The website is under the common for CC BY NC, sorry, CC BY so it allows you for allows you for commercial use, but the website store image from that doesn't allow that. So how do I know there's an image coming from another but it doesn't allow that. A lot
of things like that happen, and I just feel,
Speaker 2
ah, it's kind of boring, and yeah, and most importantly, it's time to be working on you see, the becomes more as confidential can be able to capture emotion. So it's time to throughout it. Wrong.
Speaker 1
Talk about, you know, what's next for you? You want to build a conversational AI move into that domain. And I think you want to do that in like a few months, right? And
then you want to stay in
personal company.
Speaker 2
So we need to cut our coffee power down. Real feedback from the Apoc. Be so
Speaker 2
These guys never send something
Speaker 2
to you, and it always wait for your for you to send them, then he or she replied. I mean, maybe usually is you see his or her picture. Okay, so nice. I want to chat with and chat it with her for, say, one two weeks. Yeah, you are tired. Yeah, you don't want to push the religions by yourself every time. And the people who are talking kind of, there's no story behind there's no knowledge, no information. It's just kind of boring. And so watching the bike, basically, we also get, yeah, also get information, and then push that, as you said, to start trading solutions more like a natural relationship. And then this will be the core part, and another part will be also very crucial. Will be the voice interaction. So voice.
So from
younger people, kind of,
Speaker 2
yeah, kind of young couple. They have a young one, young couple, young people, they tend to call others or have the FaceTime or video call open all the day. Yeah, a lot of people are doing
Speaker 1
that. Like, what? Like they turn on camera, or they don't try to
leave the phone there and just calling all the day. Oh, really,
Speaker 2
maybe running
Speaker 2
Speaker 1
through your app? So what would the interaction be, again, like through your app? They would essentially be talking to a bot.
Speaker 2
I would say, in the app, we will have the onboarding progress. I would say,
Speaker 4
I think small fleet archway, yes, because everything is about
Speaker 2
as well, I would say, like the onboarding and also kind of wallet. Thank you. Yeah, I was the other kind of wallet, wallet, onboarding and the wallet. So this is a agent system. It can have real time domain. Uber Eats has a bad access to DoorDash. They actually be able to order food for you. I didn't know what you want, and your loved ones order food for you. And it becomes so simple and you charge them extra team
like, what? So the
onboarding experience would be
Speaker 2
like figuring out what kind of what kind of view like, yeah, what kind of information you like, what kind of people they are,
Speaker 1
knowing more about them, knowing more preferences, yeah, so we have
Speaker 2
Speaker 1
and then, but, but the experience that you talked about, you know this, AI girlfriend, AI girlfriend, which is they will essentially have a bot running all the time, like You mentioned, like these days people wanna but the app is on all the time. What is it like? What's the experience like? Because the app
is running on a mobile
Speaker 1
phone right on through I message or Yeah,
Speaker 2
everything should be processed in the back end. All about application should be minimized. It has a phone call, like message, basic formatting in apps, and then the core is onboarding as wallet, but everything, maybe it will be pretty lightweight, but we can the user. Can use any kind of entry point or any kind of intervention walk and
Speaker 1
then you could do it like people. Can also create personas like therapist, or what have you like,
like a therapist, AI therapist,
AI therapy, yeah, I think a
Speaker 2
clear companion can definitely provide some AI therapy, emotional support. And I think important part for AI many research, or many people already find that is AI actually makes people feel more positive as well. Becomes more great because they don't feel long. They can communicate.
And chili oil
Speaker 2
and generally AI doesn't like they encourage fire. They encourage users to do some positives, to move in a positive way. And in this kind of situation, most people who use AI something else become better people and have even better and more healthy social connection
and in the back end, the LLM is still
Open AI or graphic.
What about like the
Speaker 1
the actual content. So, like,
Speaker 2
you know how large try or have no, I don't
know, give a number, get
enough, since you're asking small,
like billion parameters a billion,
like 7 million, 10 million,
Speaker 2
so I think they have the dispute version of 10 million, and now they have a try. For users,
Speaker 2
I think they do pretty well in role play. And role play is actually many times a harder task, comparing to chat, because it needs to write the scan in a very diverse way. It needs to be worked like an artist or writer,
Speaker 1
but their engagement numbers were very high. Are they still high? Numbers like people end up spending hours on those, right? Yeah,
they still do, yeah,
spend more time on the
chat model itself, instead of
Speaker 1
character had lot of distillation on quantization. I mean, they
they really wanted because the problem was serving
last year is only
50 million. Oh, really. Ai.
Speaker 2
That's why the engines are so many to still. Otherwise, you can imagine their use of
volume. The usage is free. So
how would you convert for this
conversational use case to
like radio, because
Speaker 1
on your API product or on your studio product, you know
you're seeing pretty good traction, yeah.
So how do you get similar number of growth on
we are going to do
make the first monthly and make it
look great. First month Great, yeah, and make it look good.
Speaker 2
And And ideally, we don't even want to charge users for a subscription or monthly fee. We want them to pay by service. So say your girlfriend order you some people.
Speaker 2
like 10 20% from the food order, the AI order home people generally doesn't care about the food is like 10% because it happens every day. And
this we have $30 alpha tax
Speaker 1
in the food order. Use Case, can you like? Why is the AI ordering food for you?
So yeah, in
Speaker 2
reality, boyfriend or girlfriend order food for each other.
But do you think like humans? Because in that case,
Speaker 1
in this case, the money is actually coming out of your pocket, like if your AI girlfriend orders food for you,
the money is coming from you.
Speaker 2
But I think, anyway, we need to eat, right? Anyway we need to eat. You always need to pay for the food, and it's just a little bit surgical. You may not care a lot, and because AI also provides and always have some someone order food, and you don't need to worry about them. Worry about, okay, it's 10pm orders all the access code and access to me, I mean that very simple, and it's not a standalone to the app. I think this brings additional value, and you can many people order one order per day for one company each month, they pay at least 30 to $60 it's only about more they can have schedule airplanes using other things for you, and you can imagine whatever you can put in now the air company can do or in the future, after they have been warped, I mean, agent, after they have been war With warp, with the promotion, or user can pay more for them. And when you have it becomes a big, beautiful platform, we can even begin negotiating with the provider. So the user actually may not pay anything but we prepare, or the user doesn't pay anything but we get get this car from air, pet,
a lot of heroin you have to climb on. We have the Eco cheese.
I think it is way better than making a subscription.
Speaker 5
Oh yeah, because I see where they're going with it.
In fact,
Speaker 1
getting a subscription might be a friction, yeah,
so we don't want
Speaker 2
them to if they really don't want to spend any money, you guys want air to for the food.
Speaker 2
However, there should be the there should be an internal credit system, internal what credit system? So if the user is very, very kind of inactive and doesn't want to pay anything, we should
reduce the service
Speaker 2
like GP. Everyone is GP, for all, when you are in the Pro user, five user, free user, you have different kind of product.
Spend more time, more money on AI if you able to
Speaker 2
talk more frequently as a larger model, and I think there will be something amazing. Will be the AI can choose when will be the day, for example, you first you need AI out of three months this month, if you spend a lot of time, yeah, I choose to send you some people, and you don't need to pay for that will be already spent. And there
Speaker 1
is time are character and Chai already also doing something similar or no. The
Speaker 2
What do you think will be the future of human and AI fashion?
I think it would be wearable,
maybe awesome glasses wearable.
We definitely see
a phone factor. So
Speaker 1
the question is whether it will take a form factor like that, or whether it will be a form factor, you know, like you may launch something, it didn't work, but the tech wasn't there. I think they were 30 for their time.
But a form factor,
Speaker 1
we are working with many large companies right now that are thinking about the future of AI
consumer in Iraq.
Speaker 1
On the hardware side, what factor does that take? Meta, as you know, is definitely thinking about glasses, but there are many other companies that are thinking about different form factor now. So what's interesting is they're definitely like a lot of companies are thinking about a form factor that is not a smartphone, because as and when your agent tech workflow becomes more and more predictable. You don't need a green as much click on a whole bunch of things. So
that's the
underlying pieces. And then
Speaker 1
I actually think there will be a space for actually new form factors, whether it'll be a glass or something else, it's hard to say, because that's a human behavior thing. Not everybody wants to wear a glass with cameras,
and those behaviors take a long time to
become part of society. Yeah.
Speaker 1
But, I mean, it's clear, like, you'll be like, the movie her, right? Yeah, the movie Her is a very real possibility. You, in fact, you're going to build, you're going after building something like that, yeah. Isn't that true? So, So now imagine the movie Her they show his mode of operation was mostly just the earbud. Yes, earbud and he had like a display, right? So what you're already seeing. So what we have is we have a standalone earbud that doesn't need to actually talk to so it's got its own connectivity, and it's got its own computer. So now that earbud can run AI models in itself, and it can talk to the cloud when it wants to without going to the phone. Fast forward two years. You're only going to see that increase. You're only going to see the power getting better. So then, in a world where gigantic AI becomes very common, very robust,
just say the word, and things just happen.
Speaker 1
Then people are going to want to talk to a nice voice.
More and more actually, voice will have a
Speaker 1
your bat is in the right space. Voice will have a bigger role to play, because I can see, I mean, the most of my interactions with chat GPT has used voice. I don't hear it back, because chat GPT is voice mode is not like, it's not good right now, like latency is high. Conversational it's not smart. The conversational part is not there. It's lacking a lot, yeah, so,
but definitely, I think,
voice whether it's through your phone, voice whether it's
Speaker 1
through an earbud, a voice, whether it's through glasses, it's going to be everything. So you had a meeting with our XR guy, right? Yeah, yeah. How did that go?
Yeah, yeah,
Speaker 1
we're definitely, I mean, if you think about it like, like companies use, I think we talked about it, what's the name of sesame? For example, you already know they, they're working on a glass as well.
So their plan is conquer
conversational AI first,
Speaker 1
on PC or smartphone first, and then put that in a glass. So their vision is that people will not need a smartphone. Eventually, they will be so deep and talk to an agent, but they'll need a glass. That's their plan. They already have
it, but
Speaker 2
I feel for some reason, many companies who have great capability, great models, that baby model
didn't take a big step of engineers.
So like 11 apps,
Speaker 2
right? Okay, boys, they are doing research. They do research, but they didn't optimize the engineering. They don't make it a worker, make it as an agent, and they just provide simple API like, I believe, manners and over AI tries to make it more, put more engineering effort to make AI be able to figure out more and more stuff. While there are some companies,
Speaker 2
there is a depth function, COVID is all this kind of API and but if you go to their Japanese app, it doesn't work well. And, yeah, I think many people didn't realize the future of AI is not only about AI model. It's a combination of AI model and engineering. It needs to be a lot of engineering effort to make it called Real. Really called
Speaker 6
agent Twister. So,
Speaker 1
but I think, don't you like? What do you think like? Does that become commodity as well? Something
like building like a man who say, does that
become commodity? Mean, which
Speaker 1
is the tech to build robust Asian tech
system so that
become like open AI is just
Speaker 2
going to make it available or where we will definitely try to make it available, but, but
Speaker 1
when you are integrating, I'm not talking about your your stuff. I don't think open air is going to go after as much
we are talking about a Swiss company,
Speaker 2
the more complex, the more robot it is, generally, the harder it is to bother the interview like if you just want to use Windows, they get it's quite easy. There's a rapid image, very user friendly, but it doesn't allow you to do a lot in the kernel side doesn't value a lot of customization if you are doing agent piece system, there are so many APIs, so many stuff you can give access to agents. And it's not only about one token agent can solve. Can actually solve anything, and when the system becomes more and more complex, generally it's harder to use other API people transpire tend to buy solution. So I think a well known example is like Salesforce, all this kind of and when you are beginning Salesforce or zero confidence, so they sell you entire solution, and your ability to combine and change the code on your side almost never exists, because it's so COVID If you are not engineer inheritance. So I think engineering system will go to the same situation. So eventually every company will use some open source solution or some open app API, but maybe lower level API to do the engine tools themselves, instead of relying on Being Well designed again, system solution, there's no solution to all kinds of different use cases, and the better it's designed for some use case. Generally, the more it is for some other just like you don't want to put the chip in metal ribbon to your phone. It's pretty cheap, but you didn't put that in the phone.
Speaker 2
So I think in the future, maybe after few years, there may be some open source engineering system developed by a lot of large people, and I'll have a lot of integration, and it's support over air support and development support Gemini for all different kinds of models. But it will be something open source which finds only a lot of company.
Speaker 1
Arguments, yeah, I mean the argument is also the gap between open source and closed source. There's a huge gap right now. There's a big gap, yeah, but
I mean right now you could argue that the gap is one year.
The question is, does the gap closer one month?
I think they can get closer on application side, I mean,
Speaker 2
on the engineering side, but on the model side, maybe like the endeavors get closer. I mean, I don't want to call like QM or
Speaker 1
I don't want to call them like deep thing. There's some rumor that deep thing are too,
Speaker 2
but I think we don't want to call them a kind of open source that everyone can use, because apparently you don't have eight 200 in your home, and the chip is hardware you want to want 5001 10k dollars. It will be the chip in hardware you can run deep on your home, in
Speaker 1
your home, but that's okay. I mean, it's open source, so you're not paying for the model, but you're not paying for maybe you run it on AWS. I
Speaker 2
think the humor here is the model itself is kind of free, but it never open source, some kind of training data recipe, all you can see, which means, if you want to find in the model, even the base model is more strong enough, it becomes an issue. And I think that's a main reason why open source didn't catch up to like over AI or I believe, is a very good foundation model, and people can try to do more simply grow more is where they have the weight. But unfortunately, back is no because when they want, when someone wants to tune, you see,
they need to spend too much money.
Speaker 2
You need to at least have, I think for 550 you need to have at least four at 200 nodes. To budget, at least in red, it will be like 16 nodes. And where, if you walk the normal users, they don't want to rent that for one month, right? They go to AWS, it will be like $4 per hour per GPU.
And Well, now you can get it for,
now you can get it for like,
five, two or three. Yeah, I don't have
Speaker 2
imagine it's a regular. It's not cool, like us. We have a lot of connection. We have, like, use a month to month commitment. So our price is much lower than the only demand price. So if you only want to find the between the model
Speaker 4
for one day taking your time. Or can I take this plate out your way? You can take mine? Yeah.
Speaker 2
So imagine when experiment you just want to try, and they don't even know we will success. If you try that, we will take them 2000 3000 bucks to give a try. I mean, the open source, most people just don't do that. I'm okay, yeah, I'm done, because they are not rich. So
talking about the round.
Speaker 1
I have one more open question that I need to answer, which is around So last time when we checked with our legal team around character, they said no for because of the role play. So that's something that I could and I was trying to understand how to position it because, like, so, for example, the Instagram has that pre COVID.
That's something that I need to why don't I do it today? I'll get Yeah, it doesn't work, yeah,
Speaker 1
if you're if it doesn't work, then I actually have some orientations that have just looked at character AI, yes, they've got a lot of good insight. If you're interested. I can actually
done a lot. I've read their cases
that space well.
Speaker 1
Much, but I would like to actually first compare. I like it. I think.
Speaker 2
So, yeah, I think from our side, you know, all kind of software in the war, there eventually will be some user something,
Speaker 1
yeah, but, but I think the case here, so you're what you're going for. And I'm not saying that wrong, actually, I think that could be very compelling. I've never heard. And then what you're describing how AI eventually, because people will eventually get emotionally attached to AI, whether it's in a girlfriend, boyfriend role, whether it's in a therapist role, whether they're recovering from some other emotional setback.
He people will get emotionally attached to AI because
Speaker 1
AIs are going to be just much better in terms of, I mean, it
could also be scary, but at the same time AI,
Speaker 1
so then, I mean, AI, ordering stuff for you actually could make sense, and people might have to be totally okay with it. In fact, they might be even more accurate.
Speaker 2
So I think the case here is if we divide the software in the world, their kind of software are designed to make assets, and the software are not designed so by design, YouTube, tik, Tok, Instagram, they are not designed to make just like us, but character AI is basically care and Thai. From what do we know? They are designed to make, designed to make an SFW cover is part of the ecosystem, part of the system. The reason here is just like what we discussed. No hopefully, every time you spend your time, your effort, and you give information to the AI and AI response to the app, right?
What's the reason keep user keep user engagement?
Speaker 2
One part will be the story will be the end. Another part, if the story is only, if they are chatting with one character, and the character only has a limited number of story limited information after the user chat with the character for two weeks, because no no character writer, designer, can design character that has 100k words that are more content than people can consume in two weeks. What happens? How do they drive the retention? How do they drive users? Yeah, how that's finally what happened to them. Because they don't have additional content to keep users, they have to empty. What do you know? We have some internal data from Chai. You know, whenever they reduce the speed of NFW funding, they get significant more users and higher long
Speaker 5
term Chai. Also, if you go to the App Store, yeah, they're essentially selling, yeah.
Yeah, they changed, yeah, before it was
a lot of it,
Speaker 2
yeah, so I think the case was, is we always try to find a way to provide more information, to provide people feel more engaging. It's like in the real world, the world is not just about sex right when people can provide more emotional support and emotional attachment. I agree. I'm
Speaker 1
not saying that the wrong or right, but
Speaker 2
Had to figure
out with our
Speaker 1
teams, because we're corporate, our team, our lawyers, tend to be more shit,
but I I think you,
Speaker 1
if I wasn't a corporate investor, I would have invested right away. Thank you. So, yeah. So the only thing is I need to check, and then if we don't, if that doesn't happen, I'm gonna just check today. Yeah, there's one investor that I would introduce you to.
He's smart, so
they've spent a lot of time in this space.
They looked at character AI very deeply.
Okay, I would,
I would have interested
but let me check. I want to still check.
Speaker 2
Hopefully they are happy with hope the lawyer figures out what's actually going on. Thank you, John. Yeah. Know that, because I also deal with some stuff with, you know, immediate story, but we are doing the data promoting. We are super careful about
what the challenge is,
Speaker 1
and I get it. Why they do it? The reason why they do it is because you were building a model, yeah. But and for the right reasons, if you're grabbing images, either required for your training or whatever, right but the lawyers want to be over cautious, because they don't want any article from Wall Street Journal or, you know, information to come out that tarnishes the brand, which will have a much bigger impact on
their stock,
Speaker 1
right? So that's the same view that our lawyers have, which is our lawyers say your small investment should have no impact, potential impact on the brand, yeah, so they'll be over cautious, yeah, that's the
that's the only thing but,
Speaker 1
but I think, I mean the good news, I think you're thinking about it the right way, which is my thesis, is that you have to go Home the customer in this world, in this AI world, if you end up becoming a layer between your customers, then
that'll be like, then you'll be
Speaker 1
exactly, there's no way that you can survive over the long term, If you want to build a long term company, so you're thinking about it the right way. And then that wedge, also I do like, and then your angle is different. And where did you get all these like, what's the like? How did you think about these ideas? Or, Why do you want, like, how do you want to charge?
So we actually
Speaker 2
brainstorm and think a lot about so we want to make it so if we believe the AI model is strong, we should believe most people can feel especially emotional connection with AI, then
we will go back to check, especially
Speaker 2
in the internet, all kind of companies which become a huge
company, the top
Speaker 2
companies, Google, Right, Tiktok, meta, they don't fucking charge, they don't charge, they act as an intermediate layer, as a platform, and they earn money from the business who want to, want to reach home, they're using. That's why we have the actually, we have the initial idea. So how do we, why do we want to make it be able to give your food? So in this case, usually maybe you can charge users, but or you, maybe you even don't charge you actually, you just earn zero for that, and later you can begin negotiating with Uber. Uber is, hey, if you don't let me do that, you don't give money. I will do that with storage action. That's a
Speaker 1
so that's definitely an interesting thing,
charging without ads, yeah, and it can actually
Speaker 1
charge creative restaurant, so you still charge for the food. Yeah, I charge just that, your fee, your 10% fee. Instead of charging user,
Speaker 2
you will charge from over all restaurants they want, whoever, yeah, but just not from user. And this makes people feel a lot easier. And I think, yeah, current AI companion, they're just so limited. Yeah, you know, third AI and they want to do dispute the body makes it smaller and smaller, cheaper and cheaper. I don't think that's the right way. The only the way is when you have so much users, you can convert them into long term user. And they begin attached to one to AI, and then it becomes the media. It becomes transport, where you can charge other business,
you will get more money from the app.
Speaker 2
in the impact
process, you
don't get ideas. We
Speaker 2
always say you are right. Yes, it will, you're right. That's absolutely right. It will
never challenge you. Never challenge you.
It will challenge you, although,
Speaker 1
if you ask it, hey, you have to criticize this. Criticize
this to pieces, yes, and
then we will try to
Speaker 2
whatever something even doesn't make any sense, yeah, sometimes, sometimes,
Speaker 2
a lot you know of programming or math just kind of very, they have a very, very objective answer.
1:00:03
So actually,
Speaker 2
1:00:08
he should, I really like their deep research. I like that a lot, especially when I was in the field. I don't know it works, I think pretty well, until one day I asked you to research some I know, yeah, yeah, it becomes so shitty, like it doesn't get the right information, and it gets some basic information, and you lack a lot so well, when I was asking some new research topics and or some research idea I just had and asked The deep research, and it can't tell me if anyone did that before, or how this idea goes. It doesn't give me a What about grog deep research?
1:00:49
I didn't try Brock,
Speaker 2
1:00:50
but I always tried Gemini. Gemini has an even stronger housing.
Speaker 1
1:00:55
Gemini, yeah, Gemini. Last I checked, tried Gemini. Deep research, again, was a month ago, and it was definitely chat. GPT, deep research was better, but grok, the only problem with grog is it's lot more overdose. But on some topics, Grog does more deep research, what I've seen is that it'll go through a lot more sources. So the answers on grok, sometimes surprisingly,
1:01:28
what I've heard is grok 3.5
1:01:33
deep research mode especially, is going
Speaker 1
1:01:36
to be even more because they added more GPUs to Colossus. So I mean, it's a function of adding more GPUs, really power of money. That's it is the power
1:01:48
of money. I think they also have a mini
1:01:52
model that will release, meaning
1:01:55
by mini faster. I think it's a much smaller
Speaker 2
1:01:57
model. And we have some friends.
Speaker 1
1:02:03
But why would you use mini? Like, why would you ever use mini unless you didn't want something basic fast?
Speaker 2
1:02:10
I think when we talk about so you want the model to maintain the man will flow. Should be pretty intelligent. Know what he's doing, yeah, but you also need some Asian agent to summarize each article. And this should be some basic tasks.
1:02:30
But like for my deep research task,
1:02:34
I always, always want to use, like, biggest, baddest,
Speaker 2
1:02:37
yeah. I think nowadays deep research, I think when you are using, say, oh, three model for deep research, yes, they use that to plan the workflow, etc, and they use a random smaller model, somewhere in jargon, to cut down the cost. It's
1:02:55
probably pretty expensive, yeah.
Speaker 1
1:02:59
I mean eventually, like, you know, two, three years from now, you can totally like, there'll be a million GPU data centers, very common, very common, and the cost will come down. The only thing is, I think the usage will also go on significant so then Jensen
1:03:23
can cut on the price.
Speaker 1
1:03:26
He knows what he got. So Jensen will only cut price
1:03:32
if he faces competition.
Speaker 2
1:03:33
But I think the issue is, if he doesn't cut up price eventually, over AI as a likely to lose in the competition, comparing to, you
1:03:47
know, as a Google Keep you
Speaker 1
1:03:50
the only thing is CPU cannot. They cannot make that scale. So even Google is deploying a lot of GPU,
Speaker 2
1:03:56
right? So, so say if Yvette should be $30,000 for Google to reach the same
Speaker 1
1:04:04
performance that cost also 30 or they cost because they're smaller volume price even even though Google's making their own, which is Google not making Broadcom is making it for them. Yeah? So, so Broadcom as well has to make money, right? Yeah, and and then the volume is slow, so the price of one wafer that you get
Speaker 2
1:04:29
is much more expensive. Makes their own chip design, and
Speaker 1
1:04:33
only chip design, but manufactured by manufacturing, but
1:04:39
manufacturing and
Speaker 1
1:04:42
wafer design that's broad, and then Broadcom gives it to TSMC for manufacturing.
1:04:48
Actually, media has like 80% margin,
1:04:51
yeah, because, that's
1:04:54
because their volumes. Keep in mind, the volume is so much,
Speaker 1
1:04:58
the volume is so much everybody's buying, right? So I heard someone
Speaker 2
1:05:02
else immediately. I've heard some people say so even AMD is manufacturing the same level of chip as us. When we ate 80 90% of
Speaker 1
1:05:13
money they earned it like the only problem so AMD is catching up. Yeah, AMD problem is on the hardware, and now Jensen has made a lot added even more complexity. So you saw his last GCP, yeah, showing all these optical switches, and they added more copper black,
Speaker 5
1:05:38
yeah. So they've added, like, a lot of more, like a lot more complexity. So now Amy doesn't have a lot of that. However,
1:05:48
whatever media is struggling to because now the system has become so complex,
1:05:56
only six out of the 10 work,
Speaker 1
1:05:59
so four don't work in the field. This is after you test all these components separately. The system actually gets put together at customer sites, and the system is getting put together. Four out of the 10 don't work. So that's because of the complexity of the system. But even then, Nvidia can maintain 80%
Speaker 2
1:06:26
whether you know, like the story behind the b1 100 b2, figure, you know they, they delay the ship. Do you know what happens? So they add so many masks on the ship to correct it, because they push it, push a hammer. So eventually they do some even if they do, it consumes 601 Oh, wow. So it has some power leakage, all kinds of issues. So they have to, I think they have to clean up the design and do that again. And that's why they delay the delay.
Speaker 1
1:07:01
They still have a lot of issues. Yeah, they still have lot of bugs and
Speaker 2
1:07:04
issues, because the complex will become much higher. It's so crazy complexity.
Speaker 1
1:07:09
And so Nvidia has that problem right now. AMD is actually software stack is getting better than before. So AMD is biggest problem was the software stack was just kind of, yeah, so now it's getting better, and then the CUDA. So imagine these AI coding tools that become sober. So imagine in a world theoretically. So right now, in order for you to go to hardware, you write something in Python that gets converted to C plus plus c, and then assembly and all that, right?
1:07:51
And then who the libraries and C.
Speaker 1
1:07:55
Imagine if you could go from description of what you want English to assembly, all of this stuff in the middle gone, because you don't need to understand, no human needs to understand the book anymore, machines anymore. In the true agentic world, you don't need it. I mean, that's the theory, right? But Is that possible? I mean, that's possible. Actually, I already know
1:08:24
some people who ran this experiment
Speaker 1
1:08:28
of just collapsing everything and then this sort of language to assembly, small experiments just already seem to be working. So, so if, if that's going to work, then, then, essentially has
Speaker 2
1:08:52
some hard and it's hidden by the driver layer. So, so there's a joke like so the behavior AMD chip is actually correct. Excuse me. So if for some calculation, it should give you enough math is correct, but it hurts people's memory, and that mechanism fail because it really has cheap doesn't it's not correct. It gives you zero, but zeros make machine learning happy, and that's the reason, when they're using inviction, they can change that. But when they're using AMD, they come because AMD and so they have to add some cache to align with the behavior of CUDA. You know, the thing is,
1:09:41
but Jensen knows all this, yeah,
1:09:45
1:09:48
I'm sure he's working on other boats,
1:09:51
yeah, because he works with all
Speaker 1
1:09:53
The startups, yeah, directly. So I think I would still bet on Nvidia to keep leading the charge.
Speaker 2
1:10:08
Oh, that's a high charge a lot, but that charge is
Speaker 1
1:10:12
1:11:05
if that's not true,
Speaker 1
1:11:09
and there's no evidence that shows that it's true, right? Now, we don't have any any evidence that's true, right? Like all the evidence points in the direction that you throw more compute, more data, these systems keep getting better, yeah, and that's true for the last 10 years. It's still true, right? Yeah, we will always figure out some new technique, like, you know, deeply, test time, compute, right? Like, last year, remember, like, everybody was like, Oh, these models are
1:11:41
as in, COVID, Rob, like, the queen of
Speaker 2
1:11:44
the guy in meta, AI just come and say, Hey, AI is a wrong way. They can't reflect. You can't do anything. They can't correct error. The attribute error is high, and then all three comes out. Oh, one comes out, same. You know, AI can actually reflect and correct ever before. People keep finding ways to make it even more intelligent. I think in two years, though, we don't, people didn't see a way to make AI. So high score in mathematics, program and program and growth. I think for us, we as a human, we already lack most 99.9% people are way worse than AI or solving math problems. You have a specific goal. Do you have a specific one? I mean, if the goal is clear and you just need to solve this correctly, solve these problems, 99.9% of engineers or people who study math already way more than AI.
1:12:46
Yeah, that's
1:12:48
which is
Speaker 2
1:12:50
mind blowing. It's mind blowing. Whenever I see it's doing a little hard, I feel mind blowing because it takes me like 10 minutes to figure out the solution, and as a one second, I begin thinking. After 10 seconds, I finished, I
1:13:07
finished the rebound, and the 30 seconds is hot.
1:13:15
Someone like me would not even look at me for the heart.
1:13:22
It's kind of hard,
Speaker 2
1:13:24
but I don't look at ai me. I don't want to look at the math problem. I don't even want to look at the problem. And I feel what the problem is. They like for the math competition, what the problem is? Say I'm not I'm minoring, I'm not major in math. But I don't know what the problem you say in many cases, and AI says I would get 94% and
1:13:53
so I guess, yeah. So I think
Speaker 1
1:13:57
AI systems by the end of this year, yeah, many, many of these tabs, AI systems will start getting much more superior than you, and then you're saying 10 seconds. This only gets better, sub milliseconds, so even latency gets shorter.
Speaker 2
1:14:20
The only issue they want to solve is maybe, I think the memory, the long term memory, if that gets off, it will become huge. AI can, what
Speaker 1
1:14:31
do you think? Like, hard, like, I think about it as well, which is, you know, converting.
Speaker 2
1:14:37
Speaker 1
1:15:11
think that will be the vector, biggest vector of growth. Yeah, you think that will be the vector that's that's where, right now, AI models are significantly interior, yeah, they don't remember, yeah.
Speaker 2
1:15:28
So if they can remember, we can imagine the development of chemicals, the development of the, you know, all kind of measurement of significant, I think one foot length for human is also the memory. So what can never learn whatever. Learn all the knowledge in the world. No people. Nobody can do that, and that becomes our huge problem. So when we are thinking about something, it's very lucky. Someone else already that and have the result. But we have to do that again. If AI has the memory, it's
1:16:01
incredible. It Yeah, that'll be,
Speaker 1
1:16:05
I mean, that'll be a game changer for that's a super attack, because imagine, like, you know, mostly in discovery is typically, like a lot, most of the researchers in any domain,
1:16:21
a lot of them, they would go,
Speaker 1
1:16:23
like the researcher in physics will read a lot about biology and chemistry. And typically, new inventions happen when they
1:16:35
when they go discover new domains. Yeah, and then
Speaker 1
1:16:42
imagine, an AI system that knows about every single domain on the planet, then the pace of new discoveries. But anyway, so we let me, oh, it's already one, yeah, we find a coffee nearby. I
1:17:04
had to go, but, yeah,
Speaker 1
1:17:09
let me talk to our lawyers today. Yeah, I'll
1:17:13
get back, and then
Speaker 1
1:17:15
hopefully they're fine. If they're not fine, yeah,
1:17:20
you should talk to this investor. Yeah, they're very
1:17:26
good. They know a lot about this thing, okay, but hey, good stuff. Yeah, thank
Speaker 7
1:17:39
you. The mobile BU, call got canceled, yeah,
1:17:50
they were supposed to talk to
Speaker 1
1:17:54
mobile view right after This
1:17:57
mobile Okay, I think
1:18:00
we need to get here.
1:18:20
Out of the can we position?
Speaker 7
1:18:37
It? Not as loud. AI assistant marketed, then this
1:18:40
man just gets marketed shows up, he's definitely
1:18:49
very driven by that. Definitely
Speaker 1
1:18:58
good for him, the economic him.
1:19:08
I mean, I don't want to have a backlash,
1:19:15
because otherwise, like the
1:19:18
Texas beach part, is commodity. Yeah.
1:19:23
Even for I don't know what happened.
Speaker 7
1:19:30
That's like the first piece of his entire system, like, that's the UI part of it on the back end. And he has a good
1:19:38
company, honestly, from,
Speaker 1
1:19:44
1:20:04
year, and they can do It their distribution.
1:20:10
I mean, we should get back
Speaker 7
1:20:20
there. I mean, we should get back. Do you want me to work with them, positioning it as a
1:20:33
boy, he's truthful like that's why I met him today again, but he kept going after
1:20:42
how? Like we can. I don't want to twist things. So it is what it is. Let's
Speaker 1
1:20:55
find others. I looked at your physical AI stuff. I have to read it in more detail. I'll get back to
1:21:01
you. I'll put an update on that. On
Speaker 1
1:21:02
this, any other good stuff? There's a lot of these voice ones, this, whisper, flow. Have you heard how they're doing? I can talk to Tanay again. I've looked at them again. There's a bunch of companies in that space. They're just fast beach ones. I don't know if they're any good. Like, like, you talk to your you know, you instead of typing, you replace typing. And then you know how open AI is, like, right? Like, opening a when you use the Speech Mode, it's not just, it's not just text to speech. It also cleans up your text.
1:21:37
But some of these are,
Speaker 1
1:21:42
take, to the other step. They even refine it even more. But I don't think like that as well. But
Speaker 7
1:21:53
computer use, so lot of browser use agents, but I've made a good team style. To set up a follow up call there in the Stanford calculator right now. We'll be raising in a month or two, but the tech is in that space. It barely works today. There's a lot of iteration similar. It's computer tech. And then,
1:22:22
have you? Have you come across this company, anything?
Speaker 7
1:22:28
Company, quite active in the open source today. They are 100k weekly active users, but now trying, they have a desktop app for rad based system, which will work on your desktop, and LLM, which works on your desktop. Not all of the work. They work with Qualcomm. For some they've connected DevRel team as well. So this company in LM studio, two companies. So
1:23:26
I wonder if I talk to them, probably not, because I spoke to
Speaker 7
1:23:30
him last week. He hasn't spoken to the adventure
1:23:35
stage. Okay, we can talk.
1:23:38
I think Sergio spoke with a
1:23:40
pretty Fauci he
Speaker 1
1:23:43
forwarded me the meeting, but I read Timothy, yes, no way we are gonna do this. I can't respect the
Speaker 5
1:24:20
will need to happen that in itself, is a black
1:24:27
guy. If you have to do
1:24:30
that, nobody's gonna do it
1:24:35
and welcome, trust
1:24:40
me, A lawyer You headed To.
1:26:02
In Three
Speaker 8
1:29:04
that's a Priyesh, yeah, yes, sir, right. How are you? I'm good. Thank you.
Speaker 8
1:29:13
San Mateo, yes, sir, going to work there, going back home. I was here. A lot of people go there for something, convention area. You know,
1:29:24
there's a big convention hall. Yeah,
Speaker 8
1:29:30
it's nice weather there too. It's better than here, bit more warm. Yeah.
1:29:37
So you work around here. I work
Speaker 7
1:29:40
in Santa Clara, oh, my God, I come here to meet startups.
Speaker 8
1:29:44
Oh, startup, yes, that's good, man. Now you go home, yes, where you guys are with Santa Clara,
Speaker 7
1:29:51
Qualcomm, where Qualcomm, so it's like, I work at Qualcomm, and where, exactly, like it's closer to the freeway. I don't know the exact name.
