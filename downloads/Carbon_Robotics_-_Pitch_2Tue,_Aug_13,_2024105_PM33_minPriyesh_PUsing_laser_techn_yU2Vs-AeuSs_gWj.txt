0:00The activity on the field was happening for money. There's $1 value associated with every every action. So it's a great place to deploy to deploy robotics. What people get tripped up on is they try to do silly things, like robots as a service, or they try to do something that just doesn't work with the model. In egg tech, you know, there's a lot of people who took existing tools like spray rigs and put cameras on them and tried to make it a targeted spray, which, you know, has like, a limited amount of benefit. And I think part of the issue is nobody was really coming at this problem from first principles, right? If you say, Well, what is the best way to solve this issue, ignoring everything that people have tried with the tools they had at their disposal from the past, doing something brand new. So that's how we got here. You know, they the laser weeder is an incredible device. It allows people to grow food without spraying chemicals all over the place, without having to hire migrant laborers to come through and pull weeds out in the hot sun. It removes a lot of the human suffering in the world, because pulling weeds is a terrible job, and we have migrant laborers die every year in this country because they're out in the hot sun pulling these weeds out, the food that you eat and consume in most grocery stores and most restaurants is suffering from 60 years of chemical application and evolution to deal with that, right? The food you eat has evolved to survive chemicals. It's not evolved to have nutrient content. And if you take a urine sample of most adults in the United States today, will discover that everybody has glyphosate in their system. Glyphosate is the active ingredient. Roundup. Not good for you. It's carcinogenic that we're banning more and more chemicals every day. Dactyl just got banned this previous week. A lot of our growers had previously been using Dactyl, and now that they have laser weeder, they know that they're safe from worrying about this kind of stuff. Paraquat is causing cancer. Sorry. Paraquat is causing Parkinson's, rather, in a huge portion of the farmer population in the United States, all of this garbage is happening because we didn't have good tools, and we only had the chemical outflow from the experiments we'd run in the in the 50s and 60s that had produced and produced things like Agent Orange, and so we haven't been able to take a fresh look at this problem in 60 years. Laser reader, you know, is, I think, the first demonstration of a whole new wave of machines that are going to be able to do things in new ways. So, you know, we're proud and happy of having taken a leadership position in ag Tech, I think that that's probably true. You know, our revenue is more than all of these startups, or we have more customers than all of these startups, right? But I think a lot of that is because we build really good machines when we take a fresh look at the problem. So that's where we are. We're now embarking on a program to generate, to build up and sell g2, of the laser leader that the laser leader that everybody loves and has experienced. And then we have our our autonomous tractor stuff coming out next year that we're in beta with right now. Well, it'll be launched this year, but pushing in big revenue through next year. And then we're just going to continue this cycle of evaluating opportunity, looking at where our AI robotics can add value, maybe in agriculture, maybe not in agriculture, right? We're not really tied to agriculture. We're tied to the opportunity. Okay, so that's the basis of our company, and we're going to continue to build cool stuff. Man, that's it. Nice ball. Yeah?

S Speaker 24:01Maybe kind of go with with some of that, and not to be too philosophical, but maybe, you know, can you maybe give us a sense of what's changed over the past couple of years? You know, I think in ag, it's often viewed as a slow technology adoption segment. It's partially not true. I think they're extremely progressive. They tend to test and do a lot of stuff, but they also tend to get stuck in innovation cycles, like they'll experiment with a lot of different types of solutions, so we'll see kind of broad early based adoption, but a lack of scaling. And I think that's true for, you know, kind of many of the people we've, you know, met and followed over the many years, right where, you know, you kind of get into one or two farms, you get 50 robots, you know, whatever, 20 robots. Or you sprinkle them around a couple of different places, but then the broad scale adoption isn't there. I'm not sure it's really a technology problem for part of it. You know, the value proposition is very clear, especially around labor shortages and a lot of things you've mentioned. You know, has anything really changed on that side that's kind of changed because, I guess the the ultimate question is, you know, what's really required for through automation and act right for it to be scaled up. Because I think the experimenting and the innovation phase is kind of an ongoing what needs to change, whether it's workflow, mindset, whatever it is, in order to kind of get to broader scale.

S Speaker 15:41Well, I mean, we had our contracts for our first $8 million in revenue before we had ever built a machine.
Well, I mean, we had our contracts for our first $8 million in revenue before we had ever built a machine.
Well, I mean, we had our contracts for our first $8 million in revenue before we had ever built a machine.
Well, I mean, we had our contracts for our first $8 million in revenue before we had ever built a machine.
S Speaker 15:54I don't know if anything needs to, needed to change so much as we just took a fresh look at the problem. It didn't, didn't try to show up in this weird way that didn't fit with what the farmers wanted. I mean, you mentioned some of these companies, right? Farm wise is a perfect example of a company who took an existing tool, added cameras to it, and then tried to charge an hourly robot as a service fee, and it just doesn't work. It fell apart. So part of it is the business, business model. Those guys since then have changed around. They've switched CEOs. They've removed the autonomy from their product. They converted to a pull behind and they're switching to a for sale model. So I think some of this is, I mean, honestly, some of the problem is, business school MBA types joined up on the farm and trying to redo the way that the business model works. And this is not what you should do. It doesn't work that way, you know. So we showed up and picked machines, and we're selling them really fast, you know, if somebody else had done that, it probably would have done fine. They think you got to meet people where they are, and they don't want to hear about your you know, robot as a service. It just doesn't work that way. So if you look at all the companies that have been trying to do this, they've either pivoted away from that model, or they or they failed. And we never had that model because we listened to the farmers from the beginning, you got to listen to your customers. So I'm not, I'm not pointing at any particular change in farming or agriculture. I think that these folks were always ready to be accepting of innovation. It was more about Silicon Valley business models not matching what was going on in the rest of the farm. And look, I mean, I'm guilty of this too, right? My background was all Silicon Valley tech stuff. I mean, Seattle and Silicon Valley, you know, whatever, that whole thing, but at least I had the foresight to not bring that with me when I was trying to enter this market. I think too many people have gone down the road of just deciding we're going to use the old school Silicon Valley playbook on the farms, and it doesn't work. That's at least my assessment. And then

S Speaker 28:03I think, if I recall correctly, on the product suite, you started with a full size standalone weeder, right? Tractor with weeder, and you're, are you moving toward a full system as well?

S Speaker 18:17We have only ever sold the pull system. Only ever sold. Courses we have. That's the only thing we ever sold. We've sold. And so we just put product number 100 on the line. We'll shift unit number 100 in four weeks, or something like that, you know. And at a million, million and a half dollars a piece, right? Like we're doing, we're doing that's a good business for us. We built the autonomous unit, originally as a demo unit, as an example of what we could do, and we use them to get in the field, validate, lays, weeding and refine our product suite. And in the process of doing that, that's where we came to the eventual product line, which is three times as wide as those original units, and it is pulled by a tractor, pulled by a tractor for a number of practical reasons, pulled by

And in the process of doing that, that's where we came to the eventual product line, which is three times as wide as those original units, and it is pulled by a tractor, pulled by a tractor for a number of practical reasons, pulled by
We have only ever sold the pull system. Only ever sold. Courses we have. That's the only thing we ever sold. We've sold. And so we just put product number 100 on the line.

S Speaker 110:05We do get, on average, $85,000 per year per unit in services, support fees. So there's a little bit of recurring there, but a lot of this is the same way we get predictability in the same way that Tesla or Apple or Nvidia does, right? We look at our product momentum and figure out which regions are doing what and in what time frames, and then we build towards that. And a lot of this is following the curve from the last the last couple of years. So I we have pretty good predictability about how every quarter is going to do, because we can map it on to previous years and then relative to previous quarters, and we get pretty good data out of

S Speaker 110:57We do. We have over 100 different crops in our deep learning database. Currently we have, I think the last number was 25 million labels of weeds in our data set. We have. The way it works is our neural net, our deep our deep learning AI system is crop specific, so every one of those crops has a specific AI that knows how to deal with everything else around it. We focus mostly on vegetable crops, and then we are expanding into corn, soy and some cotton next year, that expansion is enabled by building much bigger machines. So in the vegetable area, a 20 foot machine is what's expected, which takes three rows, three standard planting rows. In the bigger corn they want. They want a 60 foot machine, which is three times the size of that. So we're pushing 60 foot machines out next year and moving into some different props through that. But we currently, we do everything from onions to carrots to tulips to catnip. We got all kinds of stuff, and it's very easy for us to bring up a new rod. So it takes us 24 to 48 hours from seeing a crop for the first time to being able to weed it. Effectively, we have a process, taking pictures, uploading images, get them labeled, to train the model to play

And we've demonstrated this repeatedly the there is a point at which they are too big to effectively be killed with the lasers. And so we want to get in early. Earlier is better for us, for efficacy, for speed, for the amount, just everything, from the amount of power it takes to weed to field, all that stuff gets easier the earlier you go in, because it's literally, it's a geometric problem, right? The weed grows in two or sometimes three dimensions. And so the quicker you get in, the less energy it takes to kill the thing. In the right time. In the right time, it takes about 20 joules of energy to nuke one of these weeds. And that's kind of the sweet spot. That's where we want to be.

So like, in like, a lot of these vegetable crops, it's pointed very densely, and so they're just run the laser. We are no problem. Some of these crops where it's more sparse, wider gaps between the plant lines, they'll put laser weeder and have it just focus on the lasers on the crop line, and then they'll run a cultivator back through to take the weeds out of the middle. That's it. That's an effective technique that we've sort of CO come up with with the farmers. You know, they they kind of showed us how they wanted and that's fine, too. So we'll do, we'll do, they use the they use the tools that they have. So they don't, they consider us a tool, and everything that they have is a tool, and they figure out how to deploy those tools at where.

S Speaker 114:53No, it's, well, it's just pulling the weeder and just weeding. That's its whole job. If it, if it, if that tractor could run 24/7, during farming season, they would, they would do it just, just pulling the weeder, because that, that that did, that dictates how many acres they get over, which dictates how much produce they they put up. So they it's totally worth it for them to just, just drive laser, keep that tractor running. We have people who didn't turn their machine off for four months last year, they hot fueled the whole thing. They switched drivers live. They just kept running and kept running. Kept running. They got a beautiful harvest out of it. They got this huge uplift in their amount of crops that they got out of those fields, so much so that they're changing their farming practices to have an extra cycle of selling produce that they didn't have before.

S Speaker 215:51kind of restrictions on when you can use the weeding system? Or would this be comparable to human labor? I guess, kind of thinking, things like super bright light. Obviously, that's a lot of time on a farm, but computer vision systems typically do worse in very bright light.

S Speaker 116:07Yeah. I mean, not for not for us. So kind of what I was describing before about re approaching problems from first principles, we knew right away that that was going to be an issue on the farm fields. So you may see, you may have seen robots that try to drop like a skirt down or something, to block the light, we realized that that was just kind of silly and never going to work well, because you're always going to have situations where the sun is low on the horizon and it could get under any any amount of blockage. So what we did was we just said, Okay, we're going to overpower the sun. And so we've developed a lighting system that we filed the patents on, where it charges up these big capacitors, and then the capacitors are charging for nine milliseconds out of every 10, and then the last millisecond, it dumps all that energy out these lights that overpowers the sun. It's five times the brightness of the sun. But when you're looking at it, you can't really tell, because it's only going on a 10% duty cycle. But what that means is our cameras get these beautiful pictures, and you can't tell if it's nighttime or daytime, or if the sun is low in the reservoir, whatever, because we just took the problem away. But it's an example of this same kind of engineering where we came at it from first principles and realized what we're going to really need to do is just beat the sun in its own game, which is making the making the ground look bright. And so for us, we just solved that problem in a in a much different way that solved it forever for us. And it's one like I mentioned. It's one of the times that we have

S Speaker 117:47every time you stick a blade in the ground, a couple things happen. One thing happens is that blade, as you're pulling through the dirt, it creates a dirt blade. It's, it's almost like a fluid, but it's, it's grains, and that will get out and land on your plants. So what you need to do is drive either slow enough that that dirt wave doesn't get out on your plants, and that means and you need to keep the blade away from your crops, right? So it limits your weed proximity that you can get to, because this blade is going to come through and it's going to make this giant heap of dirt. So you've got that problem, right? It limits what weeds you can get. You can't get too close to the crops. The other thing is that when you're pulling blades to the ground in something that's a leafy green, or what you're selling into the produce market at the end of the day is the leaves on top. The blade going through will spin up all this micro bacteria that's in the in the ground that's meant to affix nutrients and nitrogen. If that stuff lands on the leaves of your produce, it will damage the produce. And there's lots of examples of this happening. So it damages the produce. There are also viruses in the dirt. There's a very nasty lettuce virus that comes through every season. If you are spinning that soil up like this, you will you risk having this outbreak of your there's a couple of different lettuce viruses, and all of this comes from the fact that you're pulling this topsoil up. The other thing that happens is we have in this in this country, we have 50 years left of good topsoil, and it's because of over tillage and over cultivation. Every time you pull something, you've probably seen this before, if you've ever driven through any of these farm countries, the giant, giant cloud of topsoil blowing across the road. It's because they were running blades through the ground, and that topsoil is what has all the nutrients. And once that's gone, it's gone. So if you're a farmer, you're a multi generational farmer, and you have this land, the last thing you want to do is keep ripping that top soil away, because it will destroy your soil fertility. There's lots of negatives to just dragging lakes through ground like this. There's some amount of it that they have to do, because you need to make the ground fluffy and soft every year to be able to replant. But running blades for doing things like killing weeds is a huge waste of that resource. Damages the crops. It's limited in its effective. Effectiveness. There's a lot of lot of lot of negatives to use in blades.

S Speaker 126:57Dear is 100 year old company that has done two acquisitions recently, I mean, somewhat recently, Blue River and the Bear Flag, clearly trying to do things in this more. Call it advanced computer, World of robots. Most of the people from both of those groups have left at this point from deer. I mean, for obvious reasons, probably I don't know how, as 100 year old organization, you innovate without having a culture of being able to do that internally. And I think they're struggling right now. You've seen the massive amount of layoffs they've done this year. So I don't really know where deer is going to go long term on the innovation front, it's not really a thing that we see. We don't see like deer equipment, other than tractors out there. So I think that, you know, deer is kind of the big incumbent. I mean, I wish them well, they make nice tractors. It's a good, you know, it's a good Corporation, a good organization, but I think they're struggling to figure out their their ability to innovate, and I hope, over time, you know, they get it figured out, because even on the tractor side, they're starting to fall behind in the execution on the innovation. There's a tractor company out of Germany called fence that is building really nice tractors that maybe you've heard of that are act just like a deer, but they have a lot better software on them, and I think that's where deer is fight is going to be, is, how do they not lose lead on the tractor side? And it's coming, you know, it's coming for them, so they're going to have to figure this out.

S Speaker 128:56that okay. So we're launching a retrofit kit that plugs into existing tractors that makes them autonomous. We're testing it right now. We're going to be demoing it later this year, and we're going to be in full sales mode on that product next year. Okay, so I'll just give you my spiel on this, the reason why tractor autonomy has been suffering so badly is because all of the exception cases that show up, right? So I've talked to a lot of farmers about this stuff. They've tried the John Deere autonomy stack. They've tried all these autonomy stacks, and the overwhelming response is that they can't trust it, because it stops within the first hour of use, because it sees something that it doesn't like, it gets confused, doesn't know what to do. Is, is a problem, right? You're going to put your tractor in the field. You want it to run for eight hours. You come back after two hours and it stopped. You know, half hour in this job, it's terrible. So what we we have a better autonomy stack, but the other thing that we did is we have the ability to remotely take over and control any of these tractors from our own remote operators. So the exception cases alert somebody who can take over, deal with it immediately as a farmer. That means that we can solve all of your tractor use case right now, while we continue to build and enhance the autonomy. The beautiful thing about that method is that while we're building and enhancing the autonomy, we're also getting the training data, because we can see what the human operator did, right? Because we're doing the whole thing remotely. So that's our strategy on this. We're taking that same autonomy stack that you may have seen in the old robots that were applying it to this tractor site. What's unique about it, and we have patent problems as well. What's unique about it is we have the only software that can navigate the field entirely visually. Everything else does stuff where it has to move from GPS work to GPS work, and that means, as a farmer, as a grower, you have to lay out on your whole field and mark all the GPS locations, which is somewhat common, but certainly not universal. And so for our autonomy, it's all visual. You just throw the thing in there and it goes, it figures out in a drive up and down the furrows, it can detect the whole layout of the field. So it's a unique stack combined with, I think, a unique solution to the exception cases, and I think it's going to be pretty gangbusters as soon as we get get that announced and launched. So we're in beta test right now on farm
that okay. So we're launching a retrofit kit that plugs into existing tractors that makes them autonomous. We're testing it right now. We're going to be demoing it later this year, and we're going to be in full sales mode on that product next year.

They've tried all these autonomy stacks, and the overwhelming response is that they can't trust it, because it stops within the first hour of use, because it sees something that it doesn't like, it gets confused, doesn't know what to do. Is, is a problem, right? You're going to put your tractor in the field. You want it to run for eight hours. You come back after two hours and it stopped. You know, half hour in this job, it's terrible. So what we we have a better autonomy stack, but the other thing that we did is we have the ability to remotely take over and control any of these tractors from our own remote operators. So the exception cases alert somebody who can take over, deal with it immediately as a farmer. That means that we can solve all of your tractor use case right now, while we continue to build and enhance the autonomy. The beautiful thing about that method is that while we're building and enhancing the autonomy, we're also getting the training data, because we can see what the human operator did, right? Because we're doing the whole thing remotely. So that's our strategy on this. We're taking that same autonomy stack that you may have seen in the old robots that were applying it to this tractor site. What's unique about it, and we have patent problems as well. What's unique about it is we have the only software that can navigate the field entirely visually. Everything else does stuff where it has to move from GPS work to GPS work, and that means, as a farmer, as a grower, you have to lay out on your whole field and mark all the GPS locations, which is somewhat common, but certainly not universal. And so for our autonomy, it's all visual. You just throw the thing in there and it goes, it figures out in a drive up and down the furrows, it can detect the whole layout of the field. So it's a unique stack combined with, I think, a unique solution to the exception cases, and I think it's going to be pretty gangbusters as soon as we get get that announced and launched. So we're in beta test right now on farm
that okay. So we're launching a retrofit kit that plugs into existing tractors that makes them autonomous. We're testing it right now. We're going to be demoing it later this year, and we're going to be in full sales mode on that product next year.
