S Speaker 56:54And what we like to do here is like, think about a role more than a task. I think a lot of marketing is confused on this, but like this should be a maybe thing that you can teach a bunch of tasks to rather than investing in a single task as a one off. So do you have an idea of an agent that you want to build?
And what we like to do here is like, think about a role more than a task.

So do you have an idea of an agent that you want to build?
S Speaker 27:08Something I've tried with other platforms is just an agent which can analyze decks, give me the right metrics out of that, run OCR on the deck, things like that. So can I? Can I sort of use that idea?

S Speaker 58:57it's really kind of thinking about thinking about it as if you hire an intern and they go through the HR onboarding for the company of like, this is what the company does. This is what markets we play in. It's kind of adjusting those pieces of background information.

S Speaker 59:22Yeah, we certainly can do that. And like, there's ways that we work with companies where we'll kind of inject certain understandings for all agents that are working at the company. So yeah, there's a lot of layers underneath this that we can kind of plug in, depending on how opinionated some of the organizations want. Some of them don't want that, though, because they're going to build agents that are maybe in different brands or different contexts, and they don't want to, like, pollute that. So it really

S Speaker 59:53ways, this is almost like you're working with a recruiter who's like, Okay, you're hiring someone. What is the profile of the type of person that you're trying to hire? And these are things where, I'll warn you, like, it will talk to you forever if you're care, if you're not careful, like, you can just say all the above, or Yes. Like, you don't have to necessarily, like, give it all pieces. It wants to be as exhaustive as you do. So it kind of plays off of your tone, right?

11:06caught. There we go.
S Speaker 511:11Um, okay, so we, we got something a little bit cross wired here, I think because it hit that error hit right at that moment it was trying to create. It lost it. We're going to we'll shortcut it a little bit. If you take that identity, what should have happened is that agent should have automatically been created and fit in your life. Left side panel. Once you're at this point, it's really hard to teach an agent to be like, go back and try that thing again, that it thinks worked. So the what the best way is if you take that identity and context from that top section and just copy that cool and then on the left, actually hit that little plus icon right above that, the agent plus went up. Oh yeah. So we'll just do it through the form, just to get you to the other so you can paste that exactly in there. Instructions. Yep, exactly. Give it a description and

S Speaker 512:17And you can always change pictures, but yeah, exactly. Go to Create, and there's your agent, right? And it's funny, like, one of the few best we can love this week, if you're like, take a breath when that happens. Like, I just spent three weeks trying to build an agent with blank chain, like, and you just, like, breezed past the back of that agent just got created. And so it's just really fun to kind of iterate through that with people. So if you look at deckscape, now, if you hit there's a little information I find that will be there if you hover, or, I guess, Dex scope, I'm sorry, at the top on the left, yep. To the right, there's an information I thought, yeah, cool. So this is the kind of that edit panel for for your agent. This is where the model, context, protocol servers come in, right? So there's some of the more popular ones up top, but you can search. There's 2000 of them behind the scenes that are
And you can always change pictures, but yeah, exactly. Go to Create, and there's your agent, right?

available. Yeah. And Ryan, again, in enterprise context, if we use a certain set of internal tools, how do I get my own API, own authentication identity set up here?

available. Yeah. And Ryan, again, in enterprise context, if we use a certain set of internal tools, how do I get my own API, own authentication identity set up here?
S Speaker 513:16Yeah. So this is all OAuth based, but what we generally work with the teams is we're onboarding and kind of your context is saying, Okay, what tools do you are you comfortable with agents in your company having access to it's all going to be a lot. So it's still good. It's not gonna exceed your permissions, right? So if they added Salesforce, but you don't have access to Salesforce, it's gonna fail still, but they still want to narrow it down data exfiltration concerns and other pieces like that, right? They don't want you taking data out of Salesforce and pushing it to your personal Google Drive. So exactly to your point, like, when we do that kind of broader onboarding, we go through and filter this down to set connections, what the platform team normally sets those up, and then for other people to onboard, it's like, oh, they're already available. And so then you can just add them to your agent and the enterprise approved ones understood.
Yeah.

They don't want you taking data out of Salesforce and pushing it to your personal Google Drive. So exactly to your point, like, when we do that kind of broader onboarding, we go through and filter this down to set connections, what the platform team normally sets those up, and then for other people to onboard, it's like, oh, they're already available. And so then you can just add them to your agent and the enterprise approved ones understood.
Yeah. So this is all OAuth based, but what we generally work with the teams is we're onboarding and kind of your context is saying, Okay, what tools do you are you comfortable with agents in your company having access to it's all going to be a lot. So it's still good. It's not gonna exceed your permissions, right? So if they added Salesforce, but you don't have access to Salesforce, it's gonna fail still, but they still want to narrow it down data exfiltration concerns and other pieces like that, right?

But it's still gonna be, could be, we'll call it a an elementary grade thing, or a middle school grade thing. Yeah, the way that I think, that we, we think you work with agents, is you teach them, you review this, and you point out, and you're like, Well, what about this? Or what about that?

S Speaker 516:54the real fun of it at the end comes when you hit that free Task button that's in the bottom right, once you taught it how to do that, and you make it a repetitive thing.

S Speaker 517:18task to so when you're done, right? So like, imagine like, you're going to work through this whole thing, you're going to get to the like, this is exactly how I want to look at company analysis. I've given it feedback on formatting and what to include and what for the research to do. Then you hit, create tasks, and a separate model is going to take all the context and turn that into a repeatable set of instructions. Again, our belief is humans shouldn't be writing prompts. They leave a lot of important pieces out, so that's when they can synthesize and then it becomes available to do on a repetitive basis. Interesting. This one takes a pretty advanced model that's kind of running behind the scenes, chewing through all this context, because you don't because you don't run this very often. And so our plan, just like give it a really powerful thing, it's okay if it takes a little bit longer, because you want to work every time.

S Speaker 218:07And one of the things Ryan that, that I saw in the deck being pointed out is how deterministic this entire system can be because of the modus runtime. Can you expand a little bit more on that?

And one of the things Ryan that, that I saw in the deck being pointed out is how deterministic this entire system can be because of the modus runtime. Can you expand a little bit more on that?
S Speaker 518:19Yeah, I mean, so as you work with this, it's going to start remembering things, right? It's going to learn pieces. So that's both through the runtime. There's a lot of work that's happening on every one of these conversations to synthesize context, understand new information and like things to remember. And then it's also synthesized down into the graph layer as kind of with the D graph power. And so you have lots of layers of synthesis happening. So over time, it's just naturally going to get better. And so that increases the accuracy of it like, because you have those points of control as well. I think about like the cruise liner that we were working with, where they were really struggling, because every time they asked their agent for like hotels in France, you would get like responses that included things like a hotel that was in Germany, but the description mentioned like, just 50 miles from France. And so like agents get confused about that fuzziness of it. And so because we're able to kind of work with them to like, have that, some of that determinism at the lower levels of knowledge, and say, like no, use this as a reference point. Do a query as part of the agent in response to pull the subset of hotels in France on a deterministic basis, and then search within those you start to get increasing levels of accuracy. And so yeah, the goal really is like, start really easy. Over time, the system will get naturally better. But then with the large companies, like, Okay, that's cool. But like, if I get from 95 to 96% accuracy, that's worth a lot of money to me, because at this scale we're at, then we have levers to work with them on
Yeah, I mean, so as you work with this, it's going to start remembering things, right? It's going to learn pieces. So that's both through the runtime.

S Speaker 219:44improving that. And ran just just to sort of ensure that I'm getting this clearly is, is the determinism part just coming from context splicing, giving it the right context at the right time, and creating different levels of, I would say, for the agent, or is it also on the retry level, reinforcement learning level, things like that.

I
S Speaker 520:10think about that is one of the same, in some ways, like, I think like context engineering is like, kind of the successor of prompt engineering that would make sure at the right data at the right time. I think there's an element of reinforcement to that, like, whatever behaviors been and like what that's gathering. So, like, yes, like modus at that level is automatically storing every inference, historically your behaviors around that inference, whether we're saved as a task or not. Like, those are, like you could argue, like you could call those reinforcement learning. We kind of think about it as, like, making sure the right context is available

S Speaker 521:02you click, click, create task again. If it worked, it should be there already. I don't know what's going on. To investigate that. Get back to you, but

S Speaker 521:16this. I These things are going to kind of naturally come together in a really interesting way of like, oh, sorry if you if we believe that you wanted a tool run and the model didn't choose to run a tool, we're going to push the model to run a tool, right?

you'll see that task will pop up right there that you get.
S Speaker 522:48One of the things we're working on, and I it seems like we may have gotten caught here, is like, sometimes the agent will think that like, Oh, I just want to run an analysis on hyper mode every time it's like, no, no. That's intentional.

S Speaker 123:25let's say maybe I can, I can flash like, what the end state might look like for you, absolutely where. So this is the theory version. This like Tom clan gives his method where, basically I the agent, especially if it's my research channels, like, Hey, can we start Qualcomm? And basically it runs through, and I can take a system prompt that we fit, we use, or basically it's like, Hey, your theory bot, you go to workflow, and basically this is, like, these are pieces that he runs through. And then we got specific about what the actual structure that we wanted to over time, like this, like, took iterations of me, like, shouting at the agent. And now, when I go to haters like the quick, like, you have five sentence pitch, you're the founder, she's a current leadership you're previous CEOs. Here's fundraising your best capital position through different departments. But in a way, just actually Have him send me an email of kg plus agent, very often. I'll also go to what the theory team does. They have an internal listserv that they think is to Okay.

And then we got specific about what the actual structure that we wanted to over time, like this, like, took iterations of me, like, shouting at the agent. And now, when I go to haters like the quick, like, you have five sentence pitch, you're the founder, she's a current leadership you're previous CEOs. Here's fundraising your best capital position through different departments. But in a way, just actually Have him send me an email of kg plus agent, very often. I'll also go to what the theory team does. They have an internal listserv that they think is to Okay.
let's say maybe I can, I can flash like, what the end state might look like for you, absolutely where. So this is the theory version.

They're constructing a big Knowledge Graph awaiting prime July this week is the planet, and then they're building a large number of agents on top of it. We expected to actually be a mixture of code first agents for their link shop. So they really couple blank chain agents on top of hyper mode, on public and Ultra, and they start listening to code agents, which is more like the runs and workflows. Like, hey, I'm a network agent. I know this will be debugging for x, y, z. I'm going to teach this thing how to run through that debug and then

What we'd like to do is actually, like, where the actual runtime that's going to be essentially executing the agent logic. We're trying to open that up to say, Okay, right now we can do essentially, like, TypeScript and go language support. When we support Python, the plan is then support all of these other agent frameworks where they're the SDK, and then we're the engine of, like, okay, like, the extra execution, the connection pooling, the scaling, all of that like, or backup backend orchestration we're going to support. We don't do that today. I'm group we talked about, hey, but open can quick succession. The goal is like, we want folks to check in all of their events.

S Speaker 127:18I don't think so. I think one of the things, like, the big lesson learned for me ever so was like, Do you want to be right, or do you want to win? I think a lot of organizations, for a bunch of reasons, are going to have different stacks and different tool chains. I fundamentally believe 90% of agent structure is going to happen in natural language in three years. We're going to own that that that front door, if some organizations pay for a bunch of reasons. We needed to do this where we still write a bunch of Python code, whatever, whatever. Great no worries, like checking in the same way, like HR platform, sometimes you have first party employees. That's good contractors. We still registered contractors. They still need their employee handbooks. They still need to know what jobs to do something to make sure we're having their performance. Don't take that same approach. Check in if it's written in Python. That's just your third party contractor. Great man who cares, because our goal is like, I want to, I want to own software
