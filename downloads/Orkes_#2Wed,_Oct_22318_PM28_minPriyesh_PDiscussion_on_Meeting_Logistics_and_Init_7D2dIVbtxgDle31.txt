S Speaker 10:05I was there, and I think we both are together. So I thought we'll just do the teams link. How are you doing? Doing being good, you know, just busy in the beads and trying to figure out there's multiple, multiple balls in the air so, but yeah, you know, thanks for sharing the data room. Lot of details there. You know, we've been trying to spend some time and see you know how the space is evolving. But before we begin, any any update on your end. I know you were expecting Tom sheets or planning to get one.

S Speaker 20:40Yeah, yeah. We went there, and we chose one of the, you know, partners that we like the most, and we are in the process of closing that out right. But yeah, like, also, like to hear from your side, you know what? You've been doing some research in the space and us, with all of that, and then we can also talk a little bit after that on ground dynamics and
Yeah, yeah. We went there, and we chose one of the, you know, partners that we like the most, and we are in the process of closing that out right.

S Speaker 11:07stuff. Yeah, 100% I think, you know, for us, the biggest one is, you know, understanding, how do we win against temporal? And I know there's a lot of material in the, you know, in the deck that you have, and at a high level, we do understand that, you know, being code based has its own challenges. And, you know, being more of a visual flow workflow engine, you know, and being more flexible, and having on prem deployment, and all those good things are there, but just trying to understand, like, how, how that dynamic is evolving, and you mentioned that you've won customers from temporal so that will be also good to validate. And the second case is, you know, just trying to understand a lot of these workflows for agents and AI applications are going to look very different from the workflows that we've been building. So how, how are customers using orcas to orchestrate let's, let's maybe unpack an agent and understand that a little better. And I think one of my, one of the questions my colleague had was, how much revenue today do you have from these AI or agent workflows, right versus traditional workflows? Because I think if we come in at this point, we'll be making a bet that you can grow from your and a lot of it will be driven by newer workflows that will be built. And why is org is better than temporal, and I'm guessing you guys are the like. These are the two key players, but yeah, camunda is also comes up sometimes, but yeah, those are the key questions we have. George, what we are thinking is maybe we can unpack the use case for agents. Understand that better. Second, understand the differentiation from temporal better. Third was, of course, you know, dissecting some of the metrics that you have, but, but, yeah, that's what we had for today. How you want to proceed?
stuff. Yeah, 100% I think, you know, for us, the biggest one is, you know, understanding, how do we win against temporal?

S Speaker 22:54Yeah, yeah. I can take all those questions one by one, right? Like, so I think the first question was around temporal. So the way temporal have positioned themselves as their workflow, as code, but I think, like when you and this is where we actually live with a lot of customers as well at temporal, but when you look at temporal, you know, what is the orchestration? There you are trying to orchestrate services, pieces of code, microservices, actually the endpoints, right? That already exists in a company, or people are building in a company, right? Yeah, these pieces of code are written by developers in the company. That doesn't change, whether it's temporal, whether it's orcas, any orchestrations, and that doesn't change, right? So that is still written in code. Blockchain is there. Then comes the orchestration there, yeah. Like, how do you call between these services? What's the what's the dynamic and stuff like that? Yeah. So there, there are. Temporal has chosen the workflow as code as the only approach, yeah. And they just do only that. What we have done is, we'll say that is the entry point for everyone. We have three different ways of doing that. One is to code so you can do workflow score throughout SDKs. Then there is the UI piece. You can go and do everything in the UI. And then there is the you can store these things as workflows configuration, right? Like, sometimes the DevOps player, you know, people need to kind of configure this, you know, save that house of JSON format and do it right? So what we say is like, hey, that's an entry point. Keep it compatible with each other. You can start with UI, motor configuration and vice versa. So do it that way. So that way entry point is like an opened up to a lot more users. Where we excel really is, you know, this is basically just creating a workflow site, but then how do you execute them at scale with high reliability? That's really where we've been over, right? So I think there is a misnomer that they have put right at their workflow score. I think, you know, that's just one way to do it. We just, we basically do it in three ways, right? That's basically,
Yeah, yeah. I can take all those questions one by one, right? Like, so I think the first question was around temporal.

S Speaker 14:54you give flexibility to developers. What I'm trying to understand is, what are the pros and cons of each of these approaches, flexibility, I understand. But, you know, temporal is, of course, successful in its own way. Something, Something is definitely working there. So just curious to understand what are the pros and cons of, you know, UI based approach, configuration based approach, or even a code based approach, yeah, yeah.

S Speaker 25:20So we also just about introduced one more, which is the prom based approach. That's just we are just about roll that out. And I think the mode of how people think about building stuff developers that has changed over the last one year, like, if you look at cursors, lovable strategy that's able then put your idea out. That prompt will basically create most of it for you. So we are doing a prompt based work location that's going to come out very soon. But again, how do we just not think about this one? But, you know, take things like two steps ahead, right? But coming back to your question, when developers think about writing code, one of the comfort factors is it's in the IDE. I don't have to step out anywhere to write code so it can, it can come right there, right? We basically, we approach us to basically look at like a all the personas can come in. Yeah, it is, again, dependent on the persona of the So, for example, I can tell you this thing that so Twilio, when we first launched this, we did not have the workforce for when we first started one of our very early customers, they asked for this. We had just read the Java version of the workflow s code. The Golang version hadn't come out yet. We did that six months later, we basically went and asked, Hey, what do you use the most overflow creation, right? Like there's three different approaches. Unanimously, is the gay 99% of the people just do the UI. Why? Because they just want to write code in things that matters the most. So, yes, you said, like the phone has gotten, you know more in the Bay Area, I think, like they had, like, a couple of years Head Start ahead of us. Okay, right? Okay, open source came right around the same time, but we have actually caught up that kind of really, really fast out there, right? Okay, both from a revenue trajectory perspective, we know where they were at this point and how fast we're going as well, right? So, but I think, like, thinking was like, Hey, we are all here today. Like, how do we go and do the next step, which is, you know, doing prom based stuff, right? That's what we are focused on, rather than, like, you know, you know, semantics of creating, creating the workflow.
So we also just about introduced one more, which is the prom based approach. That's just we are just about roll that out.

S Speaker 17:25Got it, got it. And I agree to your point about the convenience of being in the IDE and, you know, single place you build that, are there any trade offs? Is that? Is it easier to build workflows? Is it so I read about, you know, how in air gapped situations, or, you know, if systems go down, your code will still your code will still be executed, and your workflows will at least get to completion. So it's highly resilient, unless, unless I'm mistaken there, but yeah,
Got it, got it. And I agree to your point about the convenience of being in the IDE and, you know, single place you build that, are there any trade offs? Is that? Is it easier to build workflows?

S Speaker 27:53no, actually, it is the other way around. And this is where we have displaced temporality like Q bank is happening right now. It is, it is actually harder to do that when you're doing that in code. And the misnomer that people or the misconception was there like, because it's between code, you can do it pretty much anything. But if you look at temporals documentation on how we can do this, the only thing you can do that in a workflow, worker is called other activities, like which we call tasks, right? They do not recommend putting anything else, because if you put that anything else that is basically not durable, right? So their recommendation is you call, you call an activity, followed by any operator that you want to do another activity. Don't write pieces of code that is not an activity. So there's a huge restriction there that people don't understand. If you go and write anything go and write anything. So between an activity call and the next activity call, if there's a bunch of bunch of code, and during that time, if that, if that particular worker falls down, yeah, that is not doable. So there is a huge amount of restriction on what you can write in that Okay, now, which basically means that the approach that we have taken, saying that, hey, we have decoupled workflow, the definition and where it is actually running from the services it's trying to orchestrate. Yeah, that basically makes it even more resilient, right? Like, that's really where the winning factor comes in when we operate at scale. There is one more downside to that, so the good as a developer writing code, it's right there. You can just do it. It's in the ID. There's a convenience of that, yeah? The big downside there is, let's say you chose Java as the language of writing code, yeah? Like workforce, work, right? There's a bunch of restrictions that come in. Like, now you're basically saying that, yes, I can still kind of call worker task, activity, workers, that might be written in another language, but you can't send signals, you can't send triggers, you can't send all some workflows, any of those things. You're just tied to that one language, right? And here's where companies are kind of against that. Let's say like, let's say Master is an upcoming language, if the choice of a workflow orchestration engine is going to restrict you from choosing us. That is what people don't want, right? So you want to make it a language agnostic, you know, like, let's say if you choose a database, it's okay if your choice of a database is going to restrict you from what are the technologies and they're going to bring in, like, you want to choose that, right? Like, so, same, same thing with the workflow orchestration, that's the downside piece of it,
no, actually, it is the other way around. And this is where we have displaced temporality like Q bank is happening right now. It is, it is actually harder to do that when you're doing that in code.

S Speaker 110:22and you mentioned Coupang is one contract you won bunch of other
and you mentioned Coupang is one contract you won bunch of other
and you mentioned Coupang is one contract you won bunch of other
and you mentioned Coupang is one contract you won bunch of other
S Speaker 110:39Got it. And how are you pricing today, Joe, and what is the I saw the growth story on multiple enterprises. How are they like? What is the expansion? Is it more and more workflows being added in a more depth to the workflows, more features? Yeah. Can you walk us through maybe couple of examples of land and expand?
Got it. And how are you pricing today, Joe, and what is the I saw the growth story on multiple enterprises. How are they like? What is the expansion? Is it more and more workflows being added in a more depth to the workflows, more features? Yeah. Can you walk us through maybe couple of examples of land and expand?

Is it more and more workflows being added in a more depth to the workflows, more features? Yeah. Can you walk us through maybe couple of examples of land and expand?
S Speaker 210:57Yeah, yeah. So I think there's two or three slides that we added towards and also, right? Yes, the usual, the journey is this, I can, I can take UWS examples specifically include as part of that, yeah, where we started with one use case there, which is basically saying, UW this 1000, 2000 developers company, yeah, a struggle that they were going with was they were doing CICD, the application bootstrapping. Like people write code they want to launch the service, update the service, right? And they were a few 100 getting launched every day, yeah, whenever the service update happened, that process was complex and flaky, because there are things in that, like, you know, putting a certificate, putting a DNS layer, like, you know, DNS updates are not deterministic. It can take from few seconds to 72 hours. So that made the whole process very flaky, right? And that's when they started to look at things like control and conductor and stuff like that. And then they landed up here, right? So that was the first use case. Then within the team that chose it right, like they really saw value, because their problems really got resolved and developed a productivity in the store in those few teams went up. So we landed back with, like a 280 K land. The next thing was, as this reliability story resonated, we pretty much got the whole company to kind of get their application more starting process on this, right? Okay, okay, as they were going through that, basically saying, like, hey, this the, you know, orca started to become this whole, like, this is something that's super glad, but if you want to build a viable stuff, use orcas, okay, so then they started to move their mortgage processing, mortgage payment processing applications.
Yeah, yeah. So I think there's two or three slides that we added towards and also, right? Yes, the usual, the journey is this, I can, I can take UWS examples specifically include as part of that, yeah, where we started with one use case there, which is basically saying, UW this 1000, 2000 developers company, yeah, a struggle that they were going with was they were doing CICD, the application bootstrapping.

S Speaker 112:36They expanded on different, different business use cases, or different, yeah, okay,
They expanded on different, different business use cases, or different, yeah, okay,
They expanded on different, different business use cases, or different, yeah, okay,
They expanded on different, different business use cases, or different, yeah, okay,
S Speaker 212:41yeah. So it is twofold. One is same use case. Bring more teams, yeah. Then bring other teams and other use cases, right? And that's how the expansions are being,
yeah. So it is twofold. One is same use case. Bring more teams, yeah. Then bring other teams and other use cases, right? And that's how the expansions are being,
yeah. So it is twofold. One is same use case. Bring more teams, yeah. Then bring other teams and other use cases, right? And that's how the expansions are being,
yeah. So it is twofold. One is same use case. Bring more teams, yeah. Then bring other teams and other use cases, right? And that's how the expansions are being,
S Speaker 112:51got it, got it, got it. And I think now the
got it, got it, got it. And I think now the
got it, got it, got it. And I think now the
got it, got it, got it. And I think now the
S Speaker 212:55next set of expansions is basically coming in from we are kind of doing the AWS playbook, saying, Hey, we are running a workflows, orchestrating the best support of a business. Yeah, if you look at AWS support of the business, was easy to and three every single product that they built around it with CDNs, API gateways, lambdas, it's all bringing opening up doors to compute and data storage, right? And we are basically same thing, right? Like, as we started to do workflows, the need for real time orchestration came up, and that's where the whole API platform packaging happened, yeah. Now, as that happened, we with API platform API gateways. Because, like, how do you get inside to API platform? Somebody is calling an API so that's a natural API gateway there. So you launched the API gateway, like you would have been. Basically, again, we use Kong inside the company. The other side of Kong is orchestration. If you already have a gateway, we don't need Kong anymore. So that opened up door to replace calm there,
next set of expansions is basically coming in from we are kind of doing the AWS playbook, saying, Hey, we are running a workflows, orchestrating the best support of a business.

13:52right? You replace Kong.
right? You replace Kong.
right? You replace Kong.
right? You replace Kong.
S Speaker 214:41So next thing is API gateways, adentic flows and other use cases those are. So we have a $2 million verbal thing that we already got with them in Jan. So that's basically, and then AI and API, you know, API platform use cases to follow after that,
So next thing is API gateways, adentic flows and other use cases those are. So we have a $2 million verbal thing that we already got with them in Jan. So that's basically, and then AI and API, you know, API platform use cases to follow after that,

So next thing is API gateways, adentic flows and other use cases those are. So we have a $2 million verbal thing that we already got with them in Jan. So that's basically, and then AI and API, you know, API platform use cases to follow after that,
S Speaker 114:59got it, got it. Got it. Yeah. So of the 10 million like, is like, how much is the top 10 customer contributing? Or top five? Is there concentration there?
got it, got it. Got it. Yeah. So of the 10 million like, is like, how much is the top 10 customer contributing? Or top five? Is there concentration there?
got it, got it. Got it. Yeah. So of the 10 million like, is like, how much is the top 10 customer contributing? Or top five? Is there concentration there?
got it, got it. Got it. Yeah. So of the 10 million like, is like, how much is the top 10 customer contributing? Or top five? Is there concentration there?
S Speaker 315:10Yeah. So two, which comes from UW, yeah,
Yeah. So two, which comes from UW, yeah,
Yeah. So two, which comes from UW, yeah,
Yeah. So two, which comes from UW, yeah,
S Speaker 215:16there is one coming in from
there is one coming in from
there is one coming in from
there is one coming in from
S Speaker 215:22quest, right? Foxtail is 670, something. Yeah, those are, I would say, the top three ones, and then the rest is across 50 different customers. Got it. Got
quest, right? Foxtail is 670, something. Yeah, those are, I would say, the top three ones, and then the rest is across 50 different customers. Got it. Got
quest, right? Foxtail is 670, something. Yeah, those are, I would say, the top three ones, and then the rest is across 50 different customers. Got it. Got
quest, right? Foxtail is 670, something. Yeah, those are, I would say, the top three ones, and then the rest is across 50 different customers. Got it. Got
S Speaker 415:31it. Oh, 5050, different customers. No, that's, that's even when
it. Oh, 5050, different customers. No, that's, that's even when
it. Oh, 5050, different customers. No, that's, that's even when
it. Oh, 5050, different customers. No, that's, that's even when
S Speaker 215:36we did the CDC, it was a similar distribution, right? Like, we were at 2 million Arr, like, you know, 25% was coming from three or four press, close account across 20 customers.
we did the CDC, it was a similar distribution, right? Like, we were at 2 million Arr, like, you know, 25% was coming from three or four press, close account across 20 customers.
we did the CDC, it was a similar distribution, right? Like, we were at 2 million Arr, like, you know, 25% was coming from three or four press, close account across 20 customers.
we did the CDC, it was a similar distribution, right? Like, we were at 2 million Arr, like, you know, 25% was coming from three or four press, close account across 20 customers.
S Speaker 115:45Yeah, I see, I see 15 customers, yeah, and you mentioned the API product and the agent product. Can we dissect the agent product a little bit? Because, yeah, I feel like the workflows for agents will be very different. How are they using conductor or your platform to do that?
Yeah, I see, I see 15 customers, yeah, and you mentioned the API product and the agent product. Can we dissect the agent product a little bit? Because, yeah, I feel like the workflows for agents will be very different. How are they using conductor or your platform to do that?
Yeah, I see, I see 15 customers, yeah, and you mentioned the API product and the agent product. Can we dissect the agent product a little bit? Because, yeah, I feel like the workflows for agents will be very different. How are they using conductor or your platform to do that?
Yeah, I see, I see 15 customers, yeah, and you mentioned the API product and the agent product. Can we dissect the agent product a little bit? Because, yeah, I feel like the workflows for agents will be very different. How are they using conductor or your platform to do that?
S Speaker 216:01Yeah, yeah. So we have two things, right? So one is the agent thick platform that always out there. The second one is the AI. So we are doing a fully we are building a platform for doing fully autonomous AI agents that's going to come into you for right? But the current platform that we have right now now, think of it this, like in the enterprise. How is adentic stuff different from how we use the consumer? So today, what are the products that are taken off in AI world, right? Including chat, GPT, cursor, lovable coding, chat, right? That's the biggest consumer world, right? That's where you're seeing this, right? The big difference in enterprises is enterprise, and workflows are very deterministic. So let's say KYC flows, payment processing. You're doing a flow. At the end of it, you want an answer, can I accept this computer or this vendor on my platform? Yes or No, right? Or in a transaction flow, is there fraud in this thing? Yes or no? Can I, you know, if the transaction goes through, give me the transaction ID so that I can do something else with it, right? Yeah. So where deterministic flows or a mortgage processing application, right? Like, can I accept this mortgage? Can I send this to everybody to have all the data, right? Yeah. In the big challenge with AI is AI adds non deterministic behavior, of course, of course, that is the biggest challenge. Now, the product direction here has been, and also the GTA portions have been. You have this broad workflow, which is a bunch of steps, yeah, identify few things inside that which AI can be really good at, and the next step, if it is naturally, either a human in the loop. So in the example that I sent earlier, right? So, underwriting this, there's an act of human in the group, right? Yeah, anything that comes before that is something that AI can do it, they can present the results of that AI through this, yeah, we also have human in the loop right there, right? Yeah. So this is what is very important, right? Like saying, if you're doing anything that is non deterministic. Do that you get all the efficiencies, but validate that with the human right like, this is an or basically the new thing that we're doing. We're basically saying, if you want to move autonomous action, put some guardrails around it. Code based guardrails, semantic guardrails, saying, yes, the agent can take action on you, but when the AI is wrong because you build constraints around that agent will not take action. And then you can route back to a human using a native even in the loop stuff, or go back to the traditional flow site. And this is what is extremely important. Again, I enterprise the CA, there's a lot of value for AI, when it goes wrong, I don't want it to take actions that I you know. I want to say what it can take actions on. So that's one piece. Second piece is AI. When you look at AI like they want to have control on which providers they can, you know, open it to the company. The interface to all of these providers are llms, yeah. And today, the way people write is like, hey, these, these prompts are all over the place, right? Files inside core statements sitting everywhere. So there's no natural need for a prompt registry so where people can go and validate that, and they can also say, hey, these prompts are validated. These are the applications that users. You can use them. So they want governance and control on that, because that's where data leakage happens. And because data leakage happens there, they want these things that are operating with AI to be sitting inside consumers cloud accounts. So paring on a VPC and saying that, hey, I'll give you access to my data. But this has to sit inside this. I need to know who's talking to which models, auditing and all of those things. And so carving out a VPC boundary and saying, Hey, everything can be installed in your account. You have full control over your data, right? These are the things that has resonated really well with enterprises
Yeah, yeah. So we have two things, right? So one is the agent thick platform that always out there. The second one is the AI. So we are doing a fully we are building a platform for doing fully autonomous AI agents that's going to come into you for right? But the current platform that we have right now now, think of it this, like in the enterprise. How is adentic stuff different from how we use the consumer? So today, what are the products that are taken off in AI world, right? Including chat, GPT, cursor, lovable coding, chat, right? That's the biggest consumer world, right? That's where you're seeing this, right? The big difference in enterprises is enterprise, and workflows are very deterministic. So let's say KYC flows, payment processing. You're doing a flow. At the end of it, you want an answer, can I accept this computer or this vendor on my platform? Yes or No, right? Or in a transaction flow, is there fraud in this thing? Yes or no? Can I, you know, if the transaction goes through, give me the transaction ID so that I can do something else with it, right? Yeah. So where deterministic flows or a mortgage processing application, right? Like, can I accept this mortgage? Can I send this to everybody to have all the data, right? Yeah. In the big challenge with AI is AI adds non deterministic behavior, of course, of course, that is the biggest challenge. Now, the product direction here has been, and also the GTA portions have been. You have this broad workflow, which is a bunch of steps, yeah, identify few things inside that which AI can be really good at, and the next step, if it is naturally, either a human in the loop. So in the example that I sent earlier, right? So, underwriting this, there's an act of human in the group, right? Yeah, anything that comes before that is something that AI can do it, they can present the results of that AI through this, yeah, we also have human in the loop right there, right? Yeah. So this is what is very important, right? Like saying, if you're doing anything that is non deterministic. Do that you get all the efficiencies, but validate that with the human right like, this is an or basically the new thing that we're doing. We're basically saying, if you want to move autonomous action, put some guardrails around it. Code based guardrails, semantic guardrails, saying, yes, the agent can take action on you, but when the AI is wrong because you build constraints around that agent will not take action. And then you can route back to a human using a native even in the loop stuff, or go back to the traditional flow site. And this is what is extremely important. Again, I enterprise the CA, there's a lot of value for AI, when it goes wrong, I don't want it to take actions that I you know. I want to say what it can take actions on. So that's one piece. Second piece is AI. When you look at AI like they want to have control on which providers they can, you know, open it to the company. The interface to all of these providers are llms, yeah.

These are the things that has resonated really well with enterprises
S Speaker 119:51so far. And are you so I would assume that a lot of these AI application companies can leverage your product, right? Are you seeing any so enterprises, I get, but enterprises is behind in deploying these AI apps or AI agents in production, but a lot of these, like coding agents or even sales marketing agents. Are you seeing any adoption there or not yet?
so far. And are you so I would assume that a lot of these AI application companies can leverage your product, right?

Are you seeing any adoption there or not yet?
S Speaker 220:16Yeah, so there are few like, you know, there are, I think, like there was this company called lyric.ai, lyric is supply chain, right? Yeah, they are doing supply chain, but they're also doing something for their, you know, customers as well, right? Saying, yeah, they're building the tooling on the top of this for their customers, right? So the bunch of stuff that they are using us as a platform and building the agentic flows on us, right? So when they go and basically ask an agent to do an action, the going the back and forth on, asking the agent a question, coming back with an answer, don't like it, go and redo that back and forth till you get to a point where then you like the results, and automating that whole process on that agent and workflow platform, these are something that we have seen. Customers are kind of users. For the second one we have seen is, you know, things like fraud detection. You have messages that are coming into Kafka pipeline say, hey, there's, there's this particular transaction that happened, running into fraud detection models, which is like Edith based, and then either looking at guardrails logic, or bubbling it up to, you know, people, anything that's more than $100 if it is, like hitting this, like, you know, bubble it up to, you know, someone to can go and take a look at so, a bunch of different use case, but from a platforming level as well, I think we have roughly, I would say, Like, 10 to 15% today for coming in a customer. Base who use us to build other customized workflow platforms. Okay? Customized, okay,
Yeah, so there are few like, you know, there are, I think, like there was this company called lyric.ai, lyric is supply chain, right? Yeah, they are doing supply chain, but they're also doing something for their, you know, customers as well, right?

S Speaker 122:13well, by the way, on the founder side. How many founders are there? And are they all together, still the company or planning to any color.
well, by the way, on the founder side. How many founders are there? And are they all together, still the company or planning to any color.
well, by the way, on the founder side. How many founders are there? And are they all together, still the company or planning to any color.
well, by the way, on the founder side. How many founders are there? And are they all together, still the company or planning to any color.
22:21Yeah? So no. So we
S Speaker 222:24have 23 founders. When we originally started, we had four, right, like, so one person is no longer with us, but we are now three founder company. Yeah,
have 23 founders. When we originally started, we had four, right, like, so one person is no longer with us, but we are now three founder company. Yeah,
have 23 founders. When we originally started, we had four, right, like, so one person is no longer with us, but we are now three founder company. Yeah,
have 23 founders. When we originally started, we had four, right, like, so one person is no longer with us, but we are now three founder company. Yeah,
S Speaker 222:57There are, think, couple of companies that we have seen in the past before.com, was one, VMware newspaper, few use cases? Yeah, I think there's three or four companies that we know that they are, that they are using. Like,
There are, think, couple of companies that we have seen in the past before.com, was one, VMware newspaper, few use cases? Yeah, I think there's three or four companies that we know that they are, that they are using. Like,
There are, think, couple of companies that we have seen in the past before.com, was one, VMware newspaper, few use cases? Yeah, I think there's three or four companies that we know that they are, that they are using. Like,
There are, think, couple of companies that we have seen in the past before.com, was one, VMware newspaper, few use cases? Yeah, I think there's three or four companies that we know that they are, that they are using. Like,
S Speaker 123:13Oh, that'll be great if, if we can just talk about the use case, because it just makes it easier for me to socialize this internally because so we have a lot of automotive IoT workflows where data is coming in in streams, right? But a lot of this has to go into a workflow, right? And this is being built manually, right? Somebody is writing the if and else logic, right? It's yeah. So I think orchid, orchids can fit in there, right?
Oh, that'll be great if, if we can just talk about the use case, because it just makes it easier for me to socialize this internally because so we have a lot of automotive IoT workflows where data is coming in in streams, right?

So I think orchid, orchids can fit in there, right?
S Speaker 223:43Yeah, both, Broadcom, VMware, they're all open source usage. The Nokia also uses this for IoT purposes, yeah, I think their open source usage is also massive, right? Like, but I can, if you can tell me which kind of industry and use cases they're
Yeah, both, Broadcom, VMware, they're all open source usage. The Nokia also uses this for IoT purposes, yeah, I think their open source usage is also massive, right? Like, but I can, if you can tell me which kind of industry and use cases they're

S Speaker 524:45Priyesh, any questions on your end? Not really due. Maybe we'd like to go a little bit deeper on the agentic specific features you have built around state preservation, tool failure handling, things like that. But maybe we can do that on the demo side. So why do we Why did we do this?
Priyesh, any questions on your end? Not really due. Maybe we'd like to go a little bit deeper on the agentic specific features you have built around state preservation, tool failure handling, things like that. But maybe we can do that on the demo side. So why do we Why did we do this?

S Speaker 125:00Joe, so if you've signed the term sheet, right, let us know how much we can maybe talk about the, you know, the distribution, or who's the lead, and how much you're willing to raise and and then let us come back to you with a potential timeline and what, what are the next steps from our end? Right? So, yeah, you know, plan is to bring this for a partner meeting on Monday, right? So we'll have some initial feedback, but, but, yeah, we are playing catch up. As you know, we are late in the round, so give us some time, and hopefully, you know, we can make this work, but, but a lot of work has to be done before that. So any any color on the round that you can change,

S Speaker 127:22so we've done it, but it's not a preferred path. So just to be very clear, it's not something that, you know, yeah, it comes with a little bit of color to it. So we would prefer primary over secondary, but just being open about it, right? So, I mean,
