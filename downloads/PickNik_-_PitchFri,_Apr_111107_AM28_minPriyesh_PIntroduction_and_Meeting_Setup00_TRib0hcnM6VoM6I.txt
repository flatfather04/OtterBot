S Speaker 20:37Okay. Well, fantastic. Well, thanks for taking the call. I think if everything went right, you've already received a copy of our pitch deck. So maybe what we could do is, I'd love to learn just a little bit more about Qualcomm from the investment side you're looking for and then glad to either jump into our pitch deck or answer questions you have

S Speaker 10:57absolutely Dave, I can give you a background and then happy to pass it over. So I am an investor at Qualcomm ventures, particularly looking at the at a investments in the past. I've worked with Menlo Ventures for a short period of time, and with mortal ventures in LA and then, originally from India, I've worked with a lot of early stage startups. So have an operator side of things. And now been in VC for about two and a half years. The fund itself. We have been around for 25 years. We are the corporate venture arm of Paul comes to touch the balance sheet. And while we are as corporate venture arm, we do have a very financial mandate to the decisions we make. So the decisions are made independently, and we have to follow the same financial discipline as any other venture fund would. Apart from that, we invest in IoT, computer vision, industrial automation, automobile tech stack, AI in AI, the entire tech stack in robotics as well in AI, we have made several investments in application and infrastructure foundation models, and now we are also very particularly looking at physical AI as one of the spaces. We have talked to a few foundation model companies building the brains for robots, if you will. And that's where I feel it's a very interesting spot for move IT pro, for us to discuss as well. And then our check sizes are two to $15 million we are typically a Series A investor, but we do seed as well, opportunistically,

S Speaker 12:47we have looked at. We haven't invested. We are in the process of discussing a few of them. We are also talking to a lot of robotics companies, the big names, as if you will. So it's a very strategically relevant area for us as well. We feel a lot of compute that will happen on robotics would be using Qualcomm chips, because I have the best power to efficiency ratio, if you will. So, so it's also a very strategically relevant area where we looking at a few investments down the line this

S Speaker 13:30at the moment, not at the moment. So what we look at is, if any of these companies go down the line become Qualcomm's customer, use our products, or even have any engineering partnerships. So in that aspect, I feel we do not have to have a set really synergy, but we just want to sort of think of a path to it down the way,

S Speaker 14:15I think you're raising a 5 million round. So it may fit in our check sizes. That's why I wanted to evaluate this as well and post this call. I would like to have a call with the team, and then we can decide on that as well.

S Speaker 14:39gone through the deck, Dave and I am sold on the opportunity. We are looking at a lot of companies here, so we understand that the opportunities like looking at software companies in the space as well. What I'd love is if you can take me through the product deck that you had. I was just growing through it, and it's very dense. I enjoyed reading through it, but would love to see how you thinking about it. What are the use cases? How the platform is today? How are some of the customers using it today? And then talk a bit more about JTM, down the line,

S Speaker 25:08right? Okay, great. Glad to do that. So, yeah. So did you remind me, if you would, what did you see? Did you just see our pitch deck? Or do we also sent you? We have a product tour.
right? Okay, great. Glad to do that. So, yeah. So did you remind me, if you would, what did you see? Did you just see our pitch deck? Or do we also sent you? We have a product tour.

S Speaker 25:55I'm actually just going to show you one or two slides from the from the picture tech first. So because I want to start with a high level vision, you know. So what we're looking to do is bring human light capabilities to robots of many different form factors. So you'll notice in the pitch deck, we have a little fun take a little poke to bipedal humanoids. There's nothing wrong with them. They'll have their place someday. Elon will be correct, and there'll be a bazillion of them running around the world, but we do take a little poke at it, because there's what I'm looking showing here is just a huge market already, and it's going to get even bigger in terms of the market, up beyond a bipedal human weights. And so we see what we call mobile manipulation is the fastest growing part of our business. So that's represented by this, this middle, you know, section here can be anything from industrial sanitation, cleaning, etc, like that. NASA has this to our project for mobile manipulation robot to actually do things on the moon, etc, like that. So it's huge. So that's kind of my point. And then so that kind of sets up, you know, really the product toward deck, which I'll switch, switch over to. And so we've got all these core capabilities. And the way you think about, I think our product is maybe along three lines. So one which is, it's an open platform that runs on commodity hardware, right? So it's really important that we feel it's part of our value proposition. Dwell on us. I know you want to get into deep part of the tech, right? So this is on our website. These are all the different robotic brands that are supported, right? So all the different arms you can now get into end effectors and things like this. This is critically important, because already it's opening up a huge number of new use cases that before didn't have a good ROI on them. And so, for example, like you, you know, you probably saw on the deck we featured BMW, etc. I was telling the BMW story to stellantis And the guy in the RV Center, well, we did that two years ago. Well, then he had to admit that he did it with a very high end vision system, that the vision system alone cost $50,000 I said, Well, we're doing that use case with a $1,000 Ed camera. So anyways, very important to understand part of our value proposition is an open platform, writing on commodity hardware. So we get the advantage of writing those price curves down, and the combinations and permutations of hardware are just going to explode over the next few years. Now, kind of it will jump into the product tour a little bit. And so within the product, think of it kind of multiple different, two main areas of value proposition, one which is our rapid development environment, and I'm going to start there in just a minute, and then our core algorithms and capabilities, right? So the core algorithms give this capability to do, for example, object recognition, you know, dynamic path planning, like that. So I'm going to, I'm going to come back to that. So if I skip ahead to the development platform, so it's a low code drag and drop development platform, so you can see we talked about is a 200 pre storage skills over here on the left side, what you do is you name the application that you want to create. This one called harvesting strawberries. BMW would call it a chaotic pick a precise place, and then either the customer or us, working on their behalf or together, we would then go pick out one of the right skills, as we call them, on the left hand side, those, we drag them, drop them over here, the right side. And I don't know if you've ever heard of behavior tree. This is a behavior tree structure, right? So, yeah. So we pop it into behavior tree. There's multiple reasons why that's really advantageous, you know, one which is, as we look to create these human like capabilities, things that humans take for granted, the ability to do one thing, make sure it completes successfully, followed by the next, by the next. And so behavior tree, putting that logic is really useful for that. And so the developer can think about it that way, and also an execution it can run that way. We can also through these behaviors. We can pop out, through a behavior, out to a foundation model. And so that's a good thing for me to segue into, maybe just briefly, is so we don't have our own foundation model. What we do is we have an open connector as an onyx connector, so we can connect out to any foundation model out there. We think that's the right strategy for us for a couple different reasons. One which is, it's early days in the foundation models, you know, to see who's going to leapfrog who like that. And so our value proposition is we already have our deterministic algorithms. We've got those enhanced with AI, and then for these advanced robot learning thing, bring those in where it's appropriate and they're not appropriate. That's a lot of people miss on the foundation models. They're not appropriate for every use case or every part of the use case. And what they definitely also need, just like chat GPT hallucinates. So do robotic foundation models, right? So they need safeguards. What we have in beta, in fact, we're going to record a video on it, probably here next week is so actually, you can use a large language model as input in this. So you could just type in a pick part out of the bin, you know, type of thing, and to go do that, that's that's a beta version to see that so you can see, you can type it in. The existing production systems are based on this drag and drop model. Another thing we do into part of the development platform is a really advanced simulation environment. Two main differences from kind of a typical one, a lot of simulation, nothing more than a dressed up video of what happens. And so what you like to see here is, when we create a digital simulation, we're doing, we're actually creating the application, right? So you'll see the behavior tree up in the right hand corner for this simple pouring a liquid in a lab environment, video, right? So we're actually creating the application. So one of the really great things about that is, in a digital mode, we can have an unlimited number of developers working on the application, right? And so a big customer like General Motors. Who's got a lot of developers, they can all be working on the same one. They're not fighting for access if they want us to work on the same time as they are in quickly so we can compress that time to advance the applications. So that's one of the big advantages. Second thing is, you'll notice it's a physics based simulation. It's very rare in simulations. It's super important. You know, a couple of our early customers are, you know, NASA and space and so they work in, you know, low gravity and zero gravity environment. That's why we had to come out with the ability to simulate physics, because if you push on a satellite too hard, etc, causes problems. But it's also extremely useful, you know, here on Earth as well. So you think about mobile manipulation and kind of all these humanoids simulate, you know, how far is the robotic arm extended? How much weight does it have before that becomes the pain problem? You know, for example, that's one of the reasons why at superport.
I'm actually just going to show you one or two slides from the from the picture tech first. So because I want to start with a high level vision, you know. So what we're looking to do is bring human light capabilities to robots of many different form factors.

I'm actually just going to show you one or two slides from the from the picture tech first. So because I want to start with a high level vision, you know. So what we're looking to do is bring human light capabilities to robots of many different form factors. So you'll notice in the pitch deck, we have a little fun take a little poke to bipedal humanoids. There's nothing wrong with them. They'll have their place someday. Elon will be correct, and there'll be a bazillion of them running around the world, but we do take a little poke at it, because there's what I'm looking showing here is just a huge market already, and it's going to get even bigger in terms of the market, up beyond a bipedal human weights. And so we see what we call mobile manipulation is the fastest growing part of our business. So that's represented by this, this middle, you know, section here can be anything from industrial sanitation, cleaning, etc, like that. NASA has this to our project for mobile manipulation robot to actually do things on the moon, etc, like that. So it's huge. So that's kind of my point. And then so that kind of sets up, you know, really the product toward deck, which I'll switch, switch over to. And so we've got all these core capabilities. And the way you think about, I think our product is maybe along three lines. So one which is, it's an open platform that runs on commodity hardware, right? So it's really important that we feel it's part of our value proposition. Dwell on us. I know you want to get into deep part of the tech, right? So this is on our website. These are all the different robotic brands that are supported, right? So all the different arms you can now get into end effectors and things like this. This is critically important, because already it's opening up a huge number of new use cases that before didn't have a good ROI on them. And so, for example, like you, you know, you probably saw on the deck we featured BMW, etc. I was telling the BMW story to stellantis And the guy in the RV Center, well, we did that two years ago. Well, then he had to admit that he did it with a very high end vision system, that the vision system alone cost $50,000 I said, Well, we're doing that use case with a $1,000 Ed camera. So anyways, very important to understand part of our value proposition is an open platform, writing on commodity hardware. So we get the advantage of writing those price curves down, and the combinations and permutations of hardware are just going to explode over the next few years. Now, kind of it will jump into the product tour a little bit. And so within the product, think of it kind of multiple different, two main areas of value proposition, one which is our rapid development environment, and I'm going to start there in just a minute, and then our core algorithms and capabilities, right? So the core algorithms give this capability to do, for example, object recognition, you know, dynamic path planning, like that. So I'm going to, I'm going to come back to that. So if I skip ahead to the development platform, so it's a low code drag and drop development platform, so you can see we talked about is a 200 pre storage skills over here on the left side, what you do is you name the application that you want to create. This one called harvesting strawberries. BMW would call it a chaotic pick a precise place, and then either the customer or us, working on their behalf or together, we would then go pick out one of the right skills, as we call them, on the left hand side, those, we drag them, drop them over here, the right side. And I don't know if you've ever heard of behavior tree. This is a behavior tree structure, right? So, yeah. So we pop it into behavior tree. There's multiple reasons why that's really advantageous, you know, one which is, as we look to create these human like capabilities, things that humans take for granted, the ability to do one thing, make sure it completes successfully, followed by the next, by the next. And so behavior tree, putting that logic is really useful for that. And so the developer can think about it that way, and also an execution it can run that way. We can also through these behaviors. We can pop out, through a behavior, out to a foundation model. And so that's a good thing for me to segue into, maybe just briefly, is so we don't have our own foundation model. What we do is we have an open connector as an onyx connector, so we can connect out to any foundation model out there. We think that's the right strategy for us for a couple different reasons. One which is, it's early days in the foundation models, you know, to see who's going to leapfrog who like that. And so our value proposition is we already have our deterministic algorithms. We've got those enhanced with AI, and then for these advanced robot learning thing, bring those in where it's appropriate and they're not appropriate. That's a lot of people miss on the foundation models. They're not appropriate for every use case or every part of the use case. And what they definitely also need, just like chat GPT hallucinates. So do robotic foundation models, right? So they need safeguards. What we have in beta, in fact, we're going to record a video on it, probably here next week is so actually, you can use a large language model as input in this. So you could just type in a pick part out of the bin, you know, type of thing, and to go do that, that's that's a beta version to see that so you can see, you can type it in. The existing production systems are based on this drag and drop model. Another thing we do into part of the development platform is a really advanced simulation environment. Two main differences from kind of a typical one, a lot of simulation, nothing more than a dressed up video of what happens. And so what you like to see here is, when we create a digital simulation, we're doing, we're actually creating the application, right? So you'll see the behavior tree up in the right hand corner for this simple pouring a liquid in a lab environment, video, right? So we're actually creating the application. So one of the really great things about that is, in a digital mode, we can have an unlimited number of developers working on the application, right? And so a big customer like General Motors. Who's got a lot of developers, they can all be working on the same one. They're not fighting for access if they want us to work on the same time as they are in quickly so we can compress that time to advance the applications. So that's one of the big advantages. Second thing is, you'll notice it's a physics based simulation. It's very rare in simulations. It's super important. You know, a couple of our early customers are, you know, NASA and space and so they work in, you know, low gravity and zero gravity environment. That's why we had to come out with the ability to simulate physics, because if you push on a satellite too hard, etc, causes problems. But it's also extremely useful, you know, here on Earth as well. So you think about mobile manipulation and kind of all these humanoids simulate, you know, how far is the robotic arm extended? How much weight does it have before that becomes the pain problem? You know, for example, that's one of the reasons why at superport.

S Speaker 119:03to sort of double click on that a little bit. How did BMW go about it? I can assume you have pre built in perception capabilities, like you mentioned on the platform, but you would have had to fine tune the algorithms for this specific use case. Trade it on a lot of similar pictures of the product. How did BMW go about it? Is that the service that you provide is that something that the platform automatically has, and BMW can use it,

S Speaker 219:29right? Yeah. So it's a great question, because so another thing that we just include in the platform is what we call reference applications, or you might think of those as starter applications, right? And so this was a starter application, you know, machine learning power. It'll pick in place, so it already has the capability. What you're seeing here is the machine learning does the segmentation to understand the orientation of these objects and different things like that, right? So they started off with this as a base level to get off to the fast start, and then, yeah, so this is actually an early version of, actually their particular application, obviously the different parts the one I'm showing you, right? So they build upon, you know, that reference application to get off to a quick
right? Yeah. So it's a great question, because so another thing that we just include in the platform is what we call reference applications, or you might think of those as starter applications, right?

S Speaker 120:17start, got it for a BMW to sort of create this digital twin of their own custom parts. How do we go about it? Is that also a part of the platform? Yes,

S Speaker 220:28yeah, the digital twin is actually part of the platform. So what I was showing you before, in terms of dragging and dropping and so actually, with the reference application, you would actually that behavior tree would be pre, pre, filled with a lot of behaviors, right? And then you just go and modify those behaviors. That's one, one of the things that BMW really liked it, and why they selected us, was because they were looking for an open platform to them. Open means, you know, two things, one, which is hardware agnostic, like we just talked about, right? Because they want to have their choice over on the body shop. They have three vendors, ABB, coca panic, but they all have their own proprietary stack, and it creates an architecture and nightmare for them, right? And so open, they want it to be hardware agnostic. And the second way they think of open is they assume that nothing they could buy would ever have 100% of the capability they need. So those behaviors that I showed you, you can go in, there's C Plus Plus. You can go in and modify those behaviors. You can go in and write and add your own behaviors and skills like that. That was critically important

S Speaker 121:37to them. And if you mentioned c plus plus, so on the on the behavior chart that you create, do you come across situations wherein the deterministic logic just has a constraint and you cannot, sort of come up to the you cannot target the edge cases there and then? Do you have a features for a BMW or a customer to fine tune the application particularly and treat a very high level of fidelity.

S Speaker 224:28Three new customers this this week. One was axiom, which is a space company. Another one's called Auto wash, which is actually a company looking to use robots for car washing, because they can use 1/3 the water, 1/3 the chemicals and 1/3 the electricity. We're having another good year. Just, yeah, the process updating the deck, I said 21 customers. We're now up to 26 so we're accelerating traction. We are now, just think we're a couple dollars under 500 in ARR, if we're $400,000 in ARR now. So our goal is to get the 1.4 million in ARR by the end of the year. That is somewhat dependent on the investment right now we are terribly constrained in terms of sales side, it's just myself and the founder the only sales resources more of a definite path to get there. Might have seen also one of our customers, hypox, already has orders for 5000 units, and so they contracted with us for the first 500 licenses, so those will begin to revenue in the fourth quarter. Yeah. And you may have seen part of our business model, what we do is we go onto the platform with a development license, generally in the range of 25 to $50,000 a year. And then where there's a huge benefit to our economic engine is when they go and roll out onto production, because there's a license out of that. The nice thing about that is it becomes annuity, and there's very little sales expense at that point, right? So

We are now, just think we're a couple dollars under 500 in ARR, if we're $400,000 in ARR now. So our goal is to get the 1.4 million in ARR by the end of the year. That is somewhat dependent on the investment right now we are terribly constrained in terms of sales side, it's just myself and the founder the only sales resources more of a definite path to get there. Might have seen also one of our customers, hypox, already has orders for 5000 units, and so they contracted with us for the first 500 licenses, so those will begin to revenue in the fourth quarter. Yeah. And you may have seen part of our business model, what we do is we go onto the platform with a development license, generally in the range of 25 to $50,000 a year. And then where there's a huge benefit to our economic engine is when they go and roll out onto production, because there's a license out of that. The nice thing about that is it becomes annuity, and there's very little sales expense at that point, right? So
S Speaker 126:09that's, that's exciting, Dave, so you have a license when a robot which was trained on your platform goes into production. Is that true? That's correct. That's, that's exciting business model. I haven't heard of that so far. That's good to know,

S Speaker 226:25yeah, because it's, you know, I mean, we've invested $15 million into the platform. And so our customers, most of them, you know, either came from companies that try to do a custom in house, and they know that's what it takes to do these sophisticated applications. It's millions and millions of dollars and so. But if you're a robotic startup, or even if you're a group within, inside of a company like BMW, you know, they don't want to take on the multi million dollar expense up front, right? So that's why we give them an affordable, you know, path in, right? So it's we got to go here. But this is a path, affordable path, in onto the platform, and then the real power of the economic model, you know, kicks in as they scale up, and that's what we're illustrating here. So in the case of hypoxic, as they roll out all 5000 units, they'll get quantity discounts, bringing them down to $500 per but that's still two and a half million dollars from a single customer for us,
yeah, because it's, you know, I mean, we've invested $15 million into the platform.

S Speaker 127:23Dave quickly on, how much have you raised so far? Is this and some dynamics about this current round? Is it going to be safe? Do you have a gap in mind? Is it going to be priced things like

S Speaker 227:35that? Yeah. So we did a pre seed round previously that was a $1 million investment that was done on a safe $25 million cap. And so we're, we're open at this round as to whether this adds on to the safe, or whether it comes through as a price drop.
that? Yeah. So we did a pre seed round previously that was a $1 million investment that was done on a safe $25 million cap. And so we're, we're open at this round as to whether this adds on to the safe, or whether it comes through as a price drop.

S Speaker 127:54Got it and any are you looking at a timeline to close? Because typically our process takes four to five weeks. So just wanted to be clear on that,

S Speaker 128:14Dave, that makes more sense. Let me come back with some follow up questions by early next week or mid next week, and then would like to set up a follow up. Appreciative time today, Dave, thanks a lot for this.
