0:07Honestly, we Hello.
S Speaker 10:11Hey, Hi, Melissa, hi Jeffrey, how are you guys doing

absolutely my pleasure. I'm doing great. Thank you.
S Speaker 20:21It was just about to mention to Jeff that we had only met for, I think maybe three or four minutes so completely he hasn't missed it for a great deal of introduction.

S Speaker 10:33Yeah, that event was such high throughput, and everyone was going around, so we just could catch up for a few minutes. But yeah, I'm glad that we got a chance to reconnect again?

S Speaker 20:42Yep, certainly. And just for sort of quick background, Jeff is our Boston based partner and sort of our leading technologist and operator and and so I figured it would make sense for us all to catch up together. Probably be great to use them. So I think happy to give maybe a quick refresher on SAP as as a fund, and then perhaps Jeff can also dive into our HPC and sort of silicon thesis as well, if that makes sense to start there. And also would be great to sort of learn more about Qualcomm ventures. Absolutely.

S Speaker 15:16I don't remember because I wasn't with the team back then.

S Speaker 35:21So, but it's super, super. He's been the CTO for, I don't know, 20 years or something, just an exceptionally bright, capable guy. But I couldn't find his name this morning. But yeah, please, if you don't mind, great. Just to get a brief introduction from your side, absolutely.

S Speaker 15:35So yeah, the Qualcomm ventures team, we are a single LP Qualcomm is our single LP fund, and we are a global fund. We have offices in the Bay Area. Some of our members are in San Diego, where the Qualcomm headquarters is, apart from that outside the US. We have an office in Brazil, one in Israel, one in China and in India. In the US investment team, we have a mandate of deploying capital of about 150 $280 million a year. So we are actively looking at deploying capital right now, and our focus areas broadly tend to be across the broad thesis of Qualcomm being a major player in Compute and connectivity. So any downstream technologies which can be enabled through our compute infrastructure, or networking infrastructure, is something that gets us excited. Over the years, we have made a lot of AI infrastructure investments so scale AI, hugging, face, weights and biases, anthropic are some of the notable names in there. We are focusing quite a lot on AI applications right now. Apart from that, we have made a lot of investments in computer vision companies, so industrial automation, security using computer vision. And then we've made investments in XR where Qualcomm also is a big player in we have made investments in IoT tech stack, automobile tech stack, and those are areas that we broadly look at, but the fund operates quite independent of Qualcomm, so we act as a financial VC, and the decisions that we take are quite independent of Qualcomm. While we do take a look at some synergies that brought down the line whether this could be this the company that we invest in could serve as an acquisition target, or can either serve as a software vendor to Qualcomm, but that's very small part of our decision making. Our check sizes are roughly two to ten million we are a Series A investor. More recently, we have started doing some seeds, especially in AI, because it was kind of what the market mandated us to do. But our sweet spot would be five to ten million I'd say, and we lead about 20% of our investments. We lead most of the times we follow. So that's probably it. I guess the team has been around for 25 years or no or so right now, we manage about 250 active portfolio companies have more than a billion dollars in asset in the management. Fantastic. Did I miss anything? Is there any specific question? No,
So yeah, the Qualcomm ventures team, we are a single LP Qualcomm is our single LP fund, and we are a global fund. We have offices in the Bay Area.

S Speaker 38:09knowing that. You know, we run our 17 companies. I want to know how big a team you have to run, 250

8:17it's quite remarkable.
it's quite remarkable.
it's quite remarkable.
it's quite remarkable.
S Speaker 18:18I know, yeah, just the fact that we do not take board director seats at most of our investments, and we prefer to just have a board observer seat. That makes it easy, but I get your point. Yeah,
I know, yeah, just the fact that we do not take board director seats at most of our investments, and we prefer to just have a board observer seat. That makes it easy, but I get your point. Yeah,

I know, yeah, just the fact that we do not take board director seats at most of our investments, and we prefer to just have a board observer seat. That makes it easy, but I get your point. Yeah,
S Speaker 38:31we do tend to take board seats where we casually take observer seats, but our value add to your point tends to be mostly in Japan and Japanese focused, Asian market entry. We don't do a lot of support. We're really investing in teams that are capable of getting to a C round, at least without major enhancement. So you know another reason that we look late seed, if the teams are really well formed, but prefer a and you know, also where they've gotten far enough that we can see the applicability to the Japanese market. And just the only thing to stress is, like you, we're not looking for applicability for any particular company. We act as an independent we work with KDDI. We work with NTT we work with Softbank, it's we really are advocates and navigators, let's say, for our portfolio companies, as opposed to working with any particular, any particular group, as I'm sure you've seen, Japan can be a particularly challenging ecosystem for young companies?

S Speaker 19:42Yeah. I'm curious on the fact that, how do you actually select which companies arrive for Japanese expansion at the time? Is there any specific industries you focus on, any specific stage of companies or kind of product in that sense?
Yeah. I'm curious on the fact that, how do you actually select which companies arrive for Japanese expansion at the time? Is there any specific industries you focus on, any specific stage of companies or kind of product in that sense?
Yeah. I'm curious on the fact that, how do you actually select which companies arrive for Japanese expansion at the time? Is there any specific industries you focus on, any specific stage of companies or kind of product in that sense?
Yeah. I'm curious on the fact that, how do you actually select which companies arrive for Japanese expansion at the time? Is there any specific industries you focus on, any specific stage of companies or kind of product in that sense?
S Speaker 39:55Yeah. And that's, you know, this is perhaps our biggest differentiation. I mean, NTT has plenty of CDC money out and about which, which acts as a more typical CDC, typically looking at direct benefit to a group company within 18 to 24 months, you know, more or less, and that's super important. But we literally were caused to be created by the former chairman of NTT, to be looking at billion dollar revenue markets that have applicable applicability to Japan, 578, years down the road. So a very different approach to be a compliment. So our first question comes back to your question is, what is the potential market size? So we're really looking not at necessarily smaller add ons or component level, but people who are taking some significant risk to disrupt a larger industry. And that's our mandate. And, you know, we stick we very thesis driven, as Melissa said, we're quite flexible in all sorts of terms. But our, you know, our thesis driven approach is quite, quite straightforward. The at least half of our diligence is taken on by our Japan team. We tend to also have very extensive University connections in Japan. So not so I mean both core technology, but also applicability and market relevance. So you know, we'd be unlikely to do an insurance product that has super potential, but doesn't work within the Japanese ecosystem for regulatory or for whatever potential reasonably be unlikely. I'll just give a quick example. There's a perovskite, sort of very thin film solar panels that we were I love the company, yeah. And the competition in Japan is so heavy, the government has put a fortune into this. It just was swimming upstream, so to speak. So we didn't do that one. So these are just some short example. And we really, and again, from a technological standpoint, we have a very deep tie into to four or five of the major research universities, and both for technical diligence, and then, you know, also for market applicability. So it's a comprehensive approach to the market that starts with the technology and finishes with with market relevance.
Yeah. And that's, you know, this is perhaps our biggest differentiation.

S Speaker 212:37In terms of sectors of interest, we're certainly focused on AI infrastructure, high performance compute, a lot of grid technology also that supports, I think, general thesis as well. So we're investors in the long duration energy storage battery, but also across next generation compute. So we've done a few investments in autonomous compute, quantum and then also in memory compute. And so it's quite a broad mandate, but it sort of all does end up connecting back together into the Japanese market quite, quite seamlessly. Yeah, that's

S Speaker 313:12a great point. I mean, that's an area where Japanese government focus areas are driving not our direct activity, but certainly influencing our activity. We do sit on many innovation committee for semiconductor, so we have several direct AI, Japanese focused direct AI investments as well. So this is a space that's evolving very quickly for US based, again, primarily on market demands. Japan is less than 3% of the Well, I'm sure you know all this, but less than 3% of the world semiconductor production at the moment. And that's not they're quite determined to turn that around. And you know, of course, the first step is always massive. CO invest with TSMC, with micron, with Samsung, is putting a huge facility in down south, which I wouldn't say. These are easy, obviously, but they don't require enormous amount of local R and D, you know, interesting stuff. But they are now led by many, but also the finance ministry putting a ton of money into more IP Intensive R and D, bringing University projects out, and so that we play a pretty pivotal role in that, and are looking to play a bigger role. So that's another, again, another we really Japan focused at the end of the day.
a great point. I mean, that's an area where Japanese government focus areas are driving not our direct activity, but certainly influencing our activity. We do sit on many innovation committee for semiconductor, so we have several direct AI, Japanese focused direct AI investments as well.

Japan is less than 3% of the Well, I'm sure you know all this, but less than 3% of the world semiconductor production at the moment. And that's not they're quite determined to turn that around. And you know, of course, the first step is always massive. CO invest with TSMC, with micron, with Samsung, is putting a huge facility in down south, which I wouldn't say. These are easy, obviously, but they don't require enormous amount of local R and D, you know, interesting stuff. But they are now led by many, but also the finance ministry putting a ton of money into more IP Intensive R and D, bringing University projects out, and so that we play a pretty pivotal role in that, and are looking to play a bigger role. So that's another, again, another we really Japan focused at the end of the day.
a great point. I mean, that's an area where Japanese government focus areas are driving not our direct activity, but certainly influencing our activity.

S Speaker 114:40That makes sense. And in terms of AI, are you particularly looking at the infrastructure stack? Do you plan to be investing more downstream application, storing layer as well?

S Speaker 315:02our first areas of interest, given Japan's industrial focus, we have a very strong interest in physical what we call physical AI, basically, models that are derived from physical devices, whether it's mobility or factory automation. This is a space that's, you know, quite interesting and important to us, and we've made a couple of early investments there. We are interested in Japanese language, Japanese language used expansively to include emotional content, to include broad but Japanese language based models are a place that we're spending a fair amount of time. We've invested in this is a very immature sector in Japan, but we think we have invested in one of the two leading companies in the space. There are less than 30 PhDs in generative AI in Japan. It's quite spare. We have been starting a pretty intensive program. We invested in light matter. We were one of the early investors almost, well more than three years ago. Now, I'm on the board. We led their C round as well, you know. So they that was on an early AI thesis, although that wasn't a thing, but that is what that is, what drove the investment we've since invested in in charge, which is doing some work that's very close, obviously, to what Qualcomm is doing. On the distributed and edge side, we promised ourselves that we would never touch Quantum. But of course, you know, sometimes you bend your rules. So we are in the process of looking at a very interesting infrastructure play there that will involve GPUs and CPUs as well as qubits, in a very particular way, with some very large government work on its side. So, you know, the we're continuing to look at some at AI infrastructure in the broadest sense we've been, you know, spending a lot of time looking at cooling without a result. We've been we're perhaps that the area that we will spend the most time on in the next six to nine months is basically behind the meter energy in this space where we're particularly so when we think of infrastructure, I'm sorry to go so long. When we think of infrastructure, we think of quite a broad, comprehensive view of what's going to be required to continue to keep up with the demand that for the next five years seems to be partially endless.

S Speaker 318:38Well, again, it's a we spend a lot of time thinking about adoption. You know, technology is important, and obviously and people are important, but also adoption is quite fundamental, you know, to being a financially driven investor. So, you know, the grid itself with the utilities, which we're quite familiar with, is inherently slow. The it's not that they are not competent. They're typically quite smart people, but their economic incentives are quite negative for innovation. Yeah, you know the story, I mean. So when we talk about behind the meter, we're thinking more of high value customers who are willing and able in the regulatory environments changing quite quickly to allow, for instance, Microsoft to invest in geothermal or nuclear, potentially without touching ratepayers. So this is long we've invested in, for instance, a long duration energy storage company that we're extremely bullish on. It's not in there's nothing in the technology that says they will connect to the grid or not, but the first customers are faster and more easy to to or, frankly, willing to pay that are primarily not connected to the grid. So whether it's a steel mill or the first customers are a very large tank farm posted on the ship channel, literally selling energy into the now, they will connect to the grid to some extent, but it's not through the utilities. It's through a through a rate sharing plan. So this is the kind we're looking at. You know, where is the fastest adoption? For instance, in that long duration energy storage market, it looks like the demand will outstrip the supply for the next 10 years, so trying to find them the maximum value for those particular projects. And also, you know, frankly, there's bankability and so, you know, it's utilities are exceptionally conservative when it comes to financing these things. So running your own systems and selling electrons is often a faster route to market. So it's in that context
Well, again, it's a we spend a lot of time thinking about adoption.

S Speaker 322:02yeah, I think you're on the right, you know, exactly the right place we we're look we're a modest size US firm or a larger Asian firm. But, you know, we have certain limitations, and so we need to be as focused as both, but all of these, we think, are exceptionally interesting over the next five to seven years. Look, the grid has to be dramatically better. Yeah, it's now. What's going to be the driver behind that? Hard to say, but it will take regulatory change, right? You know, to some extent, because as long as it's primarily cost, plus, there's just no major incentive. I mean, gas plants are really easy to build and super efficient, as long as you know, where are the big data centers going, you know, other than the most visible ones, Wyoming and Nebraska, because there's gas. Yeah. You know, that's kind of depressing, but that's the reality at the moment. And you know, of course, better than all of us, that if you've got 40 megawatts of power to your data center, you're going to use 40 watts a mega, you know, megawatts of power. You're just going to get as many cycles as you can to sell. Nobody's going to use less energy,

S Speaker 123:21right? Right? Jeff, I totally agree with what you're saying. We have some partners focusing on quantum so that has been an area that we have looked more deeply in the past. We didn't make an investment. We have an Israel based investment, but not anything very strategic in there. We have a person also focusing on data center infrastructure. So optical cables is an area we are looking at. Cooling in data centers is also an area look we are looking at. Those aren't the areas I personally look at, but if there are synergies, I'm happy to connect you to someone in the team. No,

S Speaker 124:00point. So personally, I'm leading our efforts in AI application investments right now. So those could be physical AI or just software AI applications. And I'm looking at our electric trying to expand our electrification focus. So we have been opportunistic there. We're trying to be more strategic, trying to see score, scope the market right now, we plan to make a few bets over the next year. So those are the couple of areas I'm leading. Interesting.
