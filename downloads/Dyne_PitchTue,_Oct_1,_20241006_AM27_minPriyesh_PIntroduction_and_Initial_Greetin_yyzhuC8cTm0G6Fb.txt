S Speaker 10:54Well, I can start by giving my introduction and a bit about the fund and how we operate, and then I'll pass it over to you then absolutely. So I currently work at Qualcomm ventures as a senior associate. I joined the team about eight months back, so I'm one of the newest members here and the team itself. We are 10 people in the US investment team, eight of us based out of the Bay Area, a couple of us in still in San Diego, where the Qualcomm headquarters is broadly our investment mandates span from AI, the entire infrastructure and application stack, enterprise, SaaS, IoT, robotic, industrial automation, things Around AR, VR and like, the mandate is quite broad, and if you see there is an angle of compute or connectivity to the solution, that is something that gets us excited. Our check sizes are two to 10 million so we preferably like to get in around series A but at times more recently, we have started doing some seed deals as well, especially in AI, given the valuations have just blown up, and we are a global fund. So the team, we have offices in us, Latin America, in Brazil, in Israel, China and India. And I would say we have a strong mandate, at least in the US team. And we would like we in us, which means that the entire, I'd say, Canada region, is also something that comes under our purview. We aim to deploy somewhere around 150 to $200 million a year. Okay, that's good. And

is there any specific number of investments you guys look into, or like agnostic? And
S Speaker 12:46it does, because we are stage agnostic, the number of investments shift quite a lot. Sometimes we have done Series C, series D deals as well. So the number of investments change, the mandate, or the amount of total investment is somewhere between 150, 200 that's what we aim to deploy. Yeah, okay, no,

S Speaker 23:45I just wanted to make a friend as well. Like, it would be good to get to know someone in the industry, and Qualcomm specifically, is close to me because my younger brother interned at Qualcomm this summer. He's in Georgia Tech and that time, and Qualcomm is his favorite company, so most likely graduate next year and work as well. He has a full time offer. He's on the computer science side. He's not on the entrepreneur side or venture side, so it's okay, nevertheless, you know, would love to give you a bit of background on myself, and so where do I start? So my journey, personally, begins as a serial entrepreneur since I was 17 years old. So back to 2017, when I was 17, I had my first exit back in India to Tata. If you heard of Tata, you know their own land group, to airline, software companies, everything, absolutely. So I obviously know it's my biggest success and biggest regret, biggest success. Because you know, when you're 17 and you meet Rattata in person, yeah, you're

S Speaker 118:29it arnov And a few follow up questions there. This is exciting on the first year. So the value proposition there is to grow the top line. These are smaller shops, and you have figured out a way to use generative AI, in a sense, to automate and scale some of these ad outcomes. Is that the broader value proposition, how do you go about acquiring them?

S Speaker 222:00that's one of the propositions. It's a subset. The main value proposition is operational efficiency. When we talk about this, the main ROI which restaurants want to see is, did my revenue grow? Did my menu retention grow? Did my returning customers grow? And did I save someone? These are the metrics typically a customer asks us, and of course, if we can do it by aggregating data points and giving them recommendations, sure, but we have to also actually streamline every decision making component in their system, so we plug in with every potential system. And today, dine has partnered up with 40 plus restaurant tech companies. So when you ask me about the competitive landscape, I can send over a report as well. We, rather than you know through my concept of business was simple, which is about people and partnerships. So you meet the right people, you build the partnerships. So rather than fighting for the same market, you essentially grow the pie and become partners with all of these. So dine has today partnered up with these 40 plus restaurant tech companies, allowing us to essentially go into market with Open Table, square touch piece to and all, and rather become add on as a service to ensure that the operators or the owners of these restaurants are benefiting from so the second year value proposition is operational efficiency.

S Speaker 226:30So traditionally, I do have another meeting, so I might have to do a follow up call with you tomorrow if you're down Absolutely. Initially, we have four sections of analytics, marketing analytics, pricing analytics, operational automation, which means staffing inventory. And all comes together inside that we have analytics on footfall as well as demand forecasting on terms of what's coming in. The last one is competitive analytics on what every other restaurant Cafe around you is doing and what you should be doing different or safe to maybe do better around so four different sets of analytics. Sounds
