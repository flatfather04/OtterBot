S Speaker 21:54Closed, closed three. Oh, congrats. Circa the D and Golden Gate have closed, and we will be onboarding them next week. We are working, hence why I'm not taking time off. We're working to onboard them now. We're very excited about them. And then we have one more major one that we're working towards to close I'm hopeful by by before the end of the year, and then we've got an, well, two, actually, I should say two. We've got Caesars, and then we've got Grand Sierra Resort and and the Sahara hotel that we're looking to, that we're looking to move those

S Speaker 22:36Thank you. Yeah, we had a really good call with their ownership group, with the Grand Sierra Resort and the the Grand Sierra Resort and the Sahara last week. So that was a really positive call. And then I spoke with the Caesars executive team yesterday, and I learned that their COO, their newly appointed COO, was asked during their executive committee Town Hall last week that What are you doing when they were asked, What are you doing with AI? How are we as a company embracing this? And he says, we're partnering with this new company traversing AI, and we couldn't be more excited. So if that doesn't tell people that we're here then that I don't

S Speaker 34:19used to have a nightmare commute to San Mateo from so I live in the East Bay, and so it was the CTO of Koopa, and I was, I was the product guy, so we would go all the way from Oakland to San Mateo every day. But this was the original Koopa offices, where, if the wind blew right, it would turn out the pilot light in the heat, and so we would have to, like, relight that when it was on the roof. But, yeah, that was early, early days of Cooper talking about that. That could be it the other day. Do not recommend. I can imagine.

S Speaker 15:01Well, Blake, pleasure meeting you both again today. I think would be great to just go through the product demo, and then would love to understand the tech stack that's behind that as well. And then, from your perspective, where do you see differentiation being built up?

S Speaker 26:56well? There is, and I'll show you that as well. Once we get further into it, I'm going to show you the phone connections first, yeah, and then we'll show you the options once we're live on the back end, and then what that looks like, and how it translates into the chat model, where it can go with the MCP version, and then how it can ingrain itself into things like reputation management across Google, TripAdvisor, Expedia, booking and so forth. Got it so, yes, let

S Speaker 17:42Pretty Pretty interesting, right? And how do you onboard customers? I'm sorry, I'm just jumping into questions because so how do you onboard customers, and what kind of data do you need to ingest to sort of just go across all of these rooms, and what's the onboarding time as well?

S Speaker 213:11Yeah, let me show you this as a sample set of what we're talking about. This is how we talk about it, with the property again, keeping it in the same frame of reference for Sahara and Grand Sierra Resort. So you can see, from our standpoint, we are that unified layer for conversational voice AI, the omni channel messaging like we're talking about the real time sentiment and intent. And then the MCP piece as well, which we can talk through for the Rio, because that is, in fact, live, but ancillaries and upsells. So how are we connected to increase or upsell the customer when it comes to things like late checkout, early check in, doing things like an upgrade. So if the customer is already booked in a in this scenario, in Alexandria room, but we want to upgrade them to a suite in the Alexandria tower. How do we identify these areas of opportunity and then do that without the involvement of a human? And so that's what the connection there is, pool and spot. Sorry, I'll pause. I see you. I think you may have

S Speaker 214:25These are all property dependent, so not, not every property is the same. So we can tap into any of them. And that really becomes our moat. Is because we've been around for so many years of sweetness, we have this ability to create the API's and access the rates so quickly and allow us to go in and identify the opportunity to push that information into the reservation queue, because we're already doing that today with our current reservation process and that particular scenario. And then the other ways we're involved or integrated are through these other systems that we just have long skinning relationships with. Most of these are owned by the same groups or very alike or adjacent groups. And so we've been building this for years. We're just now putting it into play as traversing.

S Speaker 215:34Yeah, I think when we talk about competitors, you know, we look at a lot of what from a voice perspective. We look at folks like poly AI and Amelia or sound hound, depending on how you look at them. So we've heard them come through in the market, specifically here in Vegas. But frankly, they're not they're not hospitality specific. They don't go as deep, and they don't solve the entire customer journey. So Sahara just to continue on the same conversation, they ripped out Paul AI because their guest service points dropped 15% they can't have that. And again, it's just because it can't function. It falls into the same loop, or the customer customer relationship issue, whereas at the Rio, we've been live for seven, eight months, and their service scores have improved, a property that doesn't have the same service levels as a Sahara is actually performing better across Google, across Expedia, than the Sahara. Right? Then it's competing with a Caesar's Palace, right from a service level perspective, so, and that is because we're able to adapt and respond to customers like they would want to real time, very

So Sahara just to continue on the same conversation, they ripped out Paul AI because their guest service points dropped 15% they can't have that. And again, it's just because it can't function. It falls into the same loop, or the customer customer relationship issue, whereas at the Rio, we've been live for seven, eight months, and their service scores have improved, a property that doesn't have the same service levels as a Sahara is actually performing better across Google, across Expedia, than the Sahara. Right? Then it's competing with a Caesar's Palace, right from a service level perspective, so, and that is because we're able to adapt and respond to customers like they would want to real time, very
S Speaker 116:52quickly and sound out. I imagine Blair is not vertical for hospitality. Is poly a more vertical solution for hospitality? Do you come do you come across any specific vertical companies that act as the direct as direct competitors today,

S Speaker 217:08just traversing AI. So traversing AI is the hospitality, hospitality vertical deployed model, and that is the what we're looking to continue to own in on, hone in on as we look outside. Other competitors that we would look at would be Google. Google has their their their engine as well, but now we look at them as a partner, right? So we are a partner with Google and pioneering that so that hotels don't have to go in as deep and go into all the integrations. They don't have to hire consultants to come in on top of engineers to come in and piecemeal all the integrations together. They already have a solution, but they can just say, Oh, we've partnered to Google to power our AI platform. That's great. We are their AI platform. That's where that becomes a big win for us.

S Speaker 117:56Got it. Got it. And Blair, how's the GTF looking like? Is it fair for me to assume that, since you both have very deep, say, relationships in this industry, most of the connections today are most of the clients today are coming from your past connections. Or do you have, say, a GTM motion built in? Do you have sales team? How? How does the next year look like?

S Speaker 218:19That's the goal of the raise is to put is to build out at least one more person in the sales team. It is just me right now, but really to add more, one more person into the sales ecosystem. So from a GTM perspective, we're really heavy on focusing on the group of hotels that are 1000 rooms or more, because these are the ones that are building out the use cases for us we have, we have 3000 calls a day that we can process, that we can learn from, and that we can continue to make the transition for each properties that much smoother. And so when we start to think about what is the next phase. There's only about 200 to 250 of those hotels. There's a very small niche group of those once we move into the next phase, that's your chains. Now, there's chains that have 100 1000 rooms, there's chains that have six or, sorry, 1000 hotels. There's chains that have 6000 hotels, but they all have somewhere between 50 to 600 rooms. They're not major resorts, and as a result of that, we already have the right integrations. Because of our enterprise agreements, we already have had the scenarios. Now it's just piecemeal. It to make them feel special. They have the right brand, they have the right tone and voice. Then we move into our next phase of GTM, which is really about, how do we think through those smaller properties the SMBs to and then a self onboarding phase, right where we can identify ways that they can come in and utilize these services through our partnerships, but they don't have to have the same level of involvement. And then during all of that time, as we've activated in these channels we're working with from an account management strategy to further sell them on other tools and services. Because we're not just voice. We have so many other components of the user journey that we can take over. And as we do that, we want to take over what you're considering, the booking engineer, from a hoteliers perspective, we want to take over things like outbound marketing and taking over more and more of their pieces of the pie. And that's where an account management team comes in play.

S Speaker 120:31Very interesting. I like what I see. I can you sort of also send me say a number for for a live deal, I do plan to be in Vegas soon for CES. I'd love to try the product myself, sort of go through the entire funnel, and then make a reservation eventually. So I'll try using that as well. And then would love to go through the sales or the sales tech that you had would read up on that front on my end. And then, Blair, can you remind me again, what was the round size and what would be the error by the end of this year? Yeah. Kyle, do you want to hit

on maybe what we're thinking through from a round perspective?
on maybe what we're thinking through from a round perspective?
S Speaker 421:20Yeah. Yeah. I mean, so it's obviously timing. We're thinking, you know, q1,
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, so it's obviously timing. We're thinking, you know, q1,
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, so it's obviously timing. We're thinking, you know, q1,
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, so it's obviously timing. We're thinking, you know, q1,
S Speaker 321:27being one where. So the round size we're looking at is just based on the milestones. So it's the closing, these few partnerships that we have, you know, fully in, like, you know, we're just contract negotiating at this point. And so the we think that the round was land somewhere, probably between 10 and 15, yeah. And then, so, yeah, that's where we're looking at. Then the err is very like, the realized, Arr, just because some lot of these ones won't be implementing until q1 versus the contracted Arr, but the contracts, because these hotels are, like, especially the Venetian, have such a long process that it's like, their contracts are pretty ironclad when it comes to the revenue side. But, yeah, I think there's a pretty big Delta.
being one where. So the round size we're looking at is just based on the milestones.

S Speaker 122:20Let's just go with the contracted AR figure Kyle that that should work. Yeah.
Let's just go with the contracted AR figure Kyle that that should work. Yeah.
Let's just go with the contracted AR figure Kyle that that should work. Yeah.
Let's just go with the contracted AR figure Kyle that that should work. Yeah.
S Speaker 222:26Contracted AR by the end of this year will be a little over 3 million and that's without, that is without the new stuff that we have. That's just with the stuff today with, if we talk about the stuff that's still in the pipeline, seizures, entertainment we talked about, which, again, I do expect to close by the end of the year, but I'm not. I'm not, I don't count my chickens before they Yeah, right. But Caesars Entertainment is still in the pipeline, as is a Grand Sierra Resort and the Sahara. So those would take us over to about five and a half million and then, if we then Venetian will be a q1 close, and then that brings us a 7 million in close,
Contracted AR by the end of this year will be a little over 3 million and that's without, that is without the new stuff that we have.

Just wanted to keep you posted that there is some work internally at Qualcomm business units that we want to go to market across different verticals with some AI solutions that work on our platforms. So that way, I know there is a few business units that are working on that, and I'll keep you posted on that as well. That could be a very interesting engagement that we can do meanwhile, while the lounge is developing. But I'd love to go through the materials, come back to you with some questions, and we can do that async. Would love to hear our thoughts on those and and we can take it from there.
