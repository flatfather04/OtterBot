0:18where are you based?
S Speaker 20:19New York. So just just in our home in New York today, but our office is in in Brooklyn, so on the river. How about you in the bay?

S Speaker 10:39what you're building from Priyesh. And what we can do is I can do quick introductions. My My background is engineering product at Qualcomm. Then over the last eight years, I've been investing with quantum ventures.

1:08And a large part of
S Speaker 11:10my investments has been in AI. And then so we've invested in companies like hugging face bits and biases and scale and tropic and a few others, and a large part of our investments were in AI infrastructure, AI tooling before, but now we're doing more AI applications and for Qualcomm. So you know, strategic investment are for Qualcomm. So we invest in areas that are, broadly speaking, relevant to Qualcomm. And so in in terms of so for, from a product standpoint, Qualcomm has a large portion of our businesses and smartphones, a lot, and then the other proportions of our business are in auto networking, AI PCs, AI cloud, inferencing chips, and xr ships, wearables, a whole bunch of other platforms. So we ship over close to 2 billion chips every year now and and it's not just chips, chips, including software and everything. So for AI, we're putting AI compute in every single one of these platforms. And so the belief is that every device, from small to cloud, will have aI compute, which is today, as we're talking this is not surprising at all, but we started putting this AI compute in our hardware about 10 years ago, and so, so the idea for from an investment thesis standpoint, for us, is to work with startups that are that are pushing the boundaries of compute and connectivity, and then they can potentially remove some of the compute in not necessarily today, but we think that there will be a world where there'll be hybrid compute down the road, and then, so that's that's the lens that with which we look at startups. And then it means different for mobile, means different from for AI PCs, it being so like, for example, with a lot of AI startups we're working with, we think that the future of AI

S Speaker 13:42many startups to take them to enterprise customers

S Speaker 13:48on on a PC side, and then so that there's been a lot of good traction with startups, and then they've been able to find a lot of enterprise customers through that channel as well. So that's an example. But then, similarly, we do it for a lot of other spaces. And so we deploy one, $50 million every year. So
on on a PC side, and then so that there's been a lot of good traction with startups, and then they've been able to find a lot of enterprise customers through that channel as well.

4:09and then, typically,
S Speaker 14:10our check size tend to be, so what stage? Our check size tends to be five to 10 initial check size. We can do smaller for earlier stage. But that's, that's our speed spot.

S Speaker 24:23Yeah, no, that makes sense. I mean, Priyesh has probably told you in the prep where this is our first investment round, so it's early stage, but on the but on the basis we've, you know, we've been bootstrapping for for the last year. I had a previous exit from our consultancy business, which I touch on when I introduced what we've been up to, but kind of got us to the point of MVP just to think about the process. And then some early customer traction. Yeah. And then, and then we're moving. That's why we're doing this first round.
Yeah, no, that makes sense.

S Speaker 14:56Sounds good. Yeah. Let me know if you have any questions, we we can discuss more about the winter. mentors my background.

S Speaker 111:14Few questions, which is, if you go back to that chart, so which is so right now? So what part of the company correct me, if I'm wrong with that is, like

11:29and and then the other part
and and then the other part
and and then the other part
and and then the other part
S Speaker 111:31of the company is website, chat bots, and then the other so would do you want to create a beach head? Like, do you want to go and say, Okay, I'm what I want to be, the docs and of AI world,
of the company is website, chat bots, and then the other so would do you want to create a beach head? Like, do you want to go and say, Okay, I'm what I want to be, the docs and of AI world,

S Speaker 111:55because of your go to market, sales for each one of these is, is going to be different,
because of your go to market, sales for each one of these is, is going to be different,
because of your go to market, sales for each one of these is, is going to be different,
because of your go to market, sales for each one of these is, is going to be different,
S Speaker 212:00no. So, just to be clear, yeah. So we want to like customers,
no. So, just to be clear, yeah. So we want to like customers,
no. So, just to be clear, yeah. So we want to like customers,
no. So, just to be clear, yeah. So we want to like customers,
S Speaker 112:04like, if I want to discover, you know, like Doc send work, because the name says doc send. So if I want to send documents over, that's where I go
like, if I want to discover, you know, like Doc send work, because the name says doc send. So if I want to send documents over, that's where I go
like, if I want to discover, you know, like Doc send work, because the name says doc send. So if I want to send documents over, that's where I go
like, if I want to discover, you know, like Doc send work, because the name says doc send. So if I want to send documents over, that's where I go
12:16as a customer. It's easy for me to find that, right,
as a customer. It's easy for me to find that, right,
as a customer. It's easy for me to find that, right,
as a customer. It's easy for me to find that, right,
S Speaker 112:20but, but now, if your go to market and messaging is, I'm also our website chat bot, and I'm also a doc send and I'm also something else. Then Doesn't it come hard?
but, but now, if your go to market and messaging is, I'm also our website chat bot, and I'm also a doc send and I'm also something else. Then Doesn't it come hard?
but, but now, if your go to market and messaging is, I'm also our website chat bot, and I'm also a doc send and I'm also something else. Then Doesn't it come hard?
but, but now, if your go to market and messaging is, I'm also our website chat bot, and I'm also a doc send and I'm also something else. Then Doesn't it come hard?
S Speaker 212:31No, because we so we want to be like the AI of Doc send for enterprise, right? And Dropbox, whatever you want to call it, we think there's a massive opportunity, because no one is sharing information in the tone of voice, and they're not learning from the insights of something like a dot send or Dropbox that's obvious to the traction that we've got. We do not care the format of where that's presented. So at the moment, when you're creating one of those knowledge loops on our website, on our platform, does not matter. If you send to website as GitHub code, you send to a client by a HubSpot automated email, or you hide it behind your investment portal. Actually, the strength of what we're building is it doesn't matter where that manifests itself. The principle is that is the same. So from it's a technology

S Speaker 113:15view, right? Like Technically, yes, it's an LLM, and and then that LLM can manifest itself. It's retrieving information and then sending that information in lots of different forms, but that's every company that's building an AI today. I'm talking more from a distribution standpoint. Does. How do customers discover you? How do you go to market? How you build a repeatable sales motion? How do you build because selling to a website is different from selling to private equities and startups that want to send documents over, right?

S Speaker 213:52Yeah. So for us, it's a classic hub and hub and spoke model. So for example, it doesn't matter that it's a website widget or or it's personal data rooms, but what we're doing, for example, is we secured LIVESTRONG. We've then got, we've taken someone that's been in UNICEF for six years in the digital team, and then now going out to our next 100 nonprofits. So it's subject expert sales right now to get to the first kind of data mode of nonprofit. And we're doing the same for private equity and VCs. So at the moment, I'm doing that myself, or we're going through our working with partners, but the idea is, then we do a subject expert sell into very specific markets, then it flips to product led growth after we've got kind of the first 100 enterprises within each industry vertical. For example, four nonprofits have clicked white label in livestrong's website and have now come through asking how we look at their knowledge management. So right now, subject to expert growth, then flipping to product led growth through the interactions of people using these forms, the documents, whether that's websites, emails, data rooms, it's just purely that network effect of sharing that information.

S Speaker 215:17So the all of the fonts, emails and tones, were just effectively scraping via via website, and as soon as they've uploaded one or two documents, that's enough that it starts to personalize the system prompt. So do they use abbreviations? Do they write with empathy, or is it direct finances? And that's where we're going to build a mode of personalization of prompt and lmm use that you would never get with with with chat, GPT, or, or, or something like heavy or a glean, right? Because heavier glean are very focused on internal practices as a rank based application, where we're really leaning into the personalization and and the external interactions of how you're using this. If that makes sense. Got

And that's where we're going to build a mode of personalization of prompt and lmm use that you would never get with with with chat, GPT, or, or, or something like heavy or a glean, right? Because heavier glean are very focused on internal practices as a rank based application, where we're really leaning into the personalization and and the external interactions of how you're using this. If that makes sense. Got
S Speaker 116:06it, I think, and so.
16:11And then you were talking about third
And then you were talking about third

16:16go to market as well in your chart, right which, what
go to market as well in your chart, right which, what

go to market as well in your chart, right which, what
S Speaker 216:18was that? Yeah, look, we're at the stage right now where we're we're obviously testing to define what's the low hanging fruit in the right industries. So one of my questions back to you would be, how, in that early stage we look at some of the enterprises that you have, we'll see where the really clear use cases are, and then that's how we're focusing on scaling markets. Really simple for us. At the moment, we're looking at fundraising. It could be private equity, VC or nonprofit. We've already secured an interesting pilot in logistics and supply chain, three of them. So there's an obvious move into looking at logistics and corporate communications, so management consultants working with big enterprises or organizations, sharing public companies, sharing with their investors, or what that might be that's naturally the first three industries that we've started to get traction on. But, but the imagination could be open to legal, sharing, ma deals, to whatever makes sense. The important thing is to not try and hit all markets at once real deep application level, and then build out as as we start to bridge with subject level experts and partners the departments.

S Speaker 117:26And then you mentioned so with these private equities on that the first product, do you have private equities that are already using this? Yeah,
And then you mentioned so with these private equities on that the first product, do you have private equities that are already using this? Yeah,

S Speaker 217:39correct. So we're working we're in beta with with around 10 to 15 customers. At the moment, at different stages, we've got revenue traction, where we do some paid pilots and then move on to ARR models. I think the important thing as well is with the heavier and the gleams of the world have been chasing, kind of the six, seven figure contracts big companies. And I think that what that's done is left in an underserved market, smaller teams that can't hire an investor relations person, or can't have that extra associate, 10 to 20 person, teams that can really speed up through this kind of personal dot send, as you put it, kind of market that's where our entry point is. And
correct. So we're working we're in beta with with around 10 to 15 customers.

And
18:28you're looking to raise how much.
you're looking to raise how much.
you're looking to raise how much.
you're looking to raise how much.
S Speaker 218:29So we're looking to do around 2 million in this first round that that could be flexed, depending on on the lead investor. We've got a million committed, one half a million from A, B to B, A i fund is New York, and around half a million of strategic investment angels and small funds around it. So we're looking to close at the end of the end of the month, and now we're seeing what that looks like with a lead investor, or we're talking to a couple of smaller co investment
So we're looking to do around 2 million in this first round that that could be flexed, depending on on the lead investor.

S Speaker 119:01funds. The interception route for us would be more your next round, given our check size. But I think the other thing is, what I would say is, as you probably know, there's, there's many companies going after public management. The question becomes, what's your beach head?
funds. The interception route for us would be more your next round, given our check size. But I think the other thing is, what I would say is, as you probably know, there's, there's many companies going after public management. The question becomes, what's your beach head?

S Speaker 119:34knowledge management and knowledge retrieval really, really well, yeah. And then it's only getting better. And then the playing field, from a tech standpoint, is leveling for everybody, yeah, it's the same techniques rag on your personal data, and then you use a large element for base model, yeah. And so the question is, how do you create
knowledge management and knowledge retrieval really, really well, yeah. And then it's only getting better.

S Speaker 120:31And that's a question that I've asked from the data room. No, having said that, my guess is Dropbox and Box. I haven't used box as data room in a while, but I don't know if they're going after this as well, because that guy, Karen Levy, keeps talking about AI a lot, yeah? So I would be surprised that they're going after that as well. But having said that,

S Speaker 220:59yeah, it's also building on kind of legacy and comprehensive. The old software is not official purpose. Yeah, so much. I think, I think you're right on the repeatable sales motion. I think that's what we're starting to gear ourselves up for by going after very specific enterprise workflows. But,
