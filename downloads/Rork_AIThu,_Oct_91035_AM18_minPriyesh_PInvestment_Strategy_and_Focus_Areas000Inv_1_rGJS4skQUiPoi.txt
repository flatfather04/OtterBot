S Speaker 10:00Investments every year in areas that are strategically relevant to Qualcomm. Now what we Qualcomm has large business and platforms that go into mobile phones, platforms that go into PCs, platforms that go into XR devices, wearables on Cloud, internships and automotive and IoT and everything for the purpose of this call, I think what's the most important part would be

S Speaker 10:35which is we always work with companies that are building apps on which essentially uses the inference capabilities also on these mobile processors. We believe that a lot of the compute, lot of the inference, will also move to mobile devices and also move to the computer devices, just because of the cost, privacy, security, latency, all those reasons and and this is where I think

1:05what you're building would be interesting,
what you're building would be interesting,
what you're building would be interesting,
what you're building would be interesting,
S Speaker 11:09and hence we're spending some time in this space. Yeah, happy to answer more questions. I mean, it's, it's We do everything from seed through late stage. Our sweet spot tends to be a and b and c,

S Speaker 21:31Yeah. Nice, nice, yeah. What does your process look like
Yeah. Nice, nice, yeah. What does your process look like
Yeah. Nice, nice, yeah. What does your process look like
Yeah. Nice, nice, yeah. What does your process look like
1:37for an investment,
1:40our process, I mean, we
our process, I mean, we
our process, I mean, we
our process, I mean, we
S Speaker 11:44we essentially, what we want to make sure is we both companies benefit from this partnership. So we do want to see a little more work on how the two companies can work together, so with our mobile businesses and with our PC businesses, and then after that, really, I would say, from an investment perspective, it's a four to five week process

2:11to get to a decision
S Speaker 12:14I understand. And for your current round, my guess is you're looking for a week long decision process. Yeah, week. Process. Yeah, we if that's the case, then unfortunately, we won't be able to participate in the current round, but at the same time, we can always work with each other and then, and in some cases, your next round comes faster than you think. Yeah, but, but that's the background. And then, so have you raised seed already? Or it
I understand. And for your current round, my guess is you're looking for a week long decision process. Yeah, week. Process.

S Speaker 23:09Yeah, I started 17 years old in mobile apps. First studied physics in the best physics university in the country, won some National Math and Physics Olympiads. And then

3:27this was where in Moscow.
this was where in Moscow.
this was where in Moscow.
this was where in Moscow.
S Speaker 23:32And then my stuff is Indian, so I went there a lot of times the message to live in London. So I lived there for two years, basically, some kind of, like international from early days, and then

3:48from that, I just basically
from that, I just basically
from that, I just basically
from that, I just basically
S Speaker 23:54to be an entrepreneur and just don't have to work and just only work in something that is interesting. So build my first app that was like Searched Movies by my app, kind of app which were solving a problem, and just like finding what to watch by mood, we used our own embedded model that we called Movie DNA, and then early elements like Bert to basically predict what with emotions, what you get from movie, like inspired, thought provoking, disgusted arousal, or like romantic feelings, or any kind of like those things that we ranked all the movies and shows in the world to that linked people to other streaming services, Not only Netflix, and then build the best like recommendation system, basically that predicts what movie you would watch next for all of us. And this app grew to number two App Store in three countries, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and basically, yeah, pretty much, it was my first company was based out of Moscow, so I think the market was not great, but we still raised money, and then it was like, Great first company for me. Then I just moved out to crypto because it was covid, and I built the first generative art marketplace for art on Ethereum and work with the soft space artist got similar to logic and art collection generative. Ai, then we just started doing only code generated art effect, JS, three js and more. We kind of went to the first version of cloud artifacts there, and then, kind of from that, I went back to consumer AI built the first bi voice planning app singing one of the first and which grew viral on Tik Tok. And it was three months before suno launched. So we kind of like preempted that way. But then we were the early users of ourselves, base and some 3.5 and then basically, at the moment happened, we understood that non technical people people are spending too much time. First, they're starting building web apps and mobile app from targets, and just like accepting code changes without really understanding what I did, which now is called by coding, there was, like three multiple launched. So that's, that's where we are. And then we started building for web, cloud, mobile web, but we decided our, actually, our leverage is to just build on mobile because that's the harder problem. And actually, on top opportunity, the huge market of billion devices, I'm sure you know, there was, but no real way of building mobile apps, especially from your phone, but also we support both. And my co founder has a crazier story. He basically built his first mobile app at 17 years old. You could do 2 million users to reduce by every third kid in Moscow, and here six figures from revenue from that, basically, the app became so powerful and big on the kids minds, basically, that Russian government tried to block it, and then he fought with them in a media world to unblock it.

7:15Basically, yeah, and then basically,
Basically, yeah, and then basically,
Basically, yeah, and then basically,
Basically, yeah, and then basically,
S Speaker 27:19he became a deep expert in React Native during those seven years when they finally, when the war started, they finally killed the app. He just went all in South America, and just when chatgpt came out, he was like, I'm gonna build agents, because that's the future. The first day for QA first stage for TA, first navigating complex enterprise products and then lots of other small projects. Then we met in San Francisco three years ago and start building these apps together some of the as I mentioned, and now we're building work. Okay,
he became a deep expert in React Native during those seven years when they finally, when the war started, they finally killed the app. He just went all in South America, and just when chatgpt came out, he was like, I'm gonna build agents, because that's the future.

S Speaker 17:59that's that's a very interesting journey for both of you.
that's that's a very interesting journey for both of you.
that's that's a very interesting journey for both of you.
that's that's a very interesting journey for both of you.
S Speaker 28:05And we also went all in and maxed our credit cards and slept on mattress. That was true for immigrants. We just came in the country and just very convinced that something like rock should work either for web, obviously, was more allowable.
And we also went all in and maxed our credit cards and slept on mattress. That was true for immigrants. We just came in the country and just very convinced that something like rock should work either for web, obviously, was more allowable.

S Speaker 18:25And Daniel the I know we're what, how much time do you have?
And Daniel the I know we're what, how much time do you have?
And Daniel the I know we're what, how much time do you have?
And Daniel the I know we're what, how much time do you have?
8:31I have, like, five more minutes.
I have, like, five more minutes.
I have, like, five more minutes.
I have, like, five more minutes.
S Speaker 18:34Okay, so the biggest question that we have, Danielle is, how do like
Okay, so the biggest question that we have, Danielle is, how do like
Okay, so the biggest question that we have, Danielle is, how do like
Okay, so the biggest question that we have, Danielle is, how do like
8:42now, in this world of wide coding,
now, in this world of wide coding,
now, in this world of wide coding,
now, in this world of wide coding,
S Speaker 18:47is it really different, if you focus on building mobile apps? Can't lovable do that, can't cloud code do that is and now, right now, can, can't cursor do that? And then, so, that's the big question. And then, so,
is it really different, if you focus on building mobile apps? Can't lovable do that, can't cloud code do that is and now, right now, can, can't cursor do that? And then, so, that's the big question. And then, so,
is it really different, if you focus on building mobile apps? Can't lovable do that, can't cloud code do that is and now, right now, can, can't cursor do that? And then, so, that's the big question. And then, so,
is it really different, if you focus on building mobile apps? Can't lovable do that, can't cloud code do that is and now, right now, can, can't cursor do that? And then, so, that's the big question. And then, so,
S Speaker 29:03because mobile apps is huge on in practice, it's a huge infrastructure problem. Like, have you tried developing mobile apps? Then just, I was
because mobile apps is huge on in practice, it's a huge infrastructure problem. Like, have you tried developing mobile apps? Then just, I was
because mobile apps is huge on in practice, it's a huge infrastructure problem. Like, have you tried developing mobile apps? Then just, I was
because mobile apps is huge on in practice, it's a huge infrastructure problem. Like, have you tried developing mobile apps? Then just, I was
9:11a, I was a mobile app developer,
a, I was a mobile app developer,
a, I was a mobile app developer,
a, I was a mobile app developer,
S Speaker 111:23And Daniel, for most mobile app builders, they would want a dual experience, right? Like for most mobile app builders, they would want a mobile app and a web experience,
And Daniel, for most mobile app builders, they would want a dual experience, right? Like for most mobile app builders, they would want a mobile app and a web experience,
And Daniel, for most mobile app builders, they would want a dual experience, right? Like for most mobile app builders, they would want a mobile app and a web experience,
And Daniel, for most mobile app builders, they would want a dual experience, right? Like for most mobile app builders, they would want a mobile app and a web experience,
S Speaker 211:33right? We do have it, yeah, most of our revenue come from Web. Like, 8% revenue come from rome.com. Mobile App is just, like a thing that we did for marketing, and obviously it's very good
right? We do have it, yeah, most of our revenue come from Web. Like, 8% revenue come from rome.com. Mobile App is just, like a thing that we did for marketing, and obviously it's very good

11:49I mean, you're, you're essentially going up against
I mean, you're, you're essentially going up against
I mean, you're, you're essentially going up against
I mean, you're, you're essentially going up against
S Speaker 211:51lovable, right? I mean, kind of, but we just support mobile only. So although work apps do work on web, but we just hit it because we want to, like, just focus on the mobile problem, and then we can obviously bring back back so, but like workouts, they already work on the web as well. Just like, has some of the same design as well.
lovable, right? I mean, kind of, but we just support mobile only.

S Speaker 112:11Like you focus on mobile, but you said most of your revenue comes from them. What? Like, what is
Like you focus on mobile, but you said most of your revenue comes from them. What? Like, what is
Like you focus on mobile, but you said most of your revenue comes from them. What? Like, what is
Like you focus on mobile, but you said most of your revenue comes from them. What? Like, what is
S Speaker 212:17that? No, I mean, we so basically we have a website called work.com the last to go to mobile apps. Yeah. And then the work, the apps the work make, also, not only work on as embedded as native apps support native APIs, but also they can be compiled to the web because of the nature of React Native but we do, do not focus on the like the apps or web we don't have web hosting, because then we will be confusing, like people, whatever
that? No, I mean, we so basically we have a website called work.com the last to go to mobile apps. Yeah.

S Speaker 213:26it can be added in a day just, just the question of, Do you want to be compared to like the web app builders? Because obviously the web app that work generates are not like as beautiful as like react once, because React Native is not optimized for web, but I think that react native web improves will lead into that more we just don't only be like, promoting like we are. The Web App Builder is better when we were not the web app builder, right? But all the apps that you make will work. You can also deploy web apps, and they will work like, if you want like, the most beautiful web app, then you should go to basically, well, but then it will not work on mobile. Yes, we just have to pick this right now. It's a choice in the future, there is no reason why will not be a choice, and we will be much better positioned because we own the harder part. And the easier part is just, you know how many web app builders, they're like, not even like.
