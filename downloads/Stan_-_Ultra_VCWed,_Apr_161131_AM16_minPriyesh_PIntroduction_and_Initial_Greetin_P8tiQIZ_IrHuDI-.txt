S Speaker 32:00likewise, yep, sounds awesome. Sounds awesome. Would you want me to start Sure? Absolutely. So we as a fund, we are quite young. We've done 30 deals so far, 302

2:16Yes, three zero, that's nice,
Yes, three zero, that's nice,
Yes, three zero, that's nice,
Yes, three zero, that's nice,
S Speaker 32:20yeah, but we have a badges, so it's like also accelerator, and we've done it in just 15 months. So we have to do it quite a lot of them. So we've done we are on full batch right now, and we have to batch three. So we invest small ticket in the beginning, 70k cap and cash, app and services. But then, after the three months of the remote program, we give our founders up to 300k of additional capital if they also have a lead investor, or they showed like they grow very fast. We are focusing on companies in impact space. So anything with input we can invest mostly right now, what we see is a lot of like AI companies in Education, Health Tech, like sports, wellness, HR tech, and we have a lot of companies which are based in the US, and a lot of companies which are based in Europe. So it's usually, it's kind of hopping up sometimes founders their registered company in developer, focus on US customers, but also stay in Europe for cost saving purposes. Yeah, I think that's early stage. Yeah. That's also important. Early Stage precede seed. Usually we invest one company has some traction, like a little bit of revenue at least, so we can see that founders at least can sell Right,

S Speaker 23:49right. Thanks. And that's that's interesting. So inside impact, I guess impact is a big umbrella. But under impact, do you have any specific industry focus?

S Speaker 34:04So we really like mental health. We really like education, health tech, HR tech. So like also corporate education, like, we like a lot, but we invested in things like FinTech with impact, or like circular economy. So we're very flexible with that, right,

S Speaker 34:32We usually don't. We we look at the impact metrics when we accept startup in the program, yeah, but after that, we don't track their impact metrics.

S Speaker 24:42Understood. Understood Stan, yeah, maybe I can give you a background about Qualcomm ventures. So I think our focus areas are slightly different. But of course, there can always be overlap. I'm a Senior Associate here. I work in the AI investment team. I work directly with our Managing Director and the fund itself. We have been around for about 25 years or so. We are the corporate venture arm of the Qualcomm. Uh, have deployed more than $2 billion in capital, and currently have about 250 plus active portfolio companies. So our focus areas are particularly like, if you can imagine, Qualcomm has its chipsets going in, a lot of mobile devices, a lot of PC devices. Now it also has a cloud computing platform, a lot of AR VR devices. So any software or hardware technologies which can come downstream from that is where we invest. So AI is a big focus area for us. We have done infrastructure investments, anthropic, hugging, face, scale AI, so some big names. There we are. Also we are looking very active AI applications this year. So AI applications or vertical AI applications agent, take AI things like that. Apart from that, we do a lot of IoT investments, computer vision, industrial application, automobile, tech stack, ar, VR, robotics, so slightly deep tech in focus. And then we are later stage. So we would come in series A or later, and our check sizes would be two to 10, $15 million we have done very late stage investments as well, like immediate pre IPO rounds as well, sometimes opportunistically in AI we have done some theory investments.

S Speaker 36:32We have some really cool companies, which I think would be interesting for you maybe a little bit later. But since you mentioned computer vision, we have this cool company, because you probably know open CV, right? I don't know open city, it's like computer vision library, yes, I guess Yes, yes, the most popular one, right? Computer Vision library and the founders of Open CV, they created a company which turns video into 3d muscle humans. So they can take, like they can take a video of football players, for example, and they take, they turn it in the real time, into 3d models of football players. So for example, it can be used for analytics tracking. Every post can be tracked, like speed, acceleration, all of that position, and they sell it like to big sports associations as well, or to, like healthcare providers. So they are essentially selling the technology through API and they're not like building those applications, they're just selling tech. So that one might be interesting, because they also, just couple of days ago, received a ticket term sheet from a lead investor. They were raising 2.5 million for their like Priyesh V Brown, but they already received 4.5 million commitments, so they're eventually popular among

S Speaker 28:06investors. I can imagine that the team sounds amazing, and it's an area we are looking at very closely, personally. In the past few weeks, I have looked at a few figma to 3d CAD to 3d take a picture, turn it into 3d companies, but those are mostly application players, not the infrastructure player like you mentioned. So seems like a very interesting one.

S Speaker 38:29Stan, yeah, yeah. And it's like, probably the best team to do it. The Open CV is used by, like, meta Snapchat, like they powering the whole computer vision infrastructure. So I can send you the website so you can have it twice. Yeah? Let me know you want probably it's like for later rounds. But still, it's nice to have relationship with a founder early. Yeah,

S Speaker 39:05Very interesting in terms of vertical AIS, we have some applications, application AI for like HR tech or education corporate education, like as you know, like they pull your whole knowledge base in your company, and they create courses. These guys have really nice LMS system as well. So essentially it's like full cycle education for your employees and new employees. So they're doing quite nice and growing quite fast, but they're also small, round, just 1 million. And we have also HR tech guys who are also in the early stages, and they are doing essentially whole record recruiting. So in case Qualcomm wants to do AI recruiting or try those guys could be also interesting. They are in New York, based in New York, yeah, and growing quite fast as well, like 30% month of month as well.

S Speaker 210:13appreciate that, Stan. So Stan, like for some of these vertical AI companies that you've invested in, how do you see the growth currently in the market, because the stories like Merck or all over the place, people are like, at least the investors that I talk to, and even my team internally, everyone is expecting very fast error growth. So do you see that happening at early stage? Companies that you're talking
appreciate that, Stan.

So Stan, like for some of these vertical AI companies that you've invested in, how do you see the growth currently in the market, because the stories like Merck or all over the place, people are like, at least the investors that I talk to, and even my team internally, everyone is expecting very fast error growth. So do you see that happening at early stage? Companies that you're talking

So do you see that happening at early stage? Companies that you're talking
S Speaker 310:41to there is quite fast growth, like we see, 30% for those companies, the Fit wise, which is first one, they earned half a million in first five months of launching. So we expect them to grow as fast for course or like applications, it's like, to be honest, there's a lot of them, both of them, and I think the vertical applications will, like probably win the race there, because they are focusing on just one, one thing. We also invest at lower valuations. I think if you compare it to something very famous and something which is based in Bay area, so or the the Fit wise, was quite big valuation to its it was seven, 15 million pre money, 17.5 poke money raised, I think it was our first money which went in was maybe a 2 million valuation. And also for the evolve, it was maybe free of 5 million. So for us, we can wait a little bit more. And for us, economics works. I mean economics of the fund, because we entered really early, yeah, into them. So for companies which, which you have to enter at like 50 million or 100 million valuation, there needs to be a lot of growth, very fast, because it might be that there is not enough money in the world to to get, for you to get your money back, like with open ARS. Yeah,

Yeah,
S Speaker 212:25we are seeing so many of those companies right now, seed, seed stage, don't have a product pre, pre product, pre revenue, and they're raising at 100 million valuation. So, yeah, the market is crazy. I totally agree.

S Speaker 312:40And sometimes it's not even like people of the level of Ilia subscriber, because, like, he's done that with his SSI and no product, no revenue. But how much is era to build in valuation?

13:00Yeah, probably something like that.
Yeah, probably something like that.
Yeah, probably something like that.
Yeah, probably something like that.
13:05So, yeah, we try to do completely opposite.
So, yeah, we try to do completely opposite.
So, yeah, we try to do completely opposite.
So, yeah, we try to do completely opposite.
S Speaker 213:10I agree. I agree. That's that's a great, great strategy. How, how do you usually source the companies you invest in?
I agree. I agree. That's that's a great, great strategy. How, how do you usually source the companies you invest in?

S Speaker 313:19So because, like a lot of our companies, they they have some roots in Europe, and then very often, founders move to us physically, or at least they move their company there or their customer base. They're switching their like focus on that. So for us, it's a lot of building network with local investors and a lot of marketing. So we have like separate people who do marketing on founders. Yeah, I don't like a lot of VC firms have like separate, like marketing department, but we do. We have marketing department and which is targeting specifically on founders, right?

14:26that would be amazing, sure.
that would be amazing, sure.
that would be amazing, sure.
that would be amazing, sure.
S Speaker 314:29And the same with us, to be honest, we sometimes come across a lot of late stage companies also, like in in different verticals like I also interested in

14:43quantum computing? Yes,
quantum computing? Yes,
quantum computing? Yes,
quantum computing? Yes,
S Speaker 214:44we have a couple of investments in quantum computing. It's a space we are excited about. But again, within the team, we don't feel we have necessary knowledge or expertise to evaluate some of those deals. So that's where, like, it's a hit and a miss sometimes, but we have, we did the follow up round. We are investors in quantum machines, which is a very well known name in quantum and then it's a space we look at here,

S Speaker 315:19because a couple of weeks ago, I got across some of the companies because I got connected with some family office which really focuses on quantum computing. So also, we'll keep you in mind for also, like cheap applications as well, and AI, which is connected to, like, compute infrastructure, for sure. So yeah, yeah, that sounds good. Sounds like a plan
