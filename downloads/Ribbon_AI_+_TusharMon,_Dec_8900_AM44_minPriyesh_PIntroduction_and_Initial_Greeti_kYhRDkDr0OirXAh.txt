S Speaker 24:04Likewise, awesome to meet you, to have a bit of context, obviously, happy to jump in, give, give some of the background on me, and then we'd love to show you product. Happy to talk about where the business is at, and exciting. Exciting days ahead. I'm in Toronto, but I'm from the UK originally, actually moved here six years ago now, five years Okay, yeah, see, I've been in Toronto for a little bit, but started off in the UK. Have been in the AI world since around 2014 which is when I was doing my PhD. I can see you now. The camera's working, yeah, so PhD in 2014 enjoyed that a lot, but thought kind of academia wasn't for me. So went out into industry at that point and went out to build products basically like that. I, like early on, kind of realized that was my passion is getting yeah, I've had powered products into people's hands. And so worked for a couple of companies, led one of the AI recommendation teams Amazon, where I was working on product recommendations. So anytime that you would see a product recommendation on the Amazon homepage, especially the recommendations bar that was, that was my team, and we would use info about you from, you know, what was the last thing that you bought, what was the last show that you watched? Like, all the info we could get our hands on, honestly. And then I also was head of AI at a company called Ezra, which is recently acquired by function health. And in a lot of ways it's interesting, because that's where the revenue story started. Because I actually met my co founder there, Ezra. So I was the head of AI there. My co founder was the head people on talent. And we met because the whole company was expanding very fast. We were hiring a lot of people. And so I worked really closely with Dave, because, you know, he was in charge of all recruitment. I was in charge of AI, which is really, like the core part of the company, and what, what we were betting the future of the company on in a lot of ways. And so the hiring into my like group was like of utmost focus. It was, like the most important thing for the whole company. And on top of that, hiring, AI people, as I'm sure you two, are super, super aware of, is just really hard in general. And so as a company, we just have to spend disproportionate resources on on hiring. And so when I was at Ezra with Dave, we started noticing a couple of interesting things that, like sparked us, us going down this road. One of them was that we noticed a bunch of applicants were applying using chat, GPT generated resumes. And this, if you look at the job market now, like essentially every applicant does this, right? It's like, totally widespread. But we we started noticing this when it was like, one in 50 hours, maybe, right? So like that. And we found it like, like, initially amusing. We're like, Oh, that's interesting. This looks like a toy thing. And then we got more obsessed with it. We're like, Okay, actually, this is starting to grow now. It's at one in 50. It's like five and 50 of these applications are like that. And then we got scared. So we're like, Well, okay, this is actually going to grow like this will eventually be 50 out of 50. What does that really mean? You know what's happening. And we like, made a few guesses early on, which turned out to be right, one of them, which was that every applicant is going to be doing this, and result of that, it would mean that, essentially, job applications kind of become worthless, right? Because all the applications start to look the same, and even the worst candidate is able to write a really good resume now, right? Because all they have to do is say, here's the job description, here's my current resume. Now create what would look like the perfect resume for this role. It's like you don't need to be smart to do that anymore, right? Whereas, if you went back five years, you have to be smart to do that, like, on some level, right? Or, like, a good fit. And so we noticed that, and like the we started thinking more about the second order effects of that, you know, like, what happens to the economy when? When that's the case, that means that hiring will actually become a lot less efficient in in a lot of ways, because this information that used to be at the top of the funnel in the first step of the application process is now un and we were fascinated by just that concept and the like, next leap that we made was okay, if that's the case, it means that people are going to rely more and more on interviews, right? Because, like, the only real signal left in in the end to end job application process is like, actually speaking to the candidate, like, interview them, understand who they are. And this has kind of always been the case like, I'm sure, as you two have hired in your careers, like, you know that within five minutes of interviewing someone, you have a pretty good sense of like, Are they good or not, right? So we all kind of know this, and then a lot of the rest of the application process is like the long tail of info, but just five minute conversation, you have a pretty good idea. And so the the core idea of ribbon is, let's, like, scale up that, like, conversation aspect, right? Like, let's create agent that can interview anyone for any role. It can hold conversations for up to 90 minutes if, if a company wants to. Our average interview is around 22 minutes right now, but we have some companies that go all the way to 90. We have some that do two minute interviews, right so like the whole range, we have an agent that can show emotion. It can ask you the best questions that you've ever been asked. One of the reasons that's possible is because our AI agent can research for actively 10 hours before the candidate actually interviews. So we have read your last blog post, we have your LinkedIn, we have your resume, we have your cover letter. We can even look up your co workers. Like, who did you work with before? What's their experience? Right? So like, if you're a software engineer and you say to have that, you have react experience. But we looked up all of your colleagues, and we saw not a single one has any react experience with that. Like, were you the only one that had react experience in the whole team? Like, interesting kind of thing that, like a really good recruiter, if they have the time, they would do that, but they usually don't have the time, where as an AI agent can essentially do that for each and every interview, right? So, like, that's, that's really, like, the core of the ribbon experience is that you can have this really incredible interview, it we have an AI agent that shows emotion, it sounds like a human being.

And so when I was at Ezra with Dave, we started noticing a couple of interesting things that, like sparked us, us going down this road. One of them was that we noticed a bunch of applicants were applying using chat, GPT generated resumes. And this, if you look at the job market now, like essentially every applicant does this, right? It's like, totally widespread. But we we started noticing this when it was like, one in 50 hours, maybe, right? So like that. And we found it like, like, initially amusing. We're like, Oh, that's interesting. This looks like a toy thing. And then we got more obsessed with it. We're like, Okay, actually, this is starting to grow now. It's at one in 50. It's like five and 50 of these applications are like that. And then we got scared. So we're like, Well, okay, this is actually going to grow like this will eventually be 50 out of 50. What does that really mean? You know what's happening. And we like, made a few guesses early on, which turned out to be right, one of them, which was that every applicant is going to be doing this, and result of that, it would mean that, essentially, job applications kind of become worthless, right? Because all the applications start to look the same, and even the worst candidate is able to write a really good resume now, right? Because all they have to do is say, here's the job description, here's my current resume. Now create what would look like the perfect resume for this role. It's like you don't need to be smart to do that anymore, right? Whereas, if you went back five years, you have to be smart to do that, like, on some level, right? Or, like, a good fit. And so we noticed that, and like the we started thinking more about the second order effects of that, you know, like, what happens to the economy when? When that's the case, that means that hiring will actually become a lot less efficient in in a lot of ways, because this information that used to be at the top of the funnel in the first step of the application process is now un and we were fascinated by just that concept and the like, next leap that we made was okay, if that's the case, it means that people are going to rely more and more on interviews, right? Because, like, the only real signal left in in the end to end job application process is like, actually speaking to the candidate, like, interview them, understand who they are. And this has kind of always been the case like, I'm sure, as you two have hired in your careers, like, you know that within five minutes of interviewing someone, you have a pretty good sense of like, Are they good or not, right? So we all kind of know this, and then a lot of the rest of the application process is like the long tail of info, but just five minute conversation, you have a pretty good idea. And so the the core idea of ribbon is, let's, like, scale up that, like, conversation aspect, right? Like, let's create agent that can interview anyone for any role. It can hold conversations for up to 90 minutes if, if a company wants to. Our average interview is around 22 minutes right now, but we have some companies that go all the way to 90. We have some that do two minute interviews, right so like the whole range, we have an agent that can show emotion. It can ask you the best questions that you've ever been asked. One of the reasons that's possible is because our AI agent can research for actively 10 hours before the candidate actually interviews. So we have read your last blog post, we have your LinkedIn, we have your resume, we have your cover letter. We can even look up your co workers. Like, who did you work with before? What's their experience? Right? So like, if you're a software engineer and you say to have that, you have react experience. But we looked up all of your colleagues, and we saw not a single one has any react experience with that. Like, were you the only one that had react experience in the whole team? Like, interesting kind of thing that, like a really good recruiter, if they have the time, they would do that, but they usually don't have the time, where as an AI agent can essentially do that for each and every interview, right? So, like, that's, that's really, like, the core of the ribbon experience is that you can have this really incredible interview, it we have an AI agent that shows emotion, it sounds like a human being.
S Speaker 410:57And is this a voice interview, or is this one of those Mar like experiences.
And is this a voice interview, or is this one of those Mar like experiences.
And is this a voice interview, or is this one of those Mar like experiences.
And is this a voice interview, or is this one of those Mar like experiences.
S Speaker 211:03What's the right? Right now? It's voice only, and it's very deliberate, actually. So we've, we've tried a video avatar. Yeah, we've actually also tried the same tech that Marco is using as well. And the the honest truth is, it's not good enough, like that, even the best that's out there. And one of the feedback that we hear a lot about merco is that it's creepy, and that's the issue with video right now, actually, is that, like, it's very hard to get video right, because we are really good at, like, video perception, right. Like humans, we have a billion evolutionary, like, years essentially associated with that. And so it's it's hard, whereas on the voice side, we've already crossed uncanny valley, and it's already good enough, already seems like a human being. And like a lot of our feedback on the voice side is, I can't believe that this wasn't a human like, like a lot of people kind of confused and disbelief, the kinds of questions that they get, and the kinds of emotions it's shown, they think, like, oh, there's no way that that wasn't a human being. But yeah, the video stuff is coming. But I think, like, realistically, we're probably still a year away from having really good real time video that is, like, on the right side of Uncanny Valley.
What's the right? Right now? It's voice only, and it's very deliberate, actually. So we've, we've tried a video avatar. Yeah, we've actually also tried the same tech that Marco is using as well.

S Speaker 412:19Yeah. And I agree with you, yeah, those, those video interviews that I've seen as are, don't really, I mean, I think most people, for most interviewers, it'll put them off, and then they don't know, yeah, but what about like, voice so do they just get a call like which is, they just sit on a computer and then they hear a voice and then they respond.
Yeah. And I agree with you, yeah, those, those video interviews that I've seen as are, don't really, I mean, I think most people, for most interviewers, it'll put them off, and then they don't know, yeah, but what about like, voice so do they just get a call like which is, they just sit on a computer and then they hear a voice and then they respond.

S Speaker 212:45That's right, yeah, we can also phone call out like that. So that's an option that we have to and yeah, and it's and if you look at most interviews actually happen over the phone anyway, especially the first round screenings, yeah. And so it's something that, like a lot of candidates
That's right, yeah, we can also phone call out like that. So that's an option that we have to and yeah, and it's and if you look at most interviews actually happen over the phone anyway, especially the first round screenings, yeah. And so it's something that, like a lot of candidates

S Speaker 213:04yeah, this is something that we're we're a little bit unusual, and that we have a lot of our own stack that we run on our own infrastructure. We, for example, we have our own text to speech. This is like almost everyone else in the space just uses 11 labs, yeah, but we're one of the only ones that doesn't, and we have a pretty good reason for that, actually, yeah, yeah. One is margins, like, we actually have really good margins, like, we don't have to pay 11 labs a ton. And the other is that, if you run an interview using 11 labs, and this is actual data that one of our customers has, they collected this, they compared us versus 11 labs, and they found, if you run an interview using 11 labs, you run, let's say 1000 interviews, 10% of those interviews will have some kind of voice issue. And so the examples there are screaming, laughing, unusual emotions, pronouncing things in the wrong way, all that kind of stuff, like things that are really critical and interview setting. And same study, they ran 1000 interviews using us of this, of this 1000 they found five issues right. So, like half a percent or less even right. And so huge, huge difference between those, okay?
yeah, this is something that we're we're a little bit unusual, and that we have a lot of our own stack that we run on our own infrastructure. We, for example, we have our own text to speech.

S Speaker 414:23And then I guess you can continue to fine tune as you get more data.
And then I guess you can continue to fine tune as you get more data.
And then I guess you can continue to fine tune as you get more data.
And then I guess you can continue to fine tune as you get more data.
S Speaker 214:26And that's correct, if you use case, that's right. So like it's we have very likely the largest interview data set right now as a result of just more than more. So I think that they are not able to train on their actual interviews, right? So, like they're so and, and I believe we're actually interviewing at a faster rate. One of the reasons why is because

S Speaker 415:34Oh, so you're able to hire even like deep tech engineer.
Oh, so you're able to hire even like deep tech engineer.
Oh, so you're able to hire even like deep tech engineer.
Oh, so you're able to hire even like deep tech engineer.
S Speaker 215:41Not only can we actually like, the feedback that we get is that our agent is much more technical than the average recruiter, and so is able to ask really technical recruitment questions up front, right, like, right, right in the first stage, whereas usually with a recruiter, you know, they would say, like, oh, I don't really know much about battery engineering, but here are, like, the key wise that I'm looking for, you know, but it's not like that with our agent. It's more like, Do you have experience with this? And you're able to get, like, extremely technical conversation,
Not only can we actually like, the feedback that we get is that our agent is much more technical than the average recruiter, and so is able to ask really technical recruitment questions up front, right, like, right, right in the first stage, whereas usually with a recruiter, you know, they would say, like, oh, I don't really know much about battery engineering, but here are, like, the key wise that I'm looking for, you know, but it's not like that with our agent.

16:14and so most of this,
S Speaker 416:18so Tesla uses it for screening, right? Which is, which is still very good, which is, so use it for screening. And then, of course, if they like the candidate, then they'll send it to

S Speaker 416:34Now, do you measure the conversion rate of the people that get screened to the people who get hired?

Now, do you measure the conversion rate of the people that get screened to the people who get hired?
Now, do you measure the conversion rate of the people that get screened to the people who get hired?
S Speaker 216:45Yeah, so there's a bunch of things we measure just as a result of lots of different customers care about different things, actually, but the core things that we found most most customers care about are what's the retention rate of an employee who was hired using this process, right? And one of the best data that we have on that is from a company called Eleanor. They like a shipping company, and they they found that if they hire someone using ribbon versus their their like traditional hiring process. At month two, they found 30% higher retention using the ribbon, higher deploys. And so why is that one? Well, for I think it comes down to one, actually very simple reason. Like in in the traditional hiring process, they would interview for each role, maybe 40 people. But they, they have a much bigger pipeline, right? So, like, what are the chances of the huge pipeline? Maybe 2000 people. You actually pick the top 40, right? It's kind of low, just from, like, a sampling problem, yeah. But versus ribbon, like, if you have 2000 applicants, you can just enter the old 2000 like, there is no issue there with that. And like, there's no like, scalability issue. We score, we rank them all, all that kind of stuff. And so the chances that you get the best out of the 2000 is much higher, right? Or like, or might not, get their best much, much closer to being the best.
Yeah, so there's a bunch of things we measure just as a result of lots of different customers care about different things, actually, but the core things that we found most most customers care about are what's the retention rate of an employee who was hired using this process, right?

18:21Yeah, we actually is.
Yeah, we actually is.
Yeah, we actually is.
Yeah, we actually is.
S Speaker 218:25There's three firms that have tried us, so, like, that's not like a huge market for us or anything, but we've led a couple of firms selves through, and they're, they're actually having a lot of success right now.

want to see how good this works. But okay, so that's
S Speaker 418:50those are, yeah, those are interesting stats. And then I would think, yeah, that makes very a lot of logical sense. What about the conversion from the people who you interview to to the number of people who get, well, I guess the percentage in this case might be less because you're well, no, from the people who you filter to actually get higher. Yeah, that percentage
those are, yeah, those are interesting stats. And then I would think, yeah, that makes very a lot of logical sense.

What about the conversion from the people who you interview to to the number of people who get, well, I guess the percentage in this case might be less because you're well, no, from the people who you filter to actually get higher. Yeah, that percentage
those are, yeah, those are interesting stats. And then I would think, yeah, that makes very a lot of logical sense. What about the conversion from the people who you interview to to the number of people who get, well, I guess the percentage in this case might be less because you're well, no, from the people who you filter to actually get higher. Yeah, that percentage

S Speaker 220:49That's right, but like, where, where we think we are, we like tend to be more right is that across the board, if you hire with revenue, you have higher retention, higher average performance on the job, and so with those, those two things we see as like, the most important, right? Like, if, if you improve your hiring process, and you hire people that stay longer on the job, and they perform better, it's likely that you've, like, improved something about your hiring process. But you are right. There's, like, lot of subjectivity. Two people on the same team would not agree on who's the right role. Things like that, right? You know, like that. There is a lot of that. So it's, it's not like a black and white, right or wrong thing, but we, we like, tend to improve the hiring across the board.
That's right, but like, where, where we think we are, we like tend to be more right is that across the board, if you hire with revenue, you have higher retention, higher average performance on the job, and so with those, those two things we see as like, the most important, right?

S Speaker 421:36And what's the measure? Which is like, for example, you do you measure the question that I'm asking, which is, do you measure how many, the of the people that you recommended? How many? What's the percentage that people get? They get hired? We do.
And what's the measure? Which is like, for example, you do you measure the question that I'm asking, which is, do you measure how many, the of the people that you recommended? How many? What's the percentage that people get? They get hired? We do.

S Speaker 221:54It's interesting. Our closest measure to that is so we, let's say we have a score, right, like we or actually however the company wants, but let's say we score out of five. We find it's very rare that, like someone with a score of a three or below actually ends up getting higher, right? So, like, our scoring tends to agree with the people that you also rank highly as well, right?
It's interesting. Our closest measure to that is so we, let's say we have a score, right, like we or actually however the company wants, but let's say we score out of five.

So, like, our scoring tends to agree with the people that you also rank highly as well, right?
S Speaker 222:43yeah, yeah, we do track a lot of that, but it can get extremely complex, right? Because, for some some roles, like, I'll just give an example, like, like a Tesla factory worker role, it role that they will just have open forever, and each week, like, for some of these roles, they're hiring around 30 people from from the same pool. They're always hiring, like, it's not a role that, like, opens and closes. And then you compare that to, you know, one of the VCs that we are, like, working with, they, they open one role every two years, right? And that's it. And it's like, they're like, a targeted like, search is very, very different, right? And so it can get kind of complicated as a result of that, right? But we do one thing that we're like working to improve on is more and more signals for like, how does this employee actually perform on the job, right? Because that can, ultimately,
yeah, yeah, we do track a lot of that, but it can get extremely complex, right? Because, for some some roles, like, I'll just give an example, like, like a Tesla factory worker role, it role that they will just have open forever, and each week, like, for some of these roles, they're hiring around 30 people from from the same pool.

23:38you ask the hiring manager.
you ask the hiring manager.
you ask the hiring manager.
you ask the hiring manager.
S Speaker 223:40So we yeah, we asked. We also have connections to their ATS and the HRIS, so there's some level of info there, right? Some of the info that we can see, for example, like, was this person promoted? Right? That's like a longer term signal, yeah. So that takes a while, yeah, yeah, but
So we yeah, we asked. We also have connections to their ATS and the HRIS, so there's some level of info there, right? Some of the info that we can see, for example, like, was this person promoted? Right? That's like a longer term signal, yeah. So that takes a while, yeah, yeah, but

S Speaker 424:00I guess you can, over time, you can build those signals, and that's a, yeah,
I guess you can, over time, you can build those signals, and that's a, yeah,
I guess you can, over time, you can build those signals, and that's a, yeah,
I guess you can, over time, you can build those signals, and that's a, yeah,
S Speaker 224:05the other thing is that over time, we will assess those signals ourselves actually. So one of the use cases that we're actually working on is internal performance management interview. And so you would, you would do an interview with ribbon internally, and we will ask you, like, how do you think you're doing at your job? How do you think your peers think you're doing? We interview everyone. It's all AI mediated. And I think that that area is going to be just as important actually, as our current core business.
the other thing is that over time, we will assess those signals ourselves actually. So one of the use cases that we're actually working on is internal performance management interview.

S Speaker 228:06So for us, it's an it's an outbound motion, where we usually reach out to someone like, like the head of people on talent, CHRO, someone like that, right? And like we the way we position it is that we make your team look better, right? So we're not, we're not positioning it as like, Hey, we're going to replace your team, which I think in the long run, we will replace a good portion of that team. That's the honest truth, right?

28:32Like, why would not replace? I

28:34mean, like, what do you
mean, like, what do you
mean, like, what do you
mean, like, what do you
S Speaker 428:37like right now, if I have to work open position, then I just let the recruiter know, and then the recruiter for me, at least, all they do is they fill my funnel with people. So it's at a stage where I don't like if I don't have a referral, then I'm not going to wreck so
like right now, if I have to work open position, then I just let the recruiter know, and then the recruiter for me, at least, all they do is they fill my funnel with people. So it's at a stage where I don't like if I don't have a referral, then I'm not going to wreck so

29:01I Yeah, so then,
S Speaker 429:06like what you're telling me, if that works, if that system truly works, then you replace a recruiter.
like what you're telling me, if that works, if that system truly works, then you replace a recruiter.
like what you're telling me, if that works, if that system truly works, then you replace a recruiter.
like what you're telling me, if that works, if that system truly works, then you replace a recruiter.
S Speaker 229:11I think in the long run, we do, right, but it's just it's not a very good sales tactic to go in straight away.
I think in the long run, we do, right, but it's just it's not a very good sales tactic to go in straight away.

S Speaker 429:17I agree. But right now, how do you sell? Like I'm being a veteran advocate, which is, I'm the head
I agree. But right now, how do you sell? Like I'm being a veteran advocate, which is, I'm the head
I agree. But right now, how do you sell? Like I'm being a veteran advocate, which is, I'm the head

How do I see this as not replacing
How do I see this as not replacing
How do I see this as not replacing
S Speaker 229:28recruiters, right? And so the way we sell, and this is actually true as well, right? It's not just me kind of saying this, like we the way that we position it is your like, recruitment teams are overworked. They're like, going from one interview to another, but the real value, like, the actual value that most recruiters add is at the negotiation stage, right? It's like, that's when you're actually closing a candidate, this upfront screening, where they spend all day on the phones, and already adding that much value. And it's also taking away from, like, the really important part, right? And so the way that we sell it is reallocate their time so they can spend all of their time on closing those recruits, right? And and so that actually tends to resonate really well, because it's just an on, on the ground problem,
recruiters, right? And so the way we sell, and this is actually true as well, right?

I agree with that, for sure. So
I agree with that, for sure. So
S Speaker 430:39yeah, and then yeah, I agree. I mean, I think, yeah, I can assist, but for the foreseeable future, even in closing, by just being making the person better aware of what else
