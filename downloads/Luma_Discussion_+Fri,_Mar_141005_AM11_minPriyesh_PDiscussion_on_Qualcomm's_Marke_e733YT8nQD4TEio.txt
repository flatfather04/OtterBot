S Speaker 10:04Hey, hi, Albert, good morning. Hey, morning, Priyesh, are you? I'm good. I'm good. How are you in the club earlier? Yes, yes, yeah, I'm surprised. It's an interesting company. Again, no more. I think probably Harvey would take a big chunk of that market. But I'm surprised we have, we even have, like a Qualcomm story to build for something like that, because otherwise we wouldn't even look at a company which does not have a deep tech angle or such.

S Speaker 20:37Yeah. Well, I guess patent traffic is actually highly relevant to Qualcomm,
Yeah. Well, I guess patent traffic is actually highly relevant to Qualcomm,

S Speaker 10:43like Qualcomm as a customer, I get that. But would we do companies where Qualcomm would

S Speaker 20:48be a big customer? Could be a big customer. Just think about how many patents. Oh, you have six patents as the investors. Just think about how many patents.

1:00How did that come around? Albert, how do you have an investor?
How did that come around? Albert, how do you have an investor?

S Speaker 21:05Years ago, I was looking at the startup, like, wireless video communication space, yeah, there was like, P zero, like, bunch of companies trying to stream, actually video to, like, to display wealth. So then that's the only thing that, hey, analyze all these companies, they all try to use Wi Fi or technology, but at a time, FCC just opened up a TV band white space, so it's a new spectrum. And say, why don't you just send that signal through the TV band white space and modulate it as a TV signal so all TVs can receive it. So so there was something like innovation, competition, yeah. So I pair up with the engineer and COVID. We kind of put some idea together and kind of submit that. And I think we wanted, like a first second, second, second prize. Then let me show that actually the project was CEO at Wi Fi, use RTP link instead of, instead of this Pip. So even in the process, we actually dropped like six times. Well, even there's two COVID Interesting. So let's

2:12talk about Luma AI.
S Speaker 22:19just curious about your general interaction. It's the Google foundation model has started. So

S Speaker 12:26yeah, I recently came across this one company called Cosmic brain. I would send you the deck. They are very early, raising a seed round right now, ten million and they are in the same space. And then I work with Bucha on perceptron. So I feel I understand that market a little bit. I've done some diligence. So that was exciting. Initially, I was just looking at it from a video generation perspective, and I thought maybe the edge that we feel Luma would have is the Amazon partnership and the network partnership that they mentioned yesterday. So some of those could accelerate the GM part a lot. And maybe this market wouldn't really be the best model wins everything, but the best distribution would win. So I think that's a good story for Luma to sort of for us to make an investment. But the World Foundation model. Aspect of the thing really makes it way more exciting for me. And I feel yesterday I also saw this one company, Moon Valley. So they launched a video generation model in partnership with a specific studio, and their entire model was trained on their proprietary content. And that makes it way more easy to offer a lot of these movie studios because they don't have any patent infringement. The Netflix, sort of Netflix partnership for Luma could do the same, and they could, it could be a really big plus point for them. So overall, seems like a very interesting prospect. I would

S Speaker 23:25love to work on that. Yeah, I agree with your assessment. I think the I think their approach to video generation, right, just wanted to manifestation of their publisher model, underlying approach. I think that's able to truly understand how the physics works and how you perceive the world in order to generate some real estate in the moment. So, yeah, so, so I think there are two steps to respect. So one is look at them as a World Foundation model company and try to compare against those. The other is, I guess, more intermediate one, just look at them as a video generation company and trying to figure out case there. I think, I think probably we should do both, because model, I think there are a few companies out there robotics, right? A lot of inspirational stuff, but where it's gonna how they monetize, how they scale. I think all these are scale. When we make questions, one of the biggest questions, when I see all these robotics, foundation model, physical, AI, it's always a healthy scale labeling. Otherwise, you know, if they rely on tele operations or, like, heavy human labeling, and just not gonna cut anything. But if you take the approach, will never get chat. GPT, yeah, human, human adjusted everyone. It's almost impossible, because they found a way to sell it, because it self supervised learning. And therefore we can scale this one up to very much more than the emergence will happen. I think the same, same thing, in a video generation space, in a World Foundation model. I don't feel like the industry is there yet. Because when I asked them about, they still buy a lot of label, but because, I guess they use AI to enhance the label about this process, right? So I guess, you know, one of the key questions we probably should ask further is that, when they have the video training library from Netflix, like, how do you go through that? So like, what aspect, what aspect they can be automated? I think that might give us an assessment of how realistic and How scalable is in both condition or approach they can be with that approach, right, right? So with
love to work on that. Yeah, I agree with your assessment. I think the I think their approach to video generation, right, just wanted to manifestation of their publisher model, underlying approach.

S Speaker 15:37perceptron and this kind of the company, cosmic brain, what I've seen is both of these companies have these companies have exclusively partnered with a labeling startup, third party provider, and, in fact, even takes strategic investments from them, so they understand that labeling is a very big part of their workflow going forward, and they're using some of this. But again, that doesn't solve the entire

We just need to see but I think I feel like that's it. He hasn't really needed details. But for many other companies we talk to, I feel like they're not really relying on human memory to do everything, because otherwise they can't really train data, right? Like talking about, there's a physical environment, and because we're doing this reality, and we get feedback from tomorrow, and these are, these are real feedback. You don't need to label someone, to label it for us. And the physics, we bump into walls and we touch things, we get feedback. These feedback mechanism, and we've got

S Speaker 26:49So that will be good to use a little bit more just, just trying to get the idea of the market. We are worse. Everybody is, I think, also jump into the space right as their customers, Model X, AI is also playing in that space, of course, not mentioned physical intelligence company,
So that will be good to use a little bit more just, just trying to get the idea of the market. We are worse. Everybody is, I think, also jump into the space right as their customers, Model X, AI is also playing in that space, of course, not mentioned physical intelligence company,

Google's playing in that space, yes,
Google's playing in that space, yes,
Google's playing in that space, yes,
S Speaker 27:14some, like research, physical explanation. So everybody, kind of more or less know that approach just depends on how and when they get there, and what's the what's the waypoints and when they stop by. Yeah, so, so back home, I think one question I have is to find out more quantitative research on the market side of video generation, video generation with Netflix using this, I think also in Amazon Prime studio using this, they're Using offset us, yeah. So for one simple reason, I think the creative, creative designers are union. They will not allow this to be used in the US. So definitely 3% and when I talk to Sony, so Sony ventures, they invest in runway pretty early on. They know this space, right, because they only studios, into the creative process. So they pointed out it's actually not that easy to be used in the production pipeline directly, but it's easier and prototyping. So we probably should be in there a little bit as well. I think since they know things wrong with so far from everyone, so probably start from there, see if we can find out more information about runways market, like where their product is deployed, within the prices, and that probably give us some communications marketability. Talk to runway CEO a few years ago. I don't know if they're still willing to talk to us, if they're willing to actually, yeah, if he's willing to talk to us, and it'll be good for us to talk to him, right? To say, to see what the company has done, the progress is, and we probably can pick up some really good intelligence there. I think that's probably the most direct competition, right?
some, like research, physical explanation.

I think since they know things wrong with so far from everyone, so probably start from there, see if we can find out more information about runways market, like where their product is deployed, within the prices, and that probably give us some communications marketability. Talk to runway CEO a few years ago. I don't know if they're still willing to talk to us, if they're willing to actually, yeah, if he's willing to talk to us, and it'll be good for us to talk to him, right?

So are they directly doing for a robotics application in the process? Do they hit some computer vision applications, things like that? And I think Amit had a slide on that as well. So do you want to model that specifically, or do you want to sort of just look at the broader

S Speaker 110:51started on these two aspects, the market sizing and comparing the market with other World Foundation model players. And then we'll get back to you probably next week. Yeah, sure, yeah. Yes, yes, yeah, are you in video for the interview next night, next week, Monday night, Thursday night. Okay. Okay, perfect. I find some time then sounds good. But if have any of the decks or any of the material, would love to sort of forward them to me
