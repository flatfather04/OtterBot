S Speaker 24:22Got it, got it? Is there where you're from? Or do you have roots there? Yeah, I was born here. Okay, okay. Very interesting, very interesting, very great to connect. Have you? Have you met with the Qualcomm or Qualcomm ventures team before,

S Speaker 14:41I guess maybe one of my co founders had a connection with you, but it was probably like seven years ago. Yeah, so happy like you will be great together with pressure, absolutely, what are you up to and the details?

S Speaker 24:56Absolutely, absolutely. Felipe, so great to connect. I think I was especially more excited to connect here because Qualcomm as a company, has been diversifying its offerings in the last few years, if you just follow the trend, Qualcomm was initially a mobile player, mobile chipset and networking player, but then more recently, we have expanded into Mobile plus PCs plus cloud data centers, plus Xr IoT devices. So a lot of different surface areas, and most of these surface areas can run AI models on on the silicon itself. So it's an inferencing chip on the device. We are pushing forward the edge frontier quite a lot, and in the same front we feel we can, our chipsets can power a lot of robotic applications in the future. And hence, robots is a big focus area for us. We have recently met, say, so many robotic companies. We are definitely sort of looking to partner with a lot of companies in the space. We recently invested in Figure AI. So there's a lot of internal push in robotics as a segment, especially because Qualcomm chips, Felipe, because it's originally a mobile chip, it's, it's designed to be very power efficient. So the best sort of, I would say, accuracy per unit of power, and that's why a big, big push in robotics. Just so that's the broader context. And then, just from the fund size, we are stage agnostic. We do anywhere from two to $10 million a lot of areas, especially where we feel we can support the founding team, either through go to market, Qualcomm as a customer, a lot of engineering partnership, those kind of offerings. And then AI robotics is a couple of big areas in investment as well for us, plus data centers. So yep,

7:37Yes. So this is my second company.
Yes. So this is my second company.
Yes. So this is my second company.
Yes. So this is my second company.
S Speaker 17:42My first company was a food delivery platform for Latin America that we sold to delivery hero back in 2015 then in 2017 we moved to Berkeley, and we got the UC Berkeley Skydeck fund to be our first institutional investor. We started with a food delivery robot that's still an important part of our business. A few years ago, a couple of years ago, we launched our art cargo that is a robot for the semiconductor space. So our lighthouse account there. It's Intel. So as we as we speak, we have robot moving cheap workers at the Intel factory in Oregon. And last year, we also started the development of manipulation robot for the food sector, taking account of our our customers. We have many customers in the on the delivery space that were restaurants or food providers. So they started to request manipulation services and and that's when we started to research more about he started, like, the development of a human right, yeah, specifically for the food sector that's still in research, let's say, like, R and D phase, but we're going to jump into commercialization, or like the first scale up into two next year. We're about, we're about to do the jump to that phase. And also we are. We started the development of an enhanced delivery device, slash roboc, also last year. So to reflect that growth and to reflect the ambition of our product suite, we made the decision to purchase the robot.com domain and rebrand as robo.com that rebrand officially happened a couple of months ago. We're doing business@robo.com and what would the promise our main like, like brand? I'll make a pause here in case that you have a specific questions about about the company and what we

S Speaker 29:49have done. Yeah, so super interesting rebranding, for sure. Felipe, I must say, I went to the website. It looks really good. It and branding part of it also looks pretty amazing. So congrats on the rebranding. It looks top tier for sure. And Philly with quick questions on the product line. So you said most of the product line today is delivery. Is all of that? Say in house delivery? Any specific verticals where you are more in like you mentioned, restaurants, but roughly how do how much of our entire revenue is coming from delivery, and of that, how much is coming from different verticals? Top verticals for you, perfect.

S Speaker 110:30So vertical wise, we have four main verticals, delivery, yes, and that includes urban and college campuses and golf courses. The second one is like industrial, and that's where our, our space there, our, our specialization there. It's, it's, it's food automation, yeah, yes, yeah, yeah. The third one is advertising, so we use our robots as as smart devices to enhance the out of home experience for customers that want to promote or like find different ways to spend their dollars, mark their marketing dollars, and that's it. So we have delivery, food, automation warehouse with the labor of semiconductor space and advertising

S Speaker 211:24Got it. Got it. Super interesting. Felipe, why? Why sort of go about with some of these different verticals like these are verticals with different use cases, for sure, and then the needs go to market. Everything is very difficult, so super interesting. But why did you

15:00We found that some
S Speaker 215:52makes sense. Makes sense. Felipe, and I must say, I've spoken to many robotic companies. This is a very unique approach. It seems like you are approaching it go to market first, like applications, real deployments. That's the edge you have today. I've spoken to the likes of physical intelligence and all the model companies, they're building, a general purpose model can can be interesting, but you You seem like you have a lot of real traction immediately. And that's in a way, is feeding into it, and hence it's emerging as a platform, which could be pretty interesting. I agree, for sure. And so Felipe, you mentioned moat would be deployments. How do you so let's, let's take one vertical, let's say the Sodexo food manipulation side, right? What platform do you have today? What do you need to build to sort of get deployment in that space, and then will that become another market for you? How are you thinking about it? Yes.

S Speaker 116:55As a note, we already have an actual robot developed. We already have a robot deployed in a non customer facing facility in the Bay Area, and we expect that we will showcase results to the world in early q2 and we will basically open it to the market. We have, as I mentioned there in our board, we also have one, the co founder of sweet green joined our board, Nicole nice and and, and even he told me, like, hey, we would like to test this in sweet green right away. I said, like, let's wait until we finish this first research and development. We're very they. He's very excited into into doing and also, like, they just saw one of their robotic companies into wonder. I don't know if you're, you're familiar with the with the Yeah, and so I do think that it's a we have a promote from a board, from a process perspective. We have a very strong go to market the strategy on that vertical, and, and, and the product is already again, we are partnering with Asian companies on the mechatronic side. We're keeping control of the esthetics and the PCBs on the sensor stack and the computer. And we're partnering with physical intelligence on the AI development for the autonomous roadmap for us, but we are lining up and keeping control on the B to B contracts and ensuring that the implementation is our mode of that's one example that vertical alone. It's already, we just, we unveiled the robots few months ago, and it's already, I think that by next quarter, it will sort of pass already, the $1 million in revenue. It's just that that food automation is just starting, and we're not even doing the effort to sell it yet.

He's very excited into into doing and also, like, they just saw one of their robotic companies into wonder. I don't know if you're, you're familiar with the with the Yeah, and so I do think that it's a we have a promote from a board, from a process perspective. We have a very strong go to market the strategy on that vertical, and, and, and the product is already again, we are partnering with Asian companies on the mechatronic side. We're keeping control of the esthetics and the PCBs on the sensor stack and the computer. And we're partnering with physical intelligence on the AI development for the autonomous roadmap for us, but we are lining up and keeping control on the B to B contracts and ensuring that the implementation is our mode of that's one example that vertical alone. It's already, we just, we unveiled the robots few months ago, and it's already, I think that by next quarter, it will sort of pass already, the $1 million in revenue. It's just that that food automation is just starting, and we're not even doing the effort to sell it yet.
As a note, we already have an actual robot developed. We already have a robot deployed in a non customer facing facility in the Bay Area, and we expect that we will showcase results to the world in early q2 and we will basically open it to the market. We have, as I mentioned there in our board, we also have one, the co founder of sweet green joined our board, Nicole nice and and, and even he told me, like, hey, we would like to test this in sweet green right away. I said, like, let's wait until we finish this first research and development. We're very they.

S Speaker 218:52Super interesting, Felipe. And just in the robotics a food automation space, the sort XO implementation, what kind of task would the robot be performing?
Super interesting, Felipe. And just in the robotics a food automation space, the sort XO implementation, what kind of task would the robot be performing?
Super interesting, Felipe. And just in the robotics a food automation space, the sort XO implementation, what kind of task would the robot be performing?
Super interesting, Felipe. And just in the robotics a food automation space, the sort XO implementation, what kind of task would the robot be performing?
S Speaker 119:03Yeah, so we are, as part of the goal that, as part of what we're doing is because we know what we have implemented. We have already implemented more than 500 robots and and we have already, like, made millions of tasks. And know what the what are the complexities of deploying robots. So what we do in all our implementations is that we first do an analysis, so we have a computer vision technology that allows us to basically understand what are the tasks that need to be done we are right now to that process with Sodexo. And, yeah, I think that that's an information that maybe we can disclose as we go deeper into the process.
Yeah, so we are, as part of the goal that, as part of what we're doing is because we know what we have implemented. We have already implemented more than 500 robots and and we have already, like, made millions of tasks. And know what the what are the complexities of deploying robots.

And, yeah, I think that that's an information that maybe we can disclose as we go deeper into the process.
S Speaker 120:28That's correct, and that gives us flexibility on the on the product roadmap we're going to have by early it's already in our website, but some of those robots were still we are, we're not in a scale up yet, but by q2 we're going to have a full product suite of robots because, like, compared to figure that you are investors, but we don't, we don't do the full AI, yeah, we don't do the like, it's so we just focus on the implementation, but ensuring that the important parts that could affect maintenance that could affect the adoption of robots are under our control, like esthetics computer, like fine tuning the hardware, yeah, having control of the sensory stack on the computer.
That's correct, and that gives us flexibility on the on the product roadmap we're going to have by early it's already in our website, but some of those robots were still we are, we're not in a scale up yet, but by q2 we're going to have a full product suite of robots because, like, compared to figure that you are investors, but we don't, we don't do the full AI, yeah, we don't do the like, it's so we just focus on the implementation, but ensuring that the important parts that could affect maintenance that could affect the adoption of robots are under our control, like esthetics computer, like fine tuning the hardware, yeah, having control of the sensory stack on the computer.

S Speaker 121:26Yes, so I can. I'm going to give you a note. I cannot give forward looking next year, okay, but I can. I can give you information into this year. So into this year, from an organic perspective, we're going to do almost in the north of $6 million in in in revenue. We're closing an m&a right now on the food automation space. Okay, so with that, put with that m&a, we're going to be close to 15
Yes, so I can. I'm going to give you a note. I cannot give forward looking next year, okay, but I can. I can give you information into this year. So into this year, from an organic perspective, we're going to do almost in the north of $6 million in in in revenue. We're closing an m&a right now on the food automation space.

Okay, so with that, put with that m&a, we're going to be close to 15
21:56a pro forma revenue. So performer revenue is 15
a pro forma revenue. So performer revenue is 15
a pro forma revenue. So performer revenue is 15
a pro forma revenue. So performer revenue is 15
S Speaker 122:01million the the towards next year, then it's and maybe that gives me kind of like the space to tell you what has been our fundraising history and what our fundraising plans to see if that this could be a match yeah for Yeah. So we recently raised that $20 million dollar round last month. We are one. Do you have just, do you have any AI note taker or something turn on?
million the the towards next year, then it's and maybe that gives me kind of like the space to tell you what has been our fundraising history and what our fundraising plans to see if that this could be a match yeah for Yeah. So we recently raised that $20 million dollar round last month. We are one. Do you have just, do you have any AI note taker or something turn on?

S Speaker 222:34Not yet. Do you want me to turn it on? Or you can
Not yet. Do you want me to turn it on? Or you can
Not yet. Do you want me to turn it on? Or you can
Not yet. Do you want me to turn it on? Or you can
S Speaker 122:37just, I just need it for complex you have, you don't have any AI, no, okay, yeah. So a company, a public company, tried to acquire US last year,
just, I just need it for complex you have, you don't have any AI, no, okay, yeah. So a company, a public company, tried to acquire US last year,
just, I just need it for complex you have, you don't have any AI, no, okay, yeah. So a company, a public company, tried to acquire US last year,
just, I just need it for complex you have, you don't have any AI, no, okay, yeah. So a company, a public company, tried to acquire US last year,
S Speaker 222:49yeah, because that's not surprising. Yes. So, so, so, because
yeah, because that's not surprising. Yes. So, so, so, because
yeah, because that's not surprising. Yes. So, so, so, because
yeah, because that's not surprising. Yes. So, so, so, because
S Speaker 122:53of that process, we started a PCA will be out the process of our financials. We started that PCA will be out of the process of our financials. And then I wasn't sure about that my mission and vision will be implemented after the m&a, so we decided to not take that path, and we have had already a very advanced PCA will be out of process, and a couple of banks approach us to review the possibility of taking the company pop right now, we are technically under registration, and we are in basically very advanced process of that we close up. We have raised $25 million this year. We closed $20 million last month, we're going to do an extension of let's have a private placement that it's a pre IPO round. We have as our lead investor for the IPO, the cantor fits out. We also have William Blair and Craig Helen. We engaged crayfellian Last Thursday to be our investment banker and advisor for this private placement. So this is basically like a private placement before a public transaction is going to be a clean IPO, and we're just preparing ourselves to raise a significant amount of capital in the IPO, increase the like the credentials of the company. We want to put us out there. And that's something that we believe that, of course, it comes with some pains, but we are, we're willing to suffer those pains and also use the stock as currency for future m&a that will enhance our strategy vertical wise, that's a so I would like to, yeah. So if this is a interesting for you, then any information needs to go through our investment bank, and I can make the introduction so that you can access to the different roles of data rooms that we have
of that process, we started a PCA will be out the process of our financials. We started that PCA will be out of the process of our financials.

S Speaker 225:00fair, agreed, agreed fairly, so, when, when are you roughly targeting the IPO? How, what's broadly timeline in your mind? And it seems like, do, do you think it's a, say, an early decision to make it an IPO? Or, do you why an IPO at this stage? Do? Why? Why Why are you not thinking of, say, a long term growth and then an IPO ma'am?

S Speaker 125:25We need, we need to, like robotics are happening. I was just in hand show last week. They're happening fast, and I need to move fast. Yeah, I do like the capital requirements to implement the vision that we have in the next 24 months are in the north of $300 million yes. So there is a handful of people that can give us $300 million right now, and I feel just more comfortable, and I already have a very strong full like, like syndicate to raise that money in the public markets. You can also see companies like surf robotics, that is one of our competitors, yeah, with tech robotics that they are trading at. Their trading volume is very high. Their revenues are lower than us, and they have been able to tell a story. We also, as I mentioned, we have a very strong board, we have a very strong executive team. Yeah, we have strong customers, we have a strong pipeline, we have a strong narrative, a strong brand, and we feel that if we are in the public market, we will be able to access that capital earlier or in much more control. Yeah. Second, we will increase the profile of the company as a robot public company. That there are a few actually makes sense. And third one, we can use the stock as currency to consolidate and bring founders to enhance our vertical go to market strategy.

S Speaker 226:40Makes sense. Makes sense? Philippo, yes, I agree. Totally so interesting, definitely interesting for us. We'd like to take a look. How big an extension Are you raising right now?
Makes sense. Makes sense? Philippo, yes, I agree. Totally so interesting, definitely interesting for us. We'd like to take a look. How big an extension Are you raising right now?
Makes sense. Makes sense? Philippo, yes, I agree. Totally so interesting, definitely interesting for us. We'd like to take a look. How big an extension Are you raising right now?

26:51So the the floor is
S Speaker 126:56there is a there is an investor that already asked if they can do Teddy but the process is started literally this morning.
there is a there is an investor that already asked if they can do Teddy but the process is started literally this morning.
there is a there is an investor that already asked if they can do Teddy but the process is started literally this morning.
there is a there is an investor that already asked if they can do Teddy but the process is started literally this morning.
27:06Yeah, so it's, it's still, we're, we're
Yeah, so it's, it's still, we're, we're
Yeah, so it's, it's still, we're, we're
Yeah, so it's, it's still, we're, we're
S Speaker 127:09not, we just raise around and we want to, but it's our board is very controlled, and because we have revenues that it's, it's, yeah, so it's, that's part of the of the of the investment bank strategy process that we will need to go through.
not, we just raise around and we want to, but it's our board is very controlled, and because we have revenues that it's, it's, yeah, so it's, that's part of the of the of the investment bank strategy process that we will need to go through.

S Speaker 227:26That makes sense? Makes sense? Felipe, yes, we'd love to evaluate it. One concern on my end is that most of my team is off already, so we will not be able to engage before Jan, say, after the first week of Jan. So timing wise, does that work for you, or are you sort of looking to close it as soon as possible?
That makes sense? Makes sense? Felipe, yes, we'd love to evaluate it. One concern on my end is that most of my team is off already, so we will not be able to engage before Jan, say, after the first week of Jan.

S Speaker 127:47So, and this, again, I cannot, because then, like they a lot of these information we're looking to close the round end of January.
So, and this, again, I cannot, because then, like they a lot of these information we're looking to close the round end of January.
So, and this, again, I cannot, because then, like they a lot of these information we're looking to close the round end of January.
So, and this, again, I cannot, because then, like they a lot of these information we're looking to close the round end of January.
27:58Sounds good. Sounds good.
Sounds good. Sounds good.
Sounds good. Sounds good.
Sounds good. Sounds good.
S Speaker 128:00And we have, we have, we're starting the process now. We have data room. And maybe the process, maybe that sometimes the NDA and accessing the data room, that something that will happen between these and next week, and then maybe your team in the first week of January, called job, yes, like 100% with all the efforts into, into, into digging more.
And we have, we have, we're starting the process now. We have data room.
