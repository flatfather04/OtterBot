S Speaker 10:00Twitter, when they're posting, they want multi platform. It's kind of like all these they want multi platform. So they want both Instagram, tick tock and YouTube, shorts, three, all three, which are the biggest ones. They want all of those three. And they want to run the same ads. They don't want like YouTube. YouTube to create some ads, then Google's platform to create some ads, and Instagrams platform to create some other ads, and tiktoks platforms to create some other ads. So they want a single place where they can generate ideas and push it. So that would be the argument where I think like is the like, that defense against

0:49the walled gardens,
S Speaker 10:51right? The challenge is that the walled gardens could still go and create them, and then they need to get that feedback. And this is where, like, I feel like we need to talk to somebody in Instagram ads, truly,

S Speaker 22:04and they will essentially do it. Tushar so Facebook like I think I told you this, but Zach, in his annual presentation last quarter, mentioned this exact thing that they want to get there. Multi platform play is definitely a hedge for creative but I will try to see if there are other other wedges that these guys cannot replicate. I think that would be the

S Speaker 13:34My only like the upside case over there is it think about, like, maybe that's, that's a benefit?

S Speaker 33:46Yeah, we all know that that's a negative. Yeah, right. But,
Yeah, we all know that that's a negative. Yeah, right. But,
Yeah, we all know that that's a negative. Yeah, right. But,
Yeah, we all know that that's a negative. Yeah, right. But,
S Speaker 13:51but with the fact that they are only targeting SMB, these agencies will also adopt these tools, right? But they all have like, the agencies will move slow and all of those things, they will adopt these tools. But the key is, you're essentially making you're democratizing ad generation, yeah, which means that you just increase the size of the market significantly. I mean, this is market creation. Whenever something like this happens, yes, you you can create new markets. Don't look at it from a lens of like traditional enterprise SAS or SAS businesses. The question is, does it create a new market? That's

S Speaker 24:38a very interesting point. Tushar, I haven't explored that, but that makes a lot of sense. The other way I was trying to approach it is that, do we really believe in the fact that to build an enterprise business in this space prosumer, you have to go through the route of prosumer, SMB, and why is that, essentially, is that, say you have a tire end to end engine running on feedback loops. You have to have high velocity ads going in and out. A lot of experimentation happening so that the LLM actually iterates, gets better on creativity and also develops all of these product specific parameters on how a better shoe ad works, how a better fashion ad works, et cetera. So on that front, it's also the thesis Ella is trying to push, right?
a very interesting point. Tushar, I haven't explored that, but that makes a lot of sense.

S Speaker 15:23Yeah, I agree. I mean, this is essentially Ella is saying that I've got a much better flywheel. Yeah, once I have enough people using my platform, my flywheel is what will, what will become the mount? Yes. And I buy that to a certain extent.
Yeah, I agree. I mean, this is essentially Ella is saying that I've got a much better flywheel. Yeah, once I have enough people using my platform, my flywheel is what will, what will become the mount? Yes. And I buy that to a certain extent.

S Speaker 26:01Yes, big disconnect. So I think Tushar, she meant when, when she's she's Arr, that is just a subscription business. And when she says 30, that's also including the usage data. So in her model, that's very like, specifically demarcated.
