S Speaker 10:00Qualcomm co founders. They have a lot of buildings over there, so there's a lot of affinity towards that. But anyways, Ella, we're excited about this. Yeah, it sounds like you're in the middle of I heard a lot of term sheets dealing with a lot of that this week, so we're excited to hear the story. So I think we have a quorum. So let's, let's start. Yeah,

4:38So you can see that.
S Speaker 410:58Joe, founders and business owners, your time is too valuable for clicking through dashboards. Heard simulator pros launching today, that AI agent that runs your computer sneak it into similars office right now, pretending I'm a service animal. I'm doing this illegal thing because I really want to show you this new thing called similar Pro. So

S Speaker 318:28couple questions real quick. So this diagram you draw the ideation LLM. Is that your own LLM? Or that's like you take an LLM and customize it or for a specific customer.

S Speaker 218:47Yeah. So this ideation om, we take from an open source, large language model, and then we do the post training for it using the real ADS data so it understand what is the better viral ads on you?
Yeah. So this ideation om, we take from an open source, large language model, and then we do the post training for it using the real ADS data so it understand what is the better viral ads on you?

S Speaker 319:03Okay, but then for a specific customer, whoever it is, right for bag, or maybe a different set of customers, very different things. Do you have to retrain this Eleanor?
Okay, but then for a specific customer, whoever it is, right for bag, or maybe a different set of customers, very different things. Do you have to retrain this Eleanor?
Okay, but then for a specific customer, whoever it is, right for bag, or maybe a different set of customers, very different things. Do you have to retrain this Eleanor?
Okay, but then for a specific customer, whoever it is, right for bag, or maybe a different set of customers, very different things. Do you have to retrain this Eleanor?
S Speaker 320:45So let me ask you one additional question, so that when you say you give data for all industry that's not just necessary ads or video Create generates, right? It could be from anybody. Is that right or No, like any ads,
So let me ask you one additional question, so that when you say you give data for all industry that's not just necessary ads or video Create generates, right? It could be from anybody. Is that right or No, like any ads,

21:02or this is only the ads you create,
or this is only the ads you create,
or this is only the ads you create,
or this is only the ads you create,
S Speaker 321:59Okay, so this ideation LLM is like LLM for once it's trained, it could be used for any industry, or that's not true.
Okay, so this ideation LLM is like LLM for once it's trained, it could be used for any industry, or that's not true.

S Speaker 232:09So you can see that our product consistency is much better compared to other products. And let me show you several other our users use case to understand. So first one is the beauty products, right? So I think everyone knows, like beauty products, and also some other like house use products, they have lot of text on the product itself. Let's say it has step one, step two, the logo, the name, blah, blah, blah. So the problem for that is we found aI have an issue for spelling most of the time. Like, if you have something called advanced, it will spell something like, instead of ADV, it will spell like ALB, or AD, O or something like that, right? So that actually is a problem for consistency. And when we test like pica, or even when it takes like Higgs, field, we find is not only it cannot not keep the counter or exactly the same, it will also change it from frame to frame. So you can see this text is changing, right, like at different time. So that actually is a problem for AI, when it have, you know, like, lot of text on the product, and that is something we, especially, you know, deal with it in our tokenizer to keep it consistent. A second thing, like I want to show is for the shoes.

33:40So let me find the shoes there.
So let me find the shoes there.
So let me find the shoes there.
So let me find the shoes there.
S Speaker 233:44So, like, one thing that you can see is that for the shoes, you know, like aI actually very, have very hard time to understand how people are going to wearing the shoes they may give a longer one, yeah, maybe let us go to clothes first. That's easier. So it's the same thing for clothes. So similar to shoes and clothes, the problem there is basically, like, if you give it the clothes, or if you give it the photo. They understand. Okay, this is the clothes, or this is the shoe, but it doesn't understand, how should I wear this shoe? Or how should I wear this clothes? And the problem there, you can see is that, first of all, this women like this clothes is like a puff, like puff shoulder or thing, and also it have a layered one with a silk as material, right? So when the women is walking on the street, the dress should actually, you know, flowing away that reflect the material is silk, instead of like cotton or other materials. And what we found is it's pretty hard for the AI to understand, Okay, for this clothes like, you know, the it should be like a layered dress, and it's silk, so it flowing away. That's more like a silk material, and how this person is wearing it, and how this puff shoulder thing is looking like that is pretty hard for us to do. And also, the same thing is for the lace. Lace is one of, you know, very hard I will see material or the dress for the AI to understand, because this is not fully transparent or non transparent, right? Some part of it have, you know, like the lace part, some part of it's not like that. So even if, when the people do some very hard gestures, it will be very hard for the AI to understand how this is wearing on the body. So all those, actually, you know, making it pretty complicated for the AI to figure out how the people should, you know, like, or how the product should interact with the person when it's rearing on the body. And that is some, you know, specialized tokenizer we are doing there and trained by our own, you know, like industry proprietary data, because we have been in E commerce for over four or five years, and we have lot of, you know, specialized peer data, together with material, the shape and the logo in our, you know, like database. So we use those specialized e commerce data to train our specialized tokenizer that keep the consistency and understand how the product is interact with the human being.
So, like, one thing that you can see is that for the shoes, you know, like aI actually very, have very hard time to understand how people are going to wearing the shoes they may give a longer one, yeah, maybe let us go to clothes first. That's easier. So it's the same thing for clothes. So similar to shoes and clothes, the problem there is basically, like, if you give it the clothes, or if you give it the photo. They understand. Okay, this is the clothes, or this is the shoe, but it doesn't understand, how should I wear this shoe? Or how should I wear this clothes?

S Speaker 336:42Can I ask the example you showed the clothes or the lace? For example? Yes, this is something you generated, and the input is this lady. I assume she's a real person and plus the clothes yourself.
Can I ask the example you showed the clothes or the lace? For example? Yes, this is something you generated, and the input is this lady. I assume she's a real person and plus the clothes yourself.
Can I ask the example you showed the clothes or the lace? For example? Yes, this is something you generated, and the input is this lady. I assume she's a real person and plus the clothes yourself.
Can I ask the example you showed the clothes or the lace? For example? Yes, this is something you generated, and the input is this lady. I assume she's a real person and plus the clothes yourself.
S Speaker 236:57So this person is a fake one. She's an AI and then what people include is just the clothes, just the clothes images,
So this person is a fake one. She's an AI and then what people include is just the clothes, just the clothes images,
So this person is a fake one. She's an AI and then what people include is just the clothes, just the clothes images,
So this person is a fake one. She's an AI and then what people include is just the clothes, just the clothes images,
S Speaker 337:05image of the clothes. And then you have a fake AI person. And then the video you generate puts the clothes on this fake AI person. Is that? Right? Yes, correct. Okay, so if then, let's say this, this and is it generate, people use fake AI person. So they use real, like models, I guess, real model, you have to pay them, right, I guess. But, yeah, easier,
image of the clothes. And then you have a fake AI person. And then the video you generate puts the clothes on this fake AI person. Is that? Right? Yes, correct. Okay, so if then, let's say this, this and is it generate, people use fake AI person. So they use real, like models, I guess, real model, you have to pay them, right, I guess. But, yeah, easier,
image of the clothes. And then you have a fake AI person. And then the video you generate puts the clothes on this fake AI person. Is that? Right? Yes, correct. Okay, so if then, let's say this, this and is it generate, people use fake AI person. So they use real, like models, I guess, real model, you have to pay them, right, I guess. But, yeah, easier,
image of the clothes. And then you have a fake AI person. And then the video you generate puts the clothes on this fake AI person. Is that? Right? Yes, correct. Okay, so if then, let's say this, this and is it generate, people use fake AI person. So they use real, like models, I guess, real model, you have to pay them, right, I guess. But, yeah, easier,
S Speaker 237:31that's true. Like, normally we generate using AI person, because you may have IP issue for you know, people, yes,
that's true. Like, normally we generate using AI person, because you may have IP issue for you know, people, yes,
that's true. Like, normally we generate using AI person, because you may have IP issue for you know, people, yes,
that's true. Like, normally we generate using AI person, because you may have IP issue for you know, people, yes,
S Speaker 337:39okay, got it. Got it. Okay. So you generate this AI person, or library of AI person, then you give them the clothes, or give it to the close, and then this LLM will generate this video, this lady walking. Is that right?
okay, got it. Got it. Okay. So you generate this AI person, or library of AI person, then you give them the clothes, or give it to the close, and then this LLM will generate this video, this lady walking. Is that right?
okay, got it. Got it. Okay. So you generate this AI person, or library of AI person, then you give them the clothes, or give it to the close, and then this LLM will generate this video, this lady walking. Is that right?
okay, got it. Got it. Okay. So you generate this AI person, or library of AI person, then you give them the clothes, or give it to the close, and then this LLM will generate this video, this lady walking. Is that right?
S Speaker 237:53That's true. That's true. So the LLM actually it generate, what we call it, the storyline, right? So, basically, like, let's go to this lace one. So it will say, first, this lady wearing this clothes, she is crossing the street, there's a car, then she's, you know, there's a camera, then she, like, shoot herself. Then, like, that is a story, right? So then, basically, is, if you use the image of this product on this AI person or AI model, and then it generates, you know, like frame. So for frame, we call it, it's like, you know, like different scenes, right? There may be four or five things for this one. So it generate the same and based on the scene, it generates a video clips. And finally, it become a full story of this lady wearing the dress, forcing the street. Someone is camera her, I don't know,
That's true. That's true. So the LLM actually it generate, what we call it, the storyline, right? So, basically, like, let's go to this lace one. So it will say, first, this lady wearing this clothes, she is crossing the street, there's a car, then she's, you know, there's a camera, then she, like, shoot herself.

S Speaker 338:53I see, but you're telling it right? This thing you should have four scenes, for example, and these are four seams. And then you tell it, this is the clothes to use. And then the LLM sort of puts it together, or generate the seam first, and then stitch it all together into this video. Is that right?
I see, but you're telling it right? This thing you should have four scenes, for example, and these are four seams. And then you tell it, this is the clothes to use. And then the LLM sort of puts it together, or generate the seam first, and then stitch it all together into this video. Is that right?

S Speaker 239:10Yeah, yeah, yeah. So you will give it like the close the URL, and what I will show you later on is we have a version that the AI will directly generate, which thing it will use, and finally generate the video clip. Yeah,
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So you will give it like the close the URL, and what I will show you later on is we have a version that the AI will directly generate, which thing it will use, and finally generate the video clip. Yeah,
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So you will give it like the close the URL, and what I will show you later on is we have a version that the AI will directly generate, which thing it will use, and finally generate the video clip. Yeah,
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So you will give it like the close the URL, and what I will show you later on is we have a version that the AI will directly generate, which thing it will use, and finally generate the video clip. Yeah,
39:26okay, okay, got it. Okay. So
okay, okay, got it. Okay. So
okay, okay, got it. Okay. So
okay, okay, got it. Okay. So
S Speaker 339:33what's the most the customer that's using your or use query to use to generate advertising right product related advertising, is
what's the most the customer that's using your or use query to use to generate advertising right product related advertising, is
what's the most the customer that's using your or use query to use to generate advertising right product related advertising, is
what's the most the customer that's using your or use query to use to generate advertising right product related advertising, is
S Speaker 239:43that right? Yeah, yeah, that's true. So most of the people, they are using us, they are trying to, you know, generate the ads video to run on the Facebook. Or is it on the Facebook, on the Instagram, on the Tiktok, yeah. It's mainly for, yeah,
that right? Yeah, yeah, that's true. So most of the people, they are using us, they are trying to, you know, generate the ads video to run on the Facebook. Or is it on the Facebook, on the Instagram, on the Tiktok, yeah. It's mainly for, yeah,

S Speaker 340:05okay, got it mostly product related videos, right?
okay, got it mostly product related videos, right?
okay, got it mostly product related videos, right?
okay, got it mostly product related videos, right?
S Speaker 240:09Yeah, mostly it's product related. That's the reason they really need the product consistency, right? So the thing is, like, if you do not have the consistency of the product, then, like, they cannot really seal it right? It's not like a 60 score to 80 score. It's like a zero to one. If I sell something that it doesn't look like it, customer would definitely return it. And that's that's a problem.
Yeah, mostly it's product related. That's the reason they really need the product consistency, right? So the thing is, like, if you do not have the consistency of the product, then, like, they cannot really seal it right? It's not like a 60 score to 80 score. It's like a zero to one.

40:34Yeah, yeah. Okay,
S Speaker 340:36okay. Now, in the case of JBL, that's a big company. Are they using you to generate ads for them? Like, I understand the individual may want to sell some stuff, like whatever, but JBL is a basically size company, right? Do they use your generate ads?
okay. Now, in the case of JBL, that's a big company. Are they using you to generate ads for them? Like, I understand the individual may want to sell some stuff, like whatever, but JBL is a basically size company, right? Do they use your generate ads?

S Speaker 144:06hello. Can you since we have a few, oh, talk about team. And and also funding, yeah.
hello. Can you since we have a few, oh, talk about team. And and also funding, yeah.
hello. Can you since we have a few, oh, talk about team. And and also funding, yeah.
hello. Can you since we have a few, oh, talk about team. And and also funding, yeah.
S Speaker 344:22And also, I'm curious to see I haven't, like, how does people actually use this like, did they just start sort of, like, go to your website, swipe a credit card, for example. Or, like, how did they actually pay?
And also, I'm curious to see I haven't, like, how does people actually use this like, did they just start sort of, like, go to your website, swipe a credit card, for example. Or, like, how did they actually pay?
And also, I'm curious to see I haven't, like, how does people actually use this like, did they just start sort of, like, go to your website, swipe a credit card, for example. Or, like, how did they actually pay?
And also, I'm curious to see I haven't, like, how does people actually use this like, did they just start sort of, like, go to your website, swipe a credit card, for example. Or, like, how did they actually pay?
S Speaker 244:33Yeah, yeah. I will use just like, two minutes to answer this question and cover this part so people are directly just doing the subscription to our, you know, website. And then basically, is the maybe there is a person who is doing the ads content in the team right, who needs you full and he will just use it. Then he will reverse to his company, something like that. And one important, and that's last important thing for us, is the idea customization. Which is very important is that, like we said before, is our AI for the idea, it actually categories into three things. One is a storyline, one is element, another one is the frame or the same, right? So how do we tell the a guy, how do you customize all the idea and storyline for each product? And we using that, basically, using the AB testing, you know, for different content and different elements for doing that ad. So, you know, like in our product, when people choose, like, a template, you know, like, this is idea template from influencer and upload their own clothing product. On the left side, we allow them to choose like different model or like different AI person. They can also upload their own influencer, you know, like model as well, and also it can choose like different background as elements. On the right side, basically is we allow user to include their URL. We support like, all the URL from the E commerce platform. After they include the URL, basically is, we will, you know, like crawl down all the product information, like the video, like the images, and also product name and description. So based on all those product information, we're able to actually generate different storylines, or I will see, you know, like different things for the AI, you know, to how to sell this product, how this video will be, storyline will be look like, right? There may be emotional one, there may be, don't worry, response bubble, or different things like that. So people can choose different storyline, people can choose different elements to generate their content. So after this content is generated, on the right side, we have a pop up window which asks the user to connect to their Tiktok and meta ads platform. And when the content is there, it will be uploaded to those ads platform. People will run the ads, and we will use the API to pull down the click through rate from that, those ad platform and feedback to our ideation. Aom, so after that, you know, like the ideation. Om, now knows, okay, I have blue background. I have purple background. Blue is much better. And I have, you know, like emotional storyline, or three reasons why I love the emotional so in that way, the AI actually understand more and more, you know, like, what is better idea and how should I choose different storyline and elements in the future that will result in higher click through rate? And that actually is the mode for us. Why? Because, if there's a new company coming in tomorrow, right, and they have the same thing as us, the problem is that they do not have enough, you know, business owners running those ads in their platform, so they do not get enough ads, feedback data, you know, to their ideation, Om, so they cannot generate higher click through, rate content or idea compared to our AI. And the business, no wonder, definitely will choose an AI that have higher ROI or CTR compared to another company, and that's a reason we have the first advantage mover, and that will keep our AI have better CTR and ROI compared to other competitors, and let me show you very quick of the before and after of our ideation Aom, like when it's before, a lot of feedback training and after a lot of feedback training, the capability of creativity of the AI is
Yeah, yeah. I will use just like, two minutes to answer this question and cover this part so people are directly just doing the subscription to our, you know, website. And then basically, is the maybe there is a person who is doing the ads content in the team right, who needs you full and he will just use it.

S Speaker 249:32So you can find that the you know, the ideation capability of this, AI actually is much stronger after we give a lot of data for feedback training, and that's a reason we are actually building our proactive ideation agent in three stage right now. That is why it's called proactive. That means it's not like a passive agent like Manus or just bar that people do you do not need to query it every time when it provides ID. Instead, we just ask the user to connect to their, you know, Amazon shop or eBay shop, to our agent, and then our AI will like we will give all the, know, the ADS data, feedback data, and all the trending social media content and all the influencer idea to the AI. So the AI will perhaps fully sense idea like 24/7, on its own. So when they generate different ideas, we will not directly run those ideas into the people's ads manager to run the ads. Instead, we will first do an auto idea testing the virtual market do the simulation. Why is that? Because we already get a lot of data for this business we understand for its target audience, like the blue sky is much better, the purple one is much worse. So our AI already understand what kind of content direction is targeting, user love. So like this simulation will tell or feedback to the ideation AI like, Okay, this blue one is better. Please redo the purple one so we'll only make or give the ads manager, the top performer, ideas for you to run the real ads to make our success rate much higher. And when the AI is running the ads on the agent side, it will automatically do the AB testing on its own, find a better you know, constant direction, you a more you know, like in depth, AI AB testing. And finally, find a viral content direction, and will copy from one content to one southern content in very short time. So you can see that it could adjust strategy.

Instead, we just ask the user to connect to their, you know, Amazon shop or eBay shop, to our agent, and then our AI will like we will give all the, know, the ADS data, feedback data, and all the trending social media content and all the influencer idea to the AI. So the AI will perhaps fully sense idea like 24/7, on its own. So when they generate different ideas, we will not directly run those ideas into the people's ads manager to run the ads. Instead, we will first do an auto idea testing the virtual market do the simulation. Why is that? Because we already get a lot of data for this business we understand for its target audience, like the blue sky is much better, the purple one is much worse. So our AI already understand what kind of content direction is targeting, user love. So like this simulation will tell or feedback to the ideation AI like, Okay, this blue one is better. Please redo the purple one so we'll only make or give the ads manager, the top performer, ideas for you to run the real ads to make our success rate much higher. And when the AI is running the ads on the agent side, it will automatically do the AB testing on its own, find a better you know, constant direction, you a more you know, like in depth, AI AB testing. And finally, find a viral content direction, and will copy from one content to one southern content in very short time. So you can see that it could adjust strategy.

And just very quickly, this is our agent. This is our agent. Like product, like you give it the URL, it will generate the idea itself. Then on the right side, it will generate, you know, all the sames, and then based on the same aims, you know, it will generate the beat I just want to show you.

Who how much is left?
S Speaker 255:56So, like, We haven't decided finally, whether we will go with the CO lead or just one lead investor. So it's kind of hard for me to tell right now how much exactly is left in this round, but in total, like, I think it will be, it will go over our target, to be honest, like, because we already have, you know, like four of them are processing right now. So, like, I think, like, yeah, that that is, like, flexible.
