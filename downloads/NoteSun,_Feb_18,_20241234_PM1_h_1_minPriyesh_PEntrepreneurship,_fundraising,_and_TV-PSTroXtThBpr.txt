S Speaker 21:43I appreciate that. Some some good growth. Thank you.
I appreciate that. Some some good growth. Thank you.
I appreciate that. Some some good growth. Thank you.
I appreciate that. Some some good growth. Thank you.
S Speaker 312:45Thank you. Yeah, ultimately, it sounds like you just kind of need to be confident your assumptions about the market and being able to like articulate those assumptions is really important to you go into the nitty gritty beyond that. You're probably dealing with investors that maybe aren't so comfortable with early stage ventures.

S Speaker 113:00Yeah, I need you need to know your cash flow form and stuff like where your key like you know, but you're probably breaking down your arrays into like 25% is going to go into marketing and 25% is going out. I always do chunks instead of you know, if anyone shows me a pitch deck with like, their whole income statement. It's like, nobody wants to go through that anyway. So it's better just to say roughly, and then they'll do snipped Yes. Like the fear of putting 75% of your raise into people. Why do you need to be so heavy and people that will be a play, but if they know it's a marketing driven business, and you're putting 50% of the raise and that 25% and ops and the other start out? That probably makes sense. So yeah. So I wouldn't worry too much about like not being a finance expert walk into a room great thank you.

S Speaker 413:48Maybe I can kind of you can go ahead and ask the next one.
Maybe I can kind of you can go ahead and ask the next one.
Maybe I can kind of you can go ahead and ask the next one.
Maybe I can kind of you can go ahead and ask the next one.
S Speaker 513:53Yeah. All right. I guess like this is kind of the flip side of the previous one, I suppose like since when you were found out but then like when you're investing and also when you're coaching what are the top criteria where you like to assist startups and founders?
Yeah. All right. I guess like this is kind of the flip side of the previous one, I suppose like since when you were found out but then like when you're investing and also when you're coaching what are the top criteria where you like to assist startups and founders?

S Speaker 114:12For me, if I mean they can be in and this is maybe a person thing, so again, take all these comments as like this is one person speaking to McClure I'm sure her experiences because you'll get different opinions. But for me when I'm investing, it's embedding founders. They could have the greatest business but if there's no the passion doesn't come out, I just like they lose me and and that's just something that for me, and if you feel like you're you're shy, maybe you don't convey that as much in person maybe bring again, bring somebody in who has a little bit more of that skill to present that because I think that is really important. That's my personal thing, right? Some people will just look at pure numbers in this business, but I also I'm backing a founder and I want to make sure that they're gonna have enough passion to get through the journey, right? Because like, like I said, there's ups and downs and I feel as a founder, one of your biggest jobs is maintaining that passion. So you have to, like keep yourself afloat enough to be able because otherwise, you don't have all the cash to bring in like the top people you have to bring them in on opportunity. And usually you're paying market rates unless somebody's giving you just like handing over a checkbook, but generally you're not paying beyond market rate. Right? But you've got upside you want to always step upside. So I want the founder to be able to be inspiring me or exciting, like exhibiting enough passion to me that I know that they can also assemble a powerful team, right and that people are going to follow them in their leadership. So that's a big thing. Having something particular with their background that is very seasoned obviously it fits your industry expertise. Then knowing that you've got the skill set in your background comes from whatever you're building, right like in that space. So you need to understand industry or if you come in with a functional expertise, like maybe you've been a CEO or another type of business, industry, another industry, but you're a great CEO and then you bring somebody in as a co founder or on your team who has the industry experience to complement so I look at how they're thinking about complementing because you're not going to have every skill. And if you're going to get VC backing, you're also not going to be able to likely build your business with one person because it's like build fast build big. So are they aware of what their strengths are and what needs to be complemented and how could they strategically complement their own like zone of genius, right? And the opportunity like how do they present the opportunity? Like you're obviously looking at that too, is this? You know, are they are they better than the others in the market, or is there a really unique whitespace here? Is this really an underserved market? So I'm looking at all things but I think it's the founders passion, their knowledge of their business has to really be strong, obviously, confidence in what they're building and the ability to make it because again, like you're gonna have things throw you off and so you need to have that will to continue to persevere if you get sidestepped right? And this would be my and I have to feel a sense of trust and honesty and authenticity and those kind of basic human characteristics if I don't feel like somebody is an honest or giving me or if they like, pretend they know things that they don't. Then that is a red flag for me because yeah, they're just basically yeah, you don't want yes people either, right. So
For me, if I mean they can be in and this is maybe a person thing, so again, take all these comments as like this is one person speaking to McClure I'm sure her experiences because you'll get different opinions.

S Speaker 118:03yeah, I think it's great to get experience if you find like, once you're working that you're like, Oh, I love this. I'd love to build a company in this industry. Doesn't matter if you have the top job in that industry. If you're in the thick of it, or you're building another company with somebody you learn how to build a company in that industry by being a part of that team. So just, you know, you can navigate that way and and you don't have to be the CEO of the company, but you could go and work with a founder, learn how they're building their company, and then when you're ready to go build your own. You've already had a bird's eye view. It's like you've been through it once. Without having to take the risk. Makes

S Speaker 418:42Julie, you mentioning previously that there is value in having different kinds of investors on your cap table from Chennai, strangers to institutional cells, both strategic and financial in nature? Like from a founders perspective, do you have any guidelines on how we can decide what kind of investor we should have on our cap table? Does it change depending on the industry, or the kind of experience the founder has in that industry?

S Speaker 125:24It's always been meeting that through introductions are my network so not just networking? I mean, UCLA has a powerful network, look at some of the ambassadors in the accelerators, some of the graduates who have launched some businesses in the same space.

And would you mind making you know, let them know about your your idea and they're excited and say, Would you mind connecting me to anyone you think I should be talking to I find the first time you'll have a lot of like, first time you raise you're probably gonna have a lot of introductory sort of meetings may be great if you just meet a couple of people and you get to checks in those are half a million your businesses off off the ground. But if you do want to bring in some angels, it's usually through once removed network, right. So I'll meet with somebody and then they'll say, oh, you should meet so and so because they know that those guys liked investment. space to the VCs will be it can be more targeted. It can be very fast. It just depends where you are doesn't cycle. And it's great. If it happens fast and you get the right investors. It's just you don't want to be you don't want to be at risk of not wanting just because you're too early for VC, right like doesn't mean you're not your business isn't worth raising capital for because you don't get your your VC on day one. It just you might need to be further ahead in that business model to attract them. That's

S Speaker 126:57And I would also not be shy about getting warm intros go a long way particularly with VCs but you can have somebody making more interest and even you give them some upside for like getting you connected to investors and it goes a long way for you but particularly the first time you're building a company, you don't have to lay that foundation and prove yourself and walk in the door. And you've already gotten a level of credibility because it came through a validated referral. And a lot of VCs only really look at companies that have been referred unless they're in at a point where the data speaks for itself. But some VCs only really talk to founders that have been have come through a warm referral. Certainly

And because I'm sure that has changed right in terms of how you because after a couple of years, you're also working with the presidents in Morgan Stanley, I mean, that would have given you a different perspective to look at the business. So I'm curious to know how your thought process changed. And when you actually decided to make the jump and kind of get into balance? That two part question so that that's the first part. And the second one is, if you look back, on your time, what would you say were the top two challenges that you did not anticipate when you started when you went out on this journey, right? And maybe one of the things that worked in your favor?
