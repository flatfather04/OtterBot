S Speaker 12:15I'm in San Mateo Lee, so in the Bay Area, and most of our Qualcomm ventures team are based here. Some members are in San Diego, where the headquarters is, but most of the team is based here, the investment partners, and in fact, I'm sorry Varsha was really interested in speaking to you as well. Varsha is a partner at Qualcomm ventures, and she's been with the Fund for more than a decade now, but she could not join. She had to travel as well, and when I moved it from Thursday to Friday, it didn't work out for her as well. So maybe we can. We can catch up with worship. Yeah, we can. We can loop in versha sometime and have another chat. Lee, but, but today, just wanted to understand tiny fish a little bit. But Quinn

S Speaker 13:04yes. So Quinn, Quinn manages all of our global investments. So we have offices across six different regions, and Quinn manages all of that. Tushar is the managing director for us investments. And then we have a set of partners working in the team, and then I'm the only say, principal level guy in the team. I work with all of the partners on our AI investments, and I'm particularly more focused on AI applications and infra investments.

S Speaker 23:32I see, okay, so I guess I always felt like Quinn was a big deal. I didn't realize how big a deal he was but we, we actually had a dinner event right after the pitch, and he sat next to me. So I got to know him fairly well, his life story, how he became this today.

S Speaker 13:57That's amazingly. I am originally from India, so I did my undergrad in India at a university called IIT Madras, and great experience. But throughout that entire journey, I was very involved in startups. So during my undergrad, I worked with 10 plus early stage startups, different project based roles, internships, full time roles, while studying full time, tried starting a venture of my own, which didn't take off as much, but I got really interested in that entire Spacely. So after graduation, I joined a clean tech company as an early business hire around Series A, and I saw them grew from series A to say they're filing for an IPO right now. I left when they had reached unicorn status, led a lot of new vertical businesses for them start a new business models. Great experience, very long sales cycles, like nine months, 12 months sales cycles selling to the likes of meta, Google. So great experience, but slow in that fashion, and I wanted to pivot back to more early stage entrepreneurship, so I moved to the US about four years back, did my MBA from UCLA, and again, during that same period, was working in venture for the entire time. So I've worked with Menlo Ventures for some time. I've worked with Morpheus ventures in LA for some time. And then I've been with Qualcomm ventures for about two years now, close to two years, invested in six AI companies. So I'm enjoying my whole year. It's very active. We are actively deploying capital and work with six new AI deals. So great experience overall. I'll say.

S Speaker 25:30What kind of I'll tell you more about, yes, what kind of companies do you focus

S Speaker 15:35on? So a couple of my investments, Lee, one which may be particularly more interesting to you, given tiny fishes, focus is it's a company called airtap. They are early stage infra. They're creating an infra layer to build agents for mobile phones. So using their infra, which can be, say, mobile use, equivalent to a computer use or browser use, API, you can automate all of the mobile apps on the App, on the mobile application across. So that's one of the companies I've done two computer vision investments early working with Tushar directly on them. One was in safety. So they create smart cameras for fall detection for elderly home cares. Surprisingly, a pretty good market, and it's growing very well. Another company was called NATO Dine, so Computer Vision Plus AI for fleet management and safety. Then I've done one investment in context AI which which is an AI native office suite. So it replaces all of your Microsoft Office Suite with an AI native workflow. Pretty good. We have a contract with them at Qualcomm as well. And then we did one investment in Figure AI, the human and robotics company. And then I'm also like taking a very strong look at video generation AI right now, hopefully we'll do an investment there and then taking a strong look at AI governance across enterprises, so model Security Plus AI governance, those kinds of companies

S Speaker 29:52Why do I spend then just two, three minutes catch up on what we do? I know you've heard a version of my pitch that was more like, you know, mid level, I think, in terms of how higher, right?

S Speaker 210:10I'll actually go higher level with you, just because you're in AI space, right? I'll say where, where our addition is coming

right? They're all, they're all brokering
S Speaker 210:29information, and that's like 100 plus billion for Google, right? Oh, yeah, probably even more for Facebook, or that stuff. We do think in the world of AI, right? That connective tissue between the need demand and supply information will not be a search engine. We want to be that bridge, but not in the way that people back chat GPD and say, Can you have my thing on, you know, your display? We believe the power is with the people who post information, not the broker. Yeah. So when we say we build web agents that can go out there and
information, and that's like 100 plus billion for Google, right? Oh, yeah, probably even more for Facebook, or that stuff. We do think in the world of AI, right?

S Speaker 212:36the most powerful insights live on the internet, and this is closer to the near term use cases, right? So we focus on web agents that can operate at a scale and can find sort of zero to one breakthroughs for insights. It's there's AI companies that have much brand or sort of ambition.

S Speaker 213:08know what Qualcomm would be looking at, sort of on the maybe it's a supply chain thing, whatever it is, right? Like we want to, we want to be the person that says you don't need to buy data from a data provider. There's a lot of people who just say, put it in the report and sell it to multiple buyers. We're saying, why would you need that? When you can actually just send out bespoke agents and do that and come back with information that is not standardized on the PDF review. It's actually exactly what you asked for. A couple of noise, right? But it's still from a long time. It's cutting from the noise, not by ignoring also like important sources, but it's actually picking up on each in each source, the most relevant, thick backing, right? So that's sort of the long term vision versus the near term. It's actually very aligned, but the near term use cases builds towards that is what I said second and the first part is like what we see the world become. So we're evolving a lot within that schema, because the core tactics is that we initially did a lot of retail scraping, because that is like, you know, Walmart wants to know how target sells their Turkey, right? And it's granular. It's by store. Now we're venturing into more wholesome use cases, if you will. Like insurance company you saw like they actually want to tap into long term providers. That's win women for everyone. There's no competitive dynamic there, yeah, actually, literally duplicate the system. We love those, so we do adopt those. And then we're also doing the developer platform, which natural language prompts in agents come out, and then we would, we would, we would charge you by consumption, right? So enterprise focused, enterprise quality, but developers within Enterprise can use our product without coming to us and show us the business case, because we don't need to know that the agent is good enough for you to do it yourself. We're still not one off, one shot agents like madness. We would never want to be that. Yeah, we don't claim to be versatile. We actually claim you have to spend your time trigger agents. Because for anything you want quick quality coming out, you have to invest the time in right? So just because we give you efficiency doesn't allow you to take shortcuts. Because if you take shortcuts and book vacations, you know, on open AI's agents, like operator, right? Like it or a comment, it won't give you the quality, because it's like, brand new to your brand new, right? So absolutely, yeah, actually, I was more like five minutes. I'll pause here, but that I don't, I don't usually pitch ourselves in that way, but I gave you like, the full truth of

S Speaker 219:52yeah, how I wasn't aware that you guys were doing that? That's pretty cool. But yeah, I think that'd be, that'd be super interesting. Is it sort of mobile focus. As you said,

S Speaker 120:03it's, it's not mobile focus. So it's, let me, I will send you some materials on that Lee, something that we send to our partners, post our calls, I would have just drop a link over here. And it's not mobile focus, so it's on device AI, which can also run on PCs and say on prem solutions as well. So if you, if you go to the ecosystem tab over, over there, you'll see a lot of different applications that we have already enabled in there, plus a lot of different infra companies that we plan to enable. So this could be one a good top of the funnel, developer, audience, capturing initiative for you, but I can have you connected with the team and speak more in detail around this initiative. This is something that we do in partnership with hugging face.
it's, it's not mobile focus. So it's, let me, I will send you some materials on that Lee, something that we send to our partners, post our calls, I would have just drop a link over here.

S Speaker 221:02I think, yeah, I think that. I so we actually Google, actually as well. There's somebody in sort of partnership conversations within tiny fish. So I can also my colleague on my end, and at least have a introductory call. So yeah, that sounds great, and I feel like I have to learn more about it before I I'd say anything more concrete for introducing us to that concept, even

S Speaker 223:52Yeah, I think so that works. I will. I'll prepared. I'll make sure it's tailored to because there's definitely some stuff in our material that's just obviously not relevant. We're also doing a beta launch on stage in two weeks. I'll make sure you have that as well. Because it announces our self serve platform. We actually say that's the easiest way to try it. Yeah, we you don't. You don't. You can do whatever you need with it. And because our use cases tend to be research based, right? So literally, like, imagine, like, you know, trying out Google when Google is not there, right? So it's like, what do I use Google for? You know, everything. Yeah, right. So I'll make sure you all have that as well. But, yeah, let me, let me get there, that information, give you, give you that sort of, you know, here, here's our data launch, and here's the link you can try, yeah, kind of thing.

S Speaker 125:25So we are very, very stage agnostic. So we have done seed rounds like airtap. I was mentioning we have a $2 million check there. So 2 million is something, is the smallest that we would go. But we have also done some very late stage pre IPO rounds where our check sizes have been 15 million. So it's very stage agnostic, two to 15. But I would say the sweet spot is five to seven, five to eight.
