0:20The day, but okay.
S Speaker 10:23Hey, hi, Mara. Hey, Priyesh, how are you? You're doing good. Thanks a lot for taking the time. Really appreciate it. Yeah, absolutely, yeah. I remember Eric had earlier told me that you guys were early investors at Klaviyo, so we felt must be a space that you have looked at.

S Speaker 31:01so we can introduce ourselves, Mark. So, you know, I manage the North America investments for Qualcomm ventures. Qualcomm ventures, we're a strategic investment arm for Qualcomm. Areas that we invest in are range across many different verticals and many different horizontals. Our businesses are around mobile our businesses are around IoT, automotive, networking, cloud, PCs, XR, a lot of different

S Speaker 31:41So we invest in areas that are pushing the boundaries of compute and connectivity across the board. So we think that edge will be a an inference node, just another inference node

S Speaker 32:01And many of these AI models will inference on edge devices in the future. And hence, like for example, a lot of our interests are on video, generative video use cases. We think that for latency and cost reasons, these models will run on these edge devices down the road. So we've been spending

2:25a lot of time across
S Speaker 32:30AI generative videos, including companies that are building their own models to companies that are using other people's models, and then marketing and ads tends to be like that's where most of the companies in this space are getting built. And of course, there's companies like Synthesia that are building more content for training and also now marketing now. So we've been talking to many companies in the space and more recent one that we've been talking to is creatively, but at the same time, we've been talking to a cool and we've been talking to we've talked to captions as well.

S Speaker 17:3422 Yes, 22 and
S Speaker 37:37then they had a different product before, and then about 1415, minutes months ago, they decided to do this generative video product for ads and marketing and and then they over the Last 1415, months, they're now at closer to 14

S Speaker 38:11But at the same time, you know, like, if you take a look at captions, over the last two years, captions has gone from zero 100, I believe if you take a look at Hagen,

S Speaker 38:35Then there's Higgs field, also doing really, really well. And then there's other companies in the space, like creative by and a bunch of others that have had viral growth. So clearly, one trend that we're seeing is that a lot of these influencers love this, because now this lowers the barrier to entry to this market, to for them to be able to create ads and marketing content. But then I think what we are looking at is like, okay, is this a winner takes all market? Is this multiple winners? Market is what differentiates one platform from another? Can they really differentiate over time with this if you're not building your own models, and even if you're building your own models, you need to then, if you're building your own models, you're a different company altogether, because you have to grow, go raise hundreds of millions of dollars. So those are some of the questions. And then, what does exit look like in this space? Are these companies that get acquired, and who are the acquirers, and

9:50is this an IPO space?

is this an IPO space?
is this an IPO space?
S Speaker 29:55Okay, those are all really good questions, just a couple of clarifying questions about the company, just so I fully understand the value problem on their site right now too. So it looks like they generate videos for ads and then do they also deploy them on ad channels, directly through Tiktok, Instagram, etc, yes.

S Speaker 310:19So the product is you they use their product to also generate ideas and storyboard the ads. So they have an LLM based product that they use to for creators to generate ads and content. Then that content gets used for actually generating the video frames. Then they when you push these ads to your social media platforms like Instagram, Tiktok, YouTube. Then after that, they have their own product that collects analytics of how these ads are performing on these platforms, and they use that data to go then feed into their ideation engine again to generate better ads to

okay, okay, cool. And then in terms of their wedge customer, like, who is their ICP? Are they targeting agencies a certain level of brand in terms of revenue.

S Speaker 112:03So they're mostly mid market, I would say Mara, a lot of SMBs and some influencers.
So they're mostly mid market, I would say Mara, a lot of SMBs and some influencers.
So they're mostly mid market, I would say Mara, a lot of SMBs and some influencers.
So they're mostly mid market, I would say Mara, a lot of SMBs and some influencers.
S Speaker 315:31and for play. So one of the things Mara which is so what our thesis is heavily also dependent on investing in founders that are deep tech. So we look at the research backgrounds of people. That's something that we index towards as well. So create these team what we found is, it's the team is has got a bunch of really strong researchers, PhDs, that have done AI research, and then they've got their own proprietary decoder models, they've got their own proprietary fine tuning techniques, and they've got their own so that's why you see the Quality of videos, and they've got a bunch of different differentiators today around the quality of videos.

16:27We still don't think they're defensible enough,
We still don't think they're defensible enough,
We still don't think they're defensible enough,
We still don't think they're defensible enough,
S Speaker 217:08Yeah, it's a good question. It's also it's a little bit of a tough call, especially because play and I assume creating Studio will continue to build across more ad channels, but the value prop is that they're on multiple ad channels, and you can easily run campaigns on many ad channels at once. And so
Yeah, it's a good question. It's also it's a little bit of a tough call, especially because play and I assume creating Studio will continue to build across more ad channels, but the value prop is that they're on multiple ad channels, and you can easily run campaigns on many ad channels at once.

And so
S Speaker 317:30adding more channels, I don't think Mara is a function of them not being able to add more channels. Adding more channels is a decision that they made because most of the ads, most of the revenue that's coming from is Instagram and Tiktok. Yeah, that's a adding more channels these days through like
adding more channels, I don't think Mara is a function of them not being able to add more channels. Adding more channels is a decision that they made because most of the ads, most of the revenue that's coming from is Instagram and Tiktok. Yeah, that's a adding more channels these days through like

17:58it's it's just adding more API support,
it's it's just adding more API support,
it's it's just adding more API support,
it's it's just adding more API support,
S Speaker 318:02or more connectors, building more connectors, and then there's third party to add connectors. I'm more like, I think like, the question is, has Have there been like, do ad agencies acquire these companies, if they ask them, what, what price, what are the multiples? Is that like? Is this an acquisitive space, even? Or do big tech acquire Are you familiar with any of the exit dynamics in this space?
or more connectors, building more connectors, and then there's third party to add connectors.

S Speaker 218:40I mean, I would say a space is changing, because previously you could only run an ad on meta by going to meta ads manager itself, and now you can run ads outside of those platforms. And that's another competitor is like the ad channels itself, if they get better at their own generative creative and their own optimization, that's also a competitor to create a studio and everyone in this space, although you

19:18will create their own ads platforms,

S Speaker 221:07So I don't actually know what will end up in this market. I think that. I think that the future of media buying in an automated fashion like I think that thesis in itself is something that will unfold,
So I don't actually know what will end up in this market. I think that. I think that the future of media buying in an automated fashion like I think that thesis in itself is something that will unfold,

21:28but I don't know who would acquire a business like that.
but I don't know who would acquire a business like that.
but I don't know who would acquire a business like that.
but I don't know who would acquire a business like that.
21:57So that's the biggest filter
So that's the biggest filter
So that's the biggest filter
So that's the biggest filter
22:01for us. And then after that, we think,
