S Speaker 14:29When you say like, just to understand, because I know I So, so far, I always knew perform to be like more series A but how's your overall philosophy of investment changed when you moved to seed, because seed has no PMF, there is slight or maybe no revenue at times, because it's a technology play. How do you guys normally evaluate those needs? So

and thanks for taking your time. And
S Speaker 16:35so I'll walk you through my journey, and I'll also walk you through what we have been doing at fiber, yeah, I think the whole season on interfaces, I also believe in that the only difference, why we position more marketing is because the world revolves outcome based. They don't care about what pool tech you are building. Yeah, sometimes they do, but yeah, but eventually it's all about, like, if you have dynamic interfaces, what's the value out of it, right? And that went majorly driven by for marketers, rather than anybody else, like the consumer experience, marketing, tax, marketing spend, cost, etc. These are the major values that come out of it. Yeah, you do seek money on developers, etc, but that's like a secondary pitch to end whenever, whenever I talk to anybody from CMO or CTO, yeah? So, yeah, that's the reason we started pitching it more, that we also like, we pivoted much like we learned a lot, and we pivoted like positioning slowly and swiftly. So, so it been, it's been a journey. Cool, yeah. So quickly, about me, almost 12 years of experience as a market tech person have done from in India. It's called ATL, BTL, which is, which is like TV, media, newspaper to being stationary in shops, and like selling word to mouth, yeah, door to door. And also, so I did that with Nestle and paper boat. So I was very early member at nesdi Center, and then with paper boat at both places, I launched very key products with them. So I was more focused on the new product development. Reasons to Believe. Why should we launch this product? How do we market the product? Etc. And then I did digital when I started my own om Company, which was end me, which was in women's health back in 2017 which I sold to first cry global bees, the subsidiary. So that's where I learned like digital. So that's been my gambit of entire marketing and marketing, right? And I think for me, the the key point was this whole inflection, technological inflection, of third party cookies going away and AI making things easier in terms of scaling and automating, right? So that was a critical picture, and that's where we decided, hey, we want to do something, but we were not clear what. And I had this one inside from end me, which was whenever I used to create an ad, and I used to create a landing page for it, I always saw a higher conversion, right? Yeah. And so I thought, hey, let's do this. Let's figure out if we can contextualize landing pages, right? And with AI, we could automate it as well, so I can do it for every ad. That's where we started as a company. We started January 2023. Raised capital from Excel and other other angels. In March, April 2023 we raised the route up around 1.8 mil, at 10 mil valuation. And beyond that, the way we beyond that, we started developing the product, I think, July 2023 we launched our first version that the key mistake we made there was that we focused on an ICP, which was D to C brands that I was coming there. So there's the bias, yeah, but I soon realized that nobody wants to pay in D to C because they are they are somehow being what is called. They are somehow being just pampered by Shopify ecosystem to get apps at $9 $19 $29 right? And so at that cost, it just doesn't make sense to work with them. Yeah. And so November, we realized this internet Lee, we started making the pivot March. We launched revised product for enterprises because we saw demand there, and I onboarded a company called a city fiber net, the third largest broadband player, right? So that was my client. In first two months, we created around 300 landing pages for them in less than, I think, two hours. So almost 25 26% incremental conversions, right? Went for lead, lead form fill to actual conversions. Okay? Then they went live with us, full of signup updates, and we went to around 12, 1500 pages. So during that process, like we have couple of other smaller players, but during that process, we realized how it works. And then August, September last year, we came out of beta, launched our alpha and launched our full product. We then onboarded star health insurance and KCT 500 sorry, Asian Paints as our clients, yeah, on POC. So they're going on POC right now. And then the idea is, like we started out reaching to us clients in November. So in terms of product journey, we started as more solving for scale, because we were doing similar stuff to your adult target, your Optimizely, Salesforce, experience personalization, Experience Manager, Monetate, etc. But what we did is these, these players required, like two to three internal employees to handle them. What we did is we automated, and we said, hey, we can do this. Ai workflows automatically, right? So that's where we started to scale. But we realized that hypothesis testing, hypothesis generation, continuously adapting pages, etc, is another Ask from marketers. So we started building small automations and now moving to more agents, where the agent can move into an ad account, understand the ad context and dynamically change the landing page based on where the user is coming from. And so that's the flow we have done it. It's very tough for enterprise to trust the agent continuously, so we put in so it's not true agent because they want some intervention, but if they don't want it, we can run it in completely as an agent as well, right? So that's what we have been doing, and that's, that's, that's exactly like what we pitch to our clients right now. The eventual goal is not to just do optimization, testing and performance, but also do Creation. But most creation, if you, if you are in value, you will know, like most creation is you do a prompt and then you create a website, or you do something I don't fundamentally like it because it just, it does not retain my brand guidelines. It does not my current landing page is looking like. So the way we are approaching this is, you give us a URL, any URL, rather than a template or a design. You give us a URL from Internet, and we will mimic it into your own design. And so that's why we are approaching our creation. It will take some time, like we are still testing it out. I think it's like three to six months away right but, but that eventual goal is to own the entire website. Yeah, own the entire app, completely from creation to optimization to performance monitoring, so that marketers does not have to go to developers, they don't have to go to product managers, they don't have to go to content. Everything can be done with our system. So post
so I'll walk you through my journey, and I'll also walk you through what we have been doing at fiber, yeah, I think the whole season on interfaces, I also believe in that the only difference, why we position more marketing is because the world revolves outcome based. They don't care about what pool tech you are building. Yeah, sometimes they do, but yeah, but eventually it's all about, like, if you have dynamic interfaces, what's the value out of it, right?

S Speaker 213:37that uncle. What role would a marketer play? Or let's, let's take a step back. And if I see this as a workflow, you have the data sources, which could be AdWords accounts or any other data repository. You connect to them, you you have a generate module which generates add users. You probably have a rag Sorry we don't generate for now, yeah, not today. But no. Like the way we are thinking is we are more towards interface website. And if we will do we will mostly go into

And like I've been saying, the companies that fixes and all, they're struggling because Facebook launch the same product, but websites, they're independent, right? There are 1000s of PMS is on which websites are in. So I think we'll do that. We might expand into app ecosystem, but we are not going into it. We still interfaces with a consumer.

So when you say, you personalize ads based on the context of the user, where the person is coming from and their demographics, then you have, anyway, sort of cohorted the user demographics into different, smaller cohorts, and then have had one personalized ad for each one of them. Is that how it? Is it, or is it very dynamic? Even beyond that,

For example, if you see a credit card ad, they might realize you're a VC, so you might travel a lot. If I see a credit card they might realize I'm a founder, so I might like need perks more. Yeah, you might see those two ads. And right now, most credit card company will take you the same landing page, right both of these ads. So when I was talking to Citibank, right now, they have 1000 such ads running, each going to the same landing page. Each ad has a different messaging, but the landing page has the same messaging.

S Speaker 116:50right now we do it is for Google AdWords. So Google AdWords, Google algorithm says that if your AdWords, your ad and your landing page are saying they will rank the ad better. AD is ranked better, your CPC goes down, and you get quality customer right now, marketers have been able to do ad and then AdWords and the ad syncing, because Google does it automatically with AI for them, but they are not able to do landing page. What we do is, for each of the advert, we create the land liquid, which talks about the network. So if you search Wi Fi near me versus broadband near me, both of them are exactly the same search. But when you come to the website, when you search Wi Fi near me, I will show Wi Fi as a keyword. When you do broadband near me, I'll show broadband as a key. Yeah, right. And we will change images, we'll change CTA, colors will change. We'll change headlines, we'll change navigation menu, we'll change footer. We can reduce the depth of the page and see the depth of waves. All of this is possible. Interesting.

S Speaker 119:13Yeah, so I don't think I'll be the right person for the architecture question, but I'll walk you through, like, how it works. We basically have a code, yeah, goes it the client, CMS, wherever the website is. And if you are familiar with website, there's like a Google Tag Manager, Google Analytics, Facebook, Excel, multiple code goes in Similarly, our code also goes in tech terms. It's called SDK, right? Like a JavaScript that gives us control of the website. Once we get the control of the website. We can do almost everything on that website. Now, in our back end, it works. It's basically connected to all the marketing tech stack. Now it starts from AD ecosystems. It starts from customer data platforms like your CDPs, where the customer data is. It could be CRM, it could be CMSs content, where content lies. Your analytics tools, from Google Analytics to Mixpanel, etc, yeah, all of these, we connect them in the backend, right? Like the client. Can do it by API client. Can do it with JPI, like however they want to do it. If we have out of the box, we directly connect. If we don't have out of the box, we will call it right, once this is connected, my AI, can basically read all the data, yeah, and the client can trigger up for personalization for a particular URL. It can trigger a journey based personalization in our dashboard on the back end side the when they trigger this, what happens is, basically, we use Cloud and open AI to train, the train the model on the client, tonality. So when the client connects with us, we basically go through their entire website, all the web pages, and also add content to understand how they write, what is their copy structure, what's the emotion, what is the tonality
Yeah, so I don't think I'll be the right person for the architecture question, but I'll walk you through, like, how it works.

S Speaker 221:16That's, that's very interesting, uncle. And is optimization from the market. Are you seeing optimization as the only goal for your clients? Or do you see some of them focusing on retention, some of them on engagement, and you can optimize based on that. Like I've

S Speaker 121:31is every so all like, Okay, so in terms of priority, most clients have the highest priority of increasing conversion, right? I mean, hey, we do want to increase conversion. The second highest is Net Promoter Score. Like, we want to improve our NPS, right? Yeah. And basically, NPs on website for clients translate into bounce rate. How much are you reducing the bounce rate, or how much time Additionally other client are average time spent on the website, right? Like, those are two big ones. Then third one is, and now these two conversion and NPS could be for your new customer or could be for a retention customer. We saw, right again, depends on the client, but we are also seeing like they are using email marketing. So in terms of email marketing, if you get an email from a customer from a brand, you get Hey, Priyesh, blah, blah, blah, z and this, but we'll click on it. You go to a website which is, again, generic with us. A test case we are doing is, in case of renewal, you don't have to log in again, you go to the website. You can just in one click Checkout, right? Like those kind of stuff. So all of these use cases is what we are working

S Speaker 222:40with, interesting, interesting. So what's the plan now, Uncle, do you? Are you thinking about raising another round? Is there a milestone you want to hit before that? And how do you look at the timelines going in?

S Speaker 122:56Yeah, so we are, we are figuring out in raising another round, the idea is, what we realized, because we have been talking to Fortune, 500 and larger companies, we need to shift our base from India to us, like we are right now, because of RBI regression, we are India headquartered company to us. We raised one point 8,000,002 years back, and we have another we have around 650 K left in our account, which we are on 14 months runway for us. So, so we do want to raise some capital, because now we want to accelerate. We have proven the value with three large companies in India. We want to accelerate, like sales in us, get clients in us, onboarded with us. So, so, yeah. So we'll be raising, we do want that. We do want somebody who basically can add value, especially in GTM for us and and that's the plan. So in fact, I'm meeting like around eight partners, like eight venture funds, yeah, we are with closely aligned to what we are trying to build, and see, like, if it works with any one of them. And then place some capital there, yeah, like, our grades are not too high in terms of capital, just, we just need some acceleration capital, right? Yeah,
Yeah, so we are, we are figuring out in raising another round, the idea is, what we realized, because we have been talking to Fortune, 500 and larger companies, we need to shift our base from India to us, like we are right now, because of RBI regression, we are India headquartered company to us. We raised one point 8,000,002 years back, and we have another we have around 650 K left in our account, which we are on 14 months runway for us.
