S Speaker 14:12the way that I usually like to structure these interviews is to kind of spend the first 15 to 20 minutes asking about your case and then flip the interview around to see if you have any questions for me. Any questions for me, sure. The first question that I had was, I noticed that you split your analysis into kind of four sections. Um, you looked at the workplace, worker time slot and duration. After taking a look at like the pay rate analysis. And curious why you organized your diet that way? Sure.

S Speaker 24:44So Bobby, when I went through the case study, I tried to understand that a shift, particular shift, is claimed by a worker, which is created by a workplace, and is created and is claimed by the worker, or it is unclaimed by the worker. And I also saw, saw that each row is a shift offer which is either being claimed or unclaimed by particular worker. And there are multiple shift offers for particular shift. Also, I saw that there are different order variables, such as payment, paper, rate, time, slot, duration. These are other variables that acts as a designing factor for a shift being claimed or unclaimed, right? So I try to analyze the trends, relationships and correlation to check how, how these factors are driving as a deciding factor for these workers to claim or not. That's how I broke it down into four different parameters of relationship trends coming to payment rate like we saw that, I saw that after analysis, I saw there is a clear cut, $3 average pay difference between a claim shift and unclaimed ship. That means payment is a major factor, deciding factor for a worker. It's actually it acts as a motivating factor for a worker to claim it or not claim it. Also, if we see the range, there's also a similar difference in the maximum value of this claim manager and shape shift and claim shift in terms of payment. That means the range is also varying in the same way, right and but the correlation is not that strong. It's approx 0.2 that means it's directly related, but not a very strong point, not that very big point. Second Coming to time slot. We saw that am slot shifts has the least just

S Speaker 27:16Not exactly. I don't think that decreases the correlation? Because, I mean, we took a unique shift, and, you know, we tried to check. I mean, no, I don't think so. What

7:53Okay, in terms of
S Speaker 27:57tangible or, I mean, you are, I'm sorry. I just want to make it clear you are asking the data centers. So other than paper it, I think time slot is what that matters. And of the shift is what that matters. What could also matter is the workplace ID, as in workplace is familiar. If the workplace is familiar with the worker, they might consider it. Or in terms of commute, if that workplace is easier to come easier in terms of commute, they might consider it. These are few factors that I think is important, other than pay. That

9:04Uh, yeah, actually,
S Speaker 29:07I had filtered it based on time slot in my further analysis. I yeah, I filtered it based on workplace cohorts, as in the number of shifts at a workplace post. And also I had cohorted the workers as in how many shifts that they claim, in general, to check how this correlation works.

S Speaker 19:35But in your time slot analysis, yeah, I found it interesting that you looked at kind of shift volume, you looked at claim rate, first lot and then variability in pay, but you didn't repeat the analysis from above with comparing the pay rate of unclaimed versus claimed shift in the same slot. And I was curious, why? Oh,

10:10of course. No worries. Okay.

of course. No worries. Okay.
S Speaker 210:18Okay, yeah, actually, when I did time slot analysis, I majorly I had taught at average pay also here in terms of time slots, like I did in the case or the above case. What majorly was my point of highlight here is that how the demand and supply is in the market and how the workers preferences changes in terms of time slots. So payment, if we see the payment, there is very any of these slots. It's approx $26 on average. So these are, these are not, I think this is not a very there's not very much variation in the average space. So this can be very, a very big deciding factor. What can be deciding factor is, what is the total shifts that are being posted by the workplace and how the workers are giving it. So if you see NOC shift has the least focus shifts, but that is the most key ones, if we increase the demand of this NOC shifts from the workplace side, and if we go for some personalized shift matching for the worker side.

S Speaker 111:15So just to go back to the point about personalized matching, yeah, how would you implement

S Speaker 211:22them? Sure. So a problem state that workers are not gaming the ships, because it can be because they are able to see their preferred shifts, or it can be because of various other reasons, maybe because of commute, maybe because of the workplace environment is not good for or maybe they want some non monetary benefits from the work plan that preferring. So we need to do some user analysis. User need to check user needs and their pain points for that quality, we have a little set of quantitative data for better understanding. We need to do interviews and surveys. Once we have those what would
them? Sure.

S Speaker 213:06what is based on historical data. We can check what is their preferred shifts, what type of job shifts they are looking for, AM, PM, noc, what is the maximum duration of the shifts that they are looking for things like that. And once we have this data, we can go for push notification for that them on the app if, in case, they are looking for, say, pm slots. And if any urgent pm slots, we can show it on their notification, urgent work required with some extra pay or incentive, whatever. So that kind of implementation we can go with, we can also go

S Speaker 113:47sorting. I think there's an interesting point that you make where you mentioned that increasing the pay for KNOCK shifts would be a suggestion that you would have.

S Speaker 214:08When you did the analysis shift are the most K ones a process is exposed now that means that people are willing to go for those night shifts. Also, interestingly, when I mapped it with the duration and days, as in when this when shift is going to start, I saw that most of these NOC shifts are claimed over the weekends. That means people are working, willing to work. Maybe these are full time or part time workers who are willing to work on these shifts, and once, if we try to more for their work, there are higher chances of these shifts being filled. Because that's already on a higher note, and we fit a little bit in terms of incentive. I think we can make it a better chance of it. There's a bit

S Speaker 115:03why book those shifts more than pm shifts, which are getting low.

15:09I'm sorry I did not get you. Oh, sorry,
I'm sorry I did not get you. Oh, sorry,
I'm sorry I did not get you. Oh, sorry,

S Speaker 115:12why? Why book? Why incentivize the NOC shift above the am or pm shifts that have claim rate right

S Speaker 215:29because because of two factors, first, am shift has already The as in time taken between shift start to shift claim. So that means people are active for am ships. They are they are getting the highest pay also, out of all the three ships, they're getting the highest pay also. And they are very much interactive. So they are very interactive. They interactive, as in they there's a very small lease on the time from ship start to shift claim. So they are very much engaged, and they are also getting the highest pay,
because because of two factors, first, am shift has already The as in time taken between shift start to shift claim. So that means people are active for am ships.

S Speaker 216:21a lower than me. That's That's right, I incentivized for NOC shift because they have already a higher claim. If so that I think is easier to increase, rather than am shifts or pm shifts. Because for am shifts, we already saw that people are engaging. That is very engaging for people at all, they are also getting high still, they are not claiming it. That means there are some other presence that they focus on, right? But for NFC shifts, we see that claim is highest, even with the small is even with the lowest pay, price can be a motivating factor for them. So
a lower than me. That's That's right, I incentivized for NOC shift because they have already a higher claim. If so that I think is easier to increase, rather than am shifts or pm shifts.

S Speaker 117:04how do you know the remaining factor for that?
how do you know the remaining factor for that?
how do you know the remaining factor for that?
how do you know the remaining factor for that?
S Speaker 217:08Yeah, although have a limited data set, I made a
Yeah, although have a limited data set, I made a
Yeah, although have a limited data set, I made a
Yeah, although have a limited data set, I made a
17:17fair idea that the
17:21lowest pay they are claiming it and
lowest pay they are claiming it and
lowest pay they are claiming it and
lowest pay they are claiming it and
S Speaker 217:26yes, also they are mostly claiming it over the weekends. That means people are engaged on it. That's either I could get over the from the limited data set. But yeah, of course, I need some more qualitative data to validate my assumptions.
yes, also they are mostly claiming it over the weekends. That means people are engaged on it. That's either I could get over the from the limited data set. But yeah, of course, I need some more qualitative data to validate my assumptions.

18:06yeah, like I said,
S Speaker 318:17Yeah, same. The

S Speaker 319:02or PM? When I
S Speaker 219:09did the analysis, I saw that average pay is more or less in the same spectrum as it's one, $2 everything amongst all the shifts. So I think we were great. I only had
did the analysis, I saw that average pay is more or less in the same spectrum as it's one, $2 everything amongst all the shifts. So I think we were great. I only had

did the analysis, I saw that average pay is more or less in the same spectrum as it's one, $2 everything amongst all the shifts. So I think we were great. I only had
S Speaker 119:27one more question. So when you did your worker wise analysis, I was curious how you came up with the two types of worker, one that WORKED maybe six to 20 shifts, and those that work higher number of shifts. How do you
one more question. So when you did your worker wise analysis, I was curious how you came up with the two types of worker, one that WORKED maybe six to 20 shifts, and those that work higher number of shifts. How do you
one more question. So when you did your worker wise analysis, I was curious how you came up with the two types of worker, one that WORKED maybe six to 20 shifts, and those that work higher number of shifts. How do you
one more question. So when you did your worker wise analysis, I was curious how you came up with the two types of worker, one that WORKED maybe six to 20 shifts, and those that work higher number of shifts. How do you
19:43make that grouping in the data?
make that grouping in the data?
make that grouping in the data?
make that grouping in the data?
S Speaker 219:47Yeah, sure. So. I tried to do this cohorting based on threshold values. Threshold cohorting as I did not take equal size of this because of the outliers. So I decided to cohort in such a way that it has some measurable data set in under each cohort, and that make that makes a sense out of it, although, if we see very high kind of workers are still towards some outliers, because there are only two workers. So my process was to make it accessible and a deciding factor here for how did you
Yeah, sure. So. I tried to do this cohorting based on threshold values. Threshold cohorting as I did not take equal size of this because of the outliers.

20:36choose the specific numbers for each

S Speaker 320:40threshold? Yeah, zero to 26. To 20 shifts,
threshold? Yeah, zero to 26. To 20 shifts,
threshold? Yeah, zero to 26. To 20 shifts,
threshold? Yeah, zero to 26. To 20 shifts,
20:48zero to various six to 20. Okay,
zero to various six to 20. Okay,
zero to various six to 20. Okay,
zero to various six to 20. Okay,
S Speaker 220:56zero because I wanted to check the K patterns, and I did not take it from zero to 20, because that would have come across learned, as per the data the worker size and that I did not have, I would not have a proper demarcation in medium and high kind of workers. So I decided to COVID in such a way that it makes more sense, and we have a very niche Mark segment to focus on, we get a better understanding of which where we should focus on. Why does
zero because I wanted to check the K patterns, and I did not take it from zero to 20, because that would have come across learned, as per the data the worker size and that I did not have, I would not have a proper demarcation in medium and high kind of workers.

S Speaker 121:24it make more sense and to have, like low workers from three to 20 shifts or 15 shifts even? Why does this cohorting make more sense? I'm just kind of curious how you made that decision. Yeah. Okay.
it make more sense and to have, like low workers from three to 20 shifts or 15 shifts even? Why does this cohorting make more sense? I'm just kind of curious how you made that decision. Yeah. Okay.

S Speaker 221:43Three to five. I mean, I exactly could not have gone that data set. However, that point i i thought this is the better way of doing is that that data set make that better sense for me? Yeah,
Three to five. I mean, I exactly could not have gone that data set. However, that point i i thought this is the better way of doing is that that data set make that better sense for me? Yeah,

21:57um, got it. And then
22:01for workers that
S Speaker 122:05number of claims at the same workplace, I'm curious what conclusion that you drew from the distribution there between one claim, two claims and three claims. Okay, yeah,
number of claims at the same workplace, I'm curious what conclusion that you drew from the distribution there between one claim, two claims and three claims. Okay, yeah,
number of claims at the same workplace, I'm curious what conclusion that you drew from the distribution there between one claim, two claims and three claims. Okay, yeah,
number of claims at the same workplace, I'm curious what conclusion that you drew from the distribution there between one claim, two claims and three claims. Okay, yeah,
22:21yes. When I did worker wise
yes. When I did worker wise
yes. When I did worker wise
yes. When I did worker wise
S Speaker 222:28when I did worker wise analysis, I saw that 80 across 80% of the workers are inactive, and only 12% of workers are engaged in shift claiming so. That is a very interesting fact. And second, I saw that whosoever are claiming are that more than 50% of workers are returning to the same place, same workplace as in, they are booking multiple ships to the same workplace. So that shows a strong workplace loyalty. I I think some intangible factors are are more dominant here, other than payment or time slot for these

S Speaker 123:24great. So I I just wanted to open up any time that we had left for you to ask any questions that you had about clipboard.
great. So I I just wanted to open up any time that we had left for you to ask any questions that you had about clipboard.
great. So I I just wanted to open up any time that we had left for you to ask any questions that you had about clipboard.
great. So I I just wanted to open up any time that we had left for you to ask any questions that you had about clipboard.
S Speaker 223:34Okay, question, yeah, I had a question. I I saw that clipboard health is expanding into other verticals, as in, school that I rented office, so I was just curious to know, as in, if it is not related to healthcare, then what is the final goal of clay board as in, why are we going into those verticals?
Okay, question, yeah, I had a question. I I saw that clipboard health is expanding into other verticals, as in, school that I rented office, so I was just curious to know, as in, if it is not related to healthcare, then what is the final goal of clay board as in, why are we going into those verticals?

S Speaker 123:56Yeah, I think it's to be a single source of providing labor hours for folks in any industry that may it's pretty exciting watching some of the colleagues work in New verticals like education, has been really cool to see how that expands over time.
Yeah, I think it's to be a single source of providing labor hours for folks in any industry that may it's pretty exciting watching some of the colleagues work in New verticals like education, has been really cool to see how that expands over time.

S Speaker 224:17Sure, so I'm going to expand in other sectors as well over the time. Yeah, hopefully. Oh, great, great. Thank you. That answered my question. Yeah,
Sure, so I'm going to expand in other sectors as well over the time. Yeah, hopefully. Oh, great, great. Thank you. That answered my question. Yeah,
