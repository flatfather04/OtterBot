S Speaker 20:30if things go well beyond what we've got in place with JP Morgan, and we license PayPal, we license Capital One, and these are all discussions we're having, yeah, and we start to see, like, you know, really massive uptake, I think, you know, that's obviously what our goal is. So it's just, we don't have those deals in place at the moment, so we, we, we laid out like how we thought it might play out, so that you can see, like, you know, with any luck, right? It's obviously much bigger business, than 50 million revenue within two years.

S Speaker 22:42Yeah, we have a big, like, big fat license agreement. Actually, we have two. Like, the way the deal structured is we have basically a license agreement for JP Morgan on the consumer side, where we give them all the biometrics to manage a JP Morgan consumer platform that ultimately will be tied into the Chase Mobile Banking app, where they've got like, 60 million people, and then we have a license agreement on the merchant side where they're embedding our biometric switch into, you know, things like this, that get attached to payment terminals and kiosks, and that's for their Merchant Services team to sell to merchants. So the way JP Morgan works, it's the biggest issuing bank and the biggest merchant bank, acquiring bank, so they have both sides in the marketplace. So we have two different license agreement different license agreements. And in those license agreements, like the license agreement on the consumer side, is where most of the money gets paid to us. And, you know, there's some pretty significant numbers in there that are basically almost guarantees, actually, and so they won't say we're going to get this many transactions, this many merchants, anything like that. But there's things like, they need to distribute the pop ID, pay by bank product, to, you know, a certain percentage of their merchant base by such and such date. Or they have to pay like, a license fee, like a minimum license fee to us and, okay, stuff like that. So I, like my I believe there's, like, substantial downside protection in this deal because of these license agreements, and that if they don't perform, they got to pay us money. But there's nothing that, like guarantees these numbers that are projected. So the one thing that's guaranteed is, if they don't hit certain numbers, that we get some license fees that are minimums,

S Speaker 14:58Absolutely, I get that totally down the line. We would like to do one of those calls for sure. I'll also loop in versa for that. Yes, yeah.
Absolutely, I get that totally down the line. We would like to do one of those calls for sure. I'll also loop in versa for that. Yes, yeah.
Absolutely, I get that totally down the line. We would like to do one of those calls for sure. I'll also loop in versa for that. Yes, yeah.
Absolutely, I get that totally down the line. We would like to do one of those calls for sure. I'll also loop in versa for that. Yes, yeah.
S Speaker 35:06So that is, that's actually the kind of the fundamental top line that drives a lot of the model. So the way the model is structured is, and I'm sure John pointed to you the structure of the deal with JPMC, but they are licensing the platform. They're going to be going out and selling the platform. But we also have the right to sell the platform to other players, and in particular, we're actually selling access to the JPMC platform, and when we do that, we have a right to price it the way we want. So the model is structured. Is line six is basically, hey, here's what JPMC said they could do with their own merchants. And then, to keep things clean, I just did a very simple assumption, oh, I think as pop ID, I can sell another 50% of that those two streams end up being, and the way they're referred to in the model is, you know, jpm I think I did JPMC GPV and transactions, and then non JPMC GPV and transactions. And as John probably explained in the deal, there's a different pricing associated with each one, but that a high level is how the revenue gets computed. And then I can go through that in more detail, if you'd like. I can

S Speaker 26:58out of Yeah, yeah. On our side, some of it is done contracted steak and shake Whataburger, and then a lot of it is like real discussions going on where you might even be able to have reference calls. McDonald's is one, for example, yum is another one where, you know, hopefully got pilot pilots lined up to get started. So, so, yeah, we we did that for coverage ventures. We went through and basically our direct customers that we're selling to. No problem there. It's just the JP Morgan ones are the ones we don't, can't really, yep,
out of Yeah, yeah. On our side, some of it is done contracted steak and shake Whataburger, and then a lot of it is like real discussions going on where you might even be able to have reference calls.

S Speaker 17:30that's fair. Got it. Got it. So how would you like to do it? Sean, would you want me to sort of point to the questions I have on the model right now, or do you want me to give it? Yeah, whatever
that's fair. Got it. Got it. So how would you like to do it? Sean, would you want me to sort of point to the questions I have on the model right now, or do you want me to give it? Yeah, whatever
that's fair. Got it. Got it. So how would you like to do it? Sean, would you want me to sort of point to the questions I have on the model right now, or do you want me to give it? Yeah, whatever

S Speaker 17:54think let's just close on the high level overview, and then I can go through some of my questions. I don't think I have many, so wouldn't be a long discussion. Yeah, okay,
think let's just close on the high level overview, and then I can go through some of my questions. I don't think I have many, so wouldn't be a long discussion. Yeah, okay,

think let's just close on the high level overview, and then I can go through some of my questions. I don't think I have many, so wouldn't be a long discussion. Yeah, okay,
S Speaker 38:02so I don't think I you have the model pulled up. Yes, okay, so occasionally I'll just refer to rough line, okay, yeah, so line five or line six is basically, that's the input that we got from j, P and C.
so I don't think I you have the model pulled up. Yes, okay, so occasionally I'll just refer to rough line, okay, yeah, so line five or line six is basically, that's the input that we got from j, P and C.

S Speaker 28:17Just make sure you understand biometric check in versus biometric checkout. Biometric check in is when someone shows up and says, I want to see my loyalty and see my favorite orders on the kiosk or at the drive through or the counter and loyalty earn loyalty points. It's all about loyalty and kind of an interactive personalized recommendation on the food or retail experience, and then check out is the payment got it. Those are basically the two different basically every implementation we have there's a check in and the checkout and Jake and Morgan is telling the same thing.

S Speaker 18:51And what do you need a check in for every checkout? Or do you envision there would be some checkouts without check in as well?
And what do you need a check in for every checkout? Or do you envision there would be some checkouts without check in as well?
And what do you need a check in for every checkout? Or do you envision there would be some checkouts without check in as well?
And what do you need a check in for every checkout? Or do you envision there would be some checkouts without check in as well?
S Speaker 28:58There's quite a bit of check ins without checkout, where people like are comfortable doing biometric loyalty with the face or palm scan now, but they still want to use Apple Pay, yeah, and then at the time, I think they'll convert. And there's also some people that just don't get loyalty at all. They're just doing biometric checkout. So we've got, we So, so the way the pricing structure works with you can coordinate. It can happen just biometric check in, and we get paid for that. It can have a biometric check in and check out. We can pay for that, or it can just be biometric checkout. No check in, we get paid for that,

No check in, we get paid for that,
S Speaker 19:26right? Yeah. And for simplicity, I think the model for now assumes that there's one check in for every checkout. That's right, got it?
right? Yeah. And for simplicity, I think the model for now assumes that there's one check in for every checkout. That's right, got it?
right? Yeah. And for simplicity, I think the model for now assumes that there's one check in for every checkout. That's right, got it?
right? Yeah. And for simplicity, I think the model for now assumes that there's one check in for every checkout. That's right, got it?
S Speaker 39:33So what JPMC wanted to do was there are two check ins to every checkout. Oh, that's right, yeah, okay, was that came from them based on their they said was their consumer research, gotcha. And that actually shows up anything that's an input is kind of blue box, and that shows up in line eight, alright? So again, you have the top line, you have that ratio, and then I'll go a lot faster through some of this other stuff, and then the Hey, we think we can sell about 50% of what JPMC sells for their own platform. So now I have a sense for how many checkouts are going on. To figure out the amount of money flowing through the system, I have to know the average transaction size. That's it. Line 20. You can see it increases as we start to go after different segments. So kind of begins with QSR, but then as you push towards grocery, that average transaction size goes up. The next section I'll just give you at the very high level, JPMC. Wanted to highlight that some industries will adopt sooner. So they provided this data. What it basically all does is kind of multiply together on a weighted average basis, will and lays out a distinction between consumers that sign up with cards versus consumers that sign up in Ach, John, you've explained kind of the difference and where our primary source of revenue is. Or should I run through that? Maybe

You can see it increases as we start to go after different segments. So kind of begins with QSR, but then as you push towards grocery, that average transaction size goes up. The next section I'll just give you at the very high level, JPMC. Wanted to highlight that some industries will adopt sooner. So they provided this data. What it basically all does is kind of multiply together on a weighted average basis, will and lays out a distinction between consumers that sign up with cards versus consumers that sign up in Ach, John, you've explained kind of the difference and where our primary source of revenue is. Or should I run through that? Maybe
So what JPMC wanted to do was there are two check ins to every checkout. Oh, that's right, yeah, okay, was that came from them based on their they said was their consumer research, gotcha. And that actually shows up anything that's an input is kind of blue box, and that shows up in line eight, alright? So again, you have the top line, you have that ratio, and then I'll go a lot faster through some of this other stuff, and then the Hey, we think we can sell about 50% of what JPMC sells for their own platform. So now I have a sense for how many checkouts are going on. To figure out the amount of money flowing through the system, I have to know the average transaction size. That's it. Line 20.

S Speaker 211:11so. Ach, pay by bank. You know, we're moving money outside the card network. That's a big part of our partnership with JP Morgan, it's a big part of our vision. Do you have background, sort of, in how that works, versus the card network, debit, credit cards? I

S Speaker 111:25did a brief website, so I have some overview. Yes. Okay.

did a brief website, so I have some overview. Yes. Okay.
S Speaker 211:29I mean, the basic idea is, you know, sort of, in the world today, governments like India, Brazil have shown that you can build the entire payment system around pay by bank. So an idiot, GPI, Brazil, it's pics. And so even in the us all, the infrastructure is now in place to do that. You have a banking tool. Now there's even real time services for doing real time payments. And so our view is that, and this is goes back to several years, the biometric authentication is the very best way to do a pay by bank. It's better than a QR code for various reasons, and it allows us to set up a really robust dispute resolution system, because we have the timestamp picture, so there's really no such thing as fraud, and we can administer that dispute resolution system at very low cost compared to the card network. So as a result of all that, the cost to move money is like few pennies. Dispute Resolution is very low cost. We can charge the merchants lower than they're paying for debit and credit cards, and that incentivizes the merchants to promote. So Whataburger, we charge like 1% for pay by paying they're paying Chase, like two and a half percent for debit credit card transactions, and so they're really motivated to get all their consumers that would use a debit card to link their pay by bank. We can't go after credit really, because those people want points and but there's $31 billion of debit card fees in things like QSR and coffee. And so these brands, Chipotle and Whataburger and McDonald's, they see an opportunity to do pay by bank, authenticated with biometric for low fraud, and save, like, huge amounts of money and free cash flow because the fees are lower. Got

Got
S Speaker 213:33just, yeah, and guess what? We're doing it so, so, like in the Middle East, they've licensed, like the UAE central bank has licensed a lot of the technology for pay by bank from India, and so it's called idiot payments. And they have two rails, domestic rails they've built around. So about India, j1 and Ani. So we're licensing the central bank to link that India UPI system to biometrics for face upon so our vision, our vision. So, like, what I've seen is a lot of these governments around the world, they're saying, it's amazing India did this, and it supports a billion and a half people, and so we should be able to do this in our country. They got complete independence from Visa MasterCard. So if the US ever sanctions any of these countries, their economy doesn't get stifled by Visa MasterCard leaving. And they've saved their they've saved all this money internally in their domestic economy, from fees paid to Visa MasterCard. So these governments are saying, Let's go replicate what India has done, and let's kick out Visa MasterCard. We can, we can do it just like that, and let's license their technology. But let's make it even better, because the QR code is not a great way to authenticate, right? It's slow. It takes time, you know, maybe there's some pride. So let's take the UPI technology and combine it with the pop ID technology, and that's like a whole business model for us, like just, I'm like, knocking on doors of central banks, Kuwait, UAE, Bahrain, Qatar. I mean, pretty much every government in the world is looking at what India and Brazil have done, and we think we can go to license the biometric system to all of them. So that's like, in our upside scenario, in that model, there's a lot of that. There's a great deal of license fees, basis points. We don't have to do a whole lot, right? It's software. So I would love to let me put something together about that, like in a deck form that goes along with that second model. Because that is, I mean, I talk to Caleb about this all the time. In fact, she's introducing us. She's at a conference in Florida today. She's introducing us to a couple customers about this kind of thing. So I think
just, yeah, and guess what?

15:30that's a that's a big opportunity, actually. So I will, I'll get you something.
that's a that's a big opportunity, actually. So I will, I'll get you something.
that's a that's a big opportunity, actually. So I will, I'll get you something.
that's a that's a big opportunity, actually. So I will, I'll get you something.
S Speaker 115:33Yeah, I agree, absolutely, John, if it's not a lot of effort, but yeah, for sure. Okay,
Yeah, I agree, absolutely, John, if it's not a lot of effort, but yeah, for sure. Okay,
Yeah, I agree, absolutely, John, if it's not a lot of effort, but yeah, for sure. Okay,
Yeah, I agree, absolutely, John, if it's not a lot of effort, but yeah, for sure. Okay,
15:40so again, that lays out the
so again, that lays out the
so again, that lays out the
so again, that lays out the
S Speaker 315:43the split between card and ACH. As John mentioned, the R revenue for ACH is substantially higher than it is for card with JP Morgan. So that breakdown that's on 47 to 48 is pretty important. And do you want to mention and to mention anything about kind of the data that we're seeing for Ach, now, or did you already run through I have,
the split between card and ACH. As John mentioned, the R revenue for ACH is substantially higher than it is for card with JP Morgan. So that breakdown that's on 47 to 48 is pretty important. And do you want to mention and to mention anything about kind of the data that we're seeing for Ach, now, or did you already run through I have,
the split between card and ACH. As John mentioned, the R revenue for ACH is substantially higher than it is for card with JP Morgan. So that breakdown that's on 47 to 48 is pretty important.

And do you want to mention and to mention anything about kind of the data that we're seeing for Ach, now, or did you already run through I have,
16:07I mean, it just is really good. So we've got, like, sorry, I don't really know.
I mean, it just is really good. So we've got, like, sorry, I don't really know.
I mean, it just is really good. So we've got, like, sorry, I don't really know.
I mean, it just is really good. So we've got, like, sorry, I don't really know.
16:12I do actually know stuff, yeah.
I do actually know stuff, yeah.
I do actually know stuff, yeah.
I do actually know stuff, yeah.
S Speaker 216:15So like, like, Whataburger, we, I can say we control the city, but Whataburger, it's like 35% of the GMV, the biometric payments are pay by bank. And so whatever whataburgers focus there is to go launch, sort of launching the platform on every Whataburger next to a college campus. So they started at Texas A and M and L. She so that, because their idea is like the college student not only comfortable with biometrics, but used to using that iframe the link their bank account for like Robin Hood and event things like that. So so we actually everybody you know, one of the reasons why visa is investing in this deal, if you talk to visa ventures, is that they saw that data. They're worried about pay by bank disrupting their business. They bought Tink, which is connection system for pay by bank that competes with plaid, which is what we currently use. And so they've asked us to link team to our pay by bank product and to co branded visa. So our pay by bank product is actually going to be co branded with Visa, believe it or not. And that's great because it'll inspire a lot of consumer trust and really drive Visa's reach. And I think Visa's because if we have success with that, they're going to be in a position be in a position to, you know, to acquire the company, right? That's really what they're looking at. Absolutely,
So like, like, Whataburger, we, I can say we control the city, but Whataburger, it's like 35% of the GMV, the biometric payments are pay by bank.

Absolutely,
S Speaker 317:30So all those numbers kind of boiled down into like 60 to 68 which is the total number of biometric card transactions and biometric ACH transactions broken down by whether they're jpm brought that customer on board or we brought the customer on board. And again, the reason I do that is because we have different pricing negotiated with jpm. In both those cases, we could go through the pricing. It's like a It's a tiered based pricing structure for JPMC. The one that drives the bulk of the revenue in this model is actually just the ACH transactions. Check in is important, but it's primarily the ACH transactions that are driving it. And in the model, we are charging the merchant 1% for that. In the case of when it's us selling it, we get that full 1% when it's JPMC selling it, I think they get 30% they get 30% of that back. That's really the primary revenue source in the model. And then John kind of mentioned, and we can go through this later, margins on pch, super high. The actual variable costs to move money. We'll switch to where it's about eight cents right now, independent of the size of the transaction, and over time it'll go to two cents or even one cent. So it's you end up with something where you're charging 1% of the transaction and you're just paying a few pennies to move it around. And then, you know the variable costs would be things like support, which is, I think, a lot easier than credit cards, because you generally have a picture of people, and then there's not too much else. So you know, the the cost associated with the recognition are relatively fixed. So it's a really great business.
So all those numbers kind of boiled down into like 60 to 68 which is the total number of biometric card transactions and biometric ACH transactions broken down by whether they're jpm brought that customer on board or we brought the customer on board.

And again, the reason I do that is because we have different pricing negotiated with jpm. In both those cases, we could go through the pricing. It's like a It's a tiered based pricing structure for JPMC. The one that drives the bulk of the revenue in this model is actually just the ACH transactions. Check in is important, but it's primarily the ACH transactions that are driving it. And in the model, we are charging the merchant 1% for that. In the case of when it's us selling it, we get that full 1% when it's JPMC selling it, I think they get 30% they get 30% of that back. That's really the primary revenue source in the model. And then John kind of mentioned, and we can go through this later, margins on pch, super high. The actual variable costs to move money. We'll switch to where it's about eight cents right now, independent of the size of the transaction, and over time it'll go to two cents or even one cent. So it's you end up with something where you're charging 1% of the transaction and you're just paying a few pennies to move it around. And then, you know the variable costs would be things like support, which is, I think, a lot easier than credit cards, because you generally have a picture of people, and then there's not too much else. So you know, the the cost associated with the recognition are relatively fixed. So it's a really great business.

S Speaker 319:42now. We can go through the margin structure in detail, but basically that cost to move money around is so low, the gross margin ends up being exceptionally high, and there's very few other costs associated with

S Speaker 120:47And I would like to separate this service cost out of it, just to get a pure view of gross margin. Where is that included in the model, so that I can work it out on the background later.

S Speaker 321:03Sure the actual the calculations associated with this graph. I did everything for the graphs at the bottom. So it would be, I think it was called ACH margin analysis. It starts at line, three, 354, got it, yeah. Obviously, if you click on any of those, it'll kind of show you where, where everything comes from. I but I did include, yeah, it's more of a variable margin because I did include the support costs associated with it. Got

it, yeah, that's, that's
it, yeah, that's, that's
it, yeah, that's, that's
S Speaker 321:42see. So then I have the pricing, which we the key component we talked about for check ins, which does end up being, you know, an important but less significant component of the revenue. We charge three cents per check in when it's a merchant that we sell, and then jpm pays this sliding scale.
see. So then I have the pricing, which we the key component we talked about for check ins, which does end up being, you know, an important but less significant component of the revenue. We charge three cents per check in when it's a merchant that we sell, and then jpm pays this sliding scale.

S Speaker 322:08yeah, that's why it's that really funky. Long with the Yeah, exactly. That's like, but for the merchant, this is a great deal, right? Like, if I can start tracking who my customer is, if I can push the right products on them, generally, you see, for a customer that engages heavily with loyalty you send, you tend to see about a 10 to 15% increase in annual revenue that you get out of that customer, even just presenting people with, Hey, here's what you ordered Last time, that pretty consistently will bump up your revenue by about the average ticket size, by about 4%
yeah, that's why it's that really funky. Long with the Yeah, exactly. That's like, but for the merchant, this is a great deal, right?

S Speaker 122:47and is there, let's say some of the current customers who are paying something around the same ballpark for check ins, is, do you have That comparative figure right now, yeah,

And then it's actually some cases, the customer says we don't want to pay per check and we want to pay like, a monthly fee, like McDonald's has said we want to pay $10 a month for unlimited amounts of check ins. We're negotiating that we'll probably do it because it's McDonald's, and it gives us, like, millions of users, and okay, there's obviously risk, some risk, that if you have every single person going to McDonald's doing a check in, and you're only collecting $10 a month, you may not be making money depending on the cost.

S Speaker 324:03it variable cost is very low, yeah, yeah, that's true. There's no movement of money, so it's really just the amortization of whatever the cost of the recognition is, yeah, and I have that model, but you know, again, that continues to commoditize, and then just kind of our infrastructure type costs. But, yeah, we can. We can run through all that, but so that takes care of the model down to about line 127, yeah. So those are the revenues from operations, the previous revenues from operations associated with jpm sees platform, so both them selling customers, customers using it, merchants using it. And then this moves into, okay, this was our first stab at the licensing revenue, and it's actually based on another model that we worked on with Dubai holding that lays out a plan for growth in the Middle East and the associated fees that they would pay COVID That's at this level.

S Speaker 330:42processing, just some rough estimates on what that cost. Sure. Yeah, we can. So the biometric software licensing, this one reflects our paravision contract. The thing, well, you may want to talk about other investors who are interested. For me when I'm not CFO, I'm more on the math side of things. All the stuff is commoditizing, you know, as the all the tools for making neural nets get better. Almost all the systems are neural net based. All you really need is the source of data. And you can immediately with a large named data source, you can, you can create your own model. So Qualcomm is probably gonna have their own models. Qualcomm has their own liveness model,

31:25their own hashing model we

their own hashing model we
S Speaker 331:26can use, yeah, but I made an assumption that our current, the current price that we pay is, I think, 250 a year, and then I had it growing as we scaled. This kind of makes the assumption that, you know, out a couple years, it's good, that's what we agreed to. I think it was a three year deal beyond that, as we get into massive scale, I'm assuming some level of commoditization, but maybe not even that much. So that's one of the costs. The other thing that we do is liveness. Liveness is ensuring that the image that you're taking is actually of a live person, someone's not holding up their phone, holding up an image, or some crazy 3d mass, which nobody actually does, but that kind of stuff. That's the current price that's in there is actually a little higher than what we're paying right now, and I just kind of ramp it up over time to be conservative. Ultimately, all this stuff, I think, will become even more commoditized. Right now. It's all neural net. It will go to multi frame, which is you can do on the edge. And then I think there's a very good chance that your need to do liveness goes down. If you were able to demonstrate that the user that who you think is trying to do the transaction, has their mobile phone with them, because that's an additional check. Yeah. So this, I think, is an overestimate of how much live this will cost, but those, those are the two big kind of technology costs I mentioned that there's a slight delay between when I call for money for the merchant when I get it from the consumer, as we grow that creates working capital within the system, because I'm paying merchants out prior to when I get money in. I model that as half a day in the system, and you can kind of see what that is. So working capital, if you shut down the whole system, you'll get it all back, but we would have to finance it with capital. Revenue sharing is a pretty important element of our model. I don't know if you want to talk about this. I'll just,
can use, yeah, but I made an assumption that our current, the current price that we pay is, I think, 250 a year, and then I had it growing as we scaled.

S Speaker 335:53That would be the ideal way to do it. These the numbers in line 28 to 34 these were numbers I got from JPMC that told me to use in a very specific way. They are not merchant locations. They're actually brands. So I did not use them up above, because it wasn't clear to me how I would use them. So what I did is I went back and forth with JPMC on what the average transaction size should be for your questions, the right one, but that one's that was the data that they gave me. Got it. So I hope in their heads they tied them together. And I'm sure they did. They have, I mean, they have visions of, like, I think we're, well, yeah, so we're working with them on a demo for a kind of high seller, very high end

purses and luggage, yeah? So,
purses and luggage, yeah? So,
S Speaker 237:00like, they're going to like LVMH, they're going to like LVMH. So they do, they do a lot of the processing for those high end fashion retailers. So they so, so their view is, like, you know, actually, there's a role for biometric premium to play, just like security fraud and like purses and and choose Yeah, for them, that

S Speaker 337:17check in is yes is also big, but that primary growth when I've had discussions with them, is basically the move from QSR to grocery store, where the average transaction size is much larger, and then to Yeah, I would say that that's actually the biggest driver.

S Speaker 338:11to assumption that, I apologize that should read due to assumption all. JPMC, yeah, this was like, I had to make sure that their math worked out. There's another line in the model that says percent of

S Speaker 238:27so here's a here's the reason why this exists. Because in the contract, when there's there's a check in and a biometric card transaction, we just get paid for the check in. We don't get paid on the card transaction if there's a check in and a biometric ACH transaction, we get paid for the check in plus the ACH transaction. So it's a
so here's a here's the reason why this exists. Because in the contract, when there's there's a check in and a biometric card transaction, we just get paid for the check in. We don't get paid on the card transaction if there's a check in and a biometric ACH transaction, we get paid for the check in plus the ACH transaction. So it's a

39:05let me write that down,
let me write that down,
let me write that down,
let me write that down,
S Speaker 339:08all right, but this should be due to the assumption that all JPMC, yeah, because this would be limited to JPMC cards, yeah, so we would have only gotten paid with the for the check in on that right?
all right, but this should be due to the assumption that all JPMC, yeah, because this would be limited to JPMC cards, yeah, so we would have only gotten paid with the for the check in on that right?

S Speaker 139:25Got it so row 157 where you calculate resulting total pop ID users. That's a summation of additional check in users and result in pop ID checkout users. How's that working? I'm just a bit confused that.

S Speaker 339:42Yeah, so this was JPMC. They said they wanted to have the ratio of check ins to check out the two. So basically, I, I don't remember why I started with I can go back to where it is. But basically this is just adding in that that second set of users. So you have one set of users who, for every single transaction, is doing a check in and a check out, and then you have one set of users of equal volume that is doing just the check in, yeah. And so that's reflected in that 153 and 156
Yeah, so this was JPMC. They said they wanted to have the ratio of check ins to check out the two. So basically, I, I don't remember why I started with I can go back to where it is. But basically this is just adding in that that second set of users.

And so that's reflected in that 153 and 156
S Speaker 340:38okay, yeah, these were based on what we actually see in our own system. So let me pull some data out of our system, yeah, for the average checkouts, and then you can kind of see where it is. You're
okay, yeah, these were based on what we actually see in our own system. So let me pull some data out of our system, yeah, for the average checkouts, and then you can kind of see where it is. You're

S Speaker 240:55saying, like, like, show show me a Whataburger, what the usage is. Show me deli time with us? Yeah, we've got, yeah, well, I can just send that the deck I went through with, yeah,
saying, like, like, show show me a Whataburger, what the usage is. Show me deli time with us? Yeah, we've got, yeah, well, I can just send that the deck I went through with, yeah,

S Speaker 341:07yeah, yes. So John, I'll send you, send you something on that, and then yeah, the idea with the growth was that as we're present in more locations, consumers will use the service first. So obviously, same thing, same thing. Same with Apple Pay and other services like that, got it.
yeah, yes. So John, I'll send you, send you something on that, and then yeah, the idea with the growth was that as we're present in more locations, consumers will use the service first. So obviously, same thing, same thing. Same with Apple Pay and other services like that, got it.

S Speaker 141:30What's What's your assumption on the churn 10% figure? Do you think it's conservative? Do you think it's aggressive? Where do you think it stands right now? So what
What's What's your assumption on the churn 10% figure? Do you think it's conservative? Do you think it's aggressive? Where do you think it stands right now? So what
What's What's your assumption on the churn 10% figure? Do you think it's conservative? Do you think it's aggressive? Where do you think it stands right now? So what
What's What's your assumption on the churn 10% figure? Do you think it's conservative? Do you think it's aggressive? Where do you think it stands right now? So what
S Speaker 341:40we have, we don't actually see that. You know, it's like one of those services where people just stop using it, right? So I believe that this is a reasonable figure that'll go down. I looked at the current churn a while back. One of the challenges for us is the most of the areas where we've deployed are colleges. So you typically lose, you actually lose a little bit more. You lose about 30% of the students every year. I could
we have, we don't actually see that. You know, it's like one of those services where people just stop using it, right? So I believe that this is a reasonable figure that'll go down.

You lose about 30% of the students every year. I could
42:12do the stuff for
S Speaker 342:16I went through an analysis around some of our local businesses, and I remember coming up with the number, I can definitely pull that together for you, because what we do see is, once people start using it, as long as they're in the area, they do tend to keep using it.

42:54so I have these clear,
so I have these clear,
so I have these clear,
so I have these clear,
43:00yeah, on row 224,
S Speaker 143:04so I see the difference between 193 and 1.43 which is the half day lack in the money being transferred, and hence the requirement for working capital. How have you calculated both of those numbers? I see five plus three plus two by seven, something like that. Is there a logic behind it?
so I see the difference between 193 and 1.43 which is the half day lack in the money being transferred, and hence the requirement for working capital. How have you calculated both of those numbers? I see five plus three plus two by seven, something like that. Is there a logic behind it?

S Speaker 343:24There was, let's see if I can remember it. It is so you can't do ACH transactions over the weekend. I remember why I do that. It's really simple. So I should be able to remember it. And then the other one is just that plus point five. Let's
There was, let's see if I can remember it. It is so you can't do ACH transactions over the weekend. I remember why I do that. It's really simple. So I should be able to remember it. And then the other one is just that plus point five. Let's

S Speaker 143:44see if I can remember. That's where I think, I think the working capital is in, the most big, the biggest driver in the financial model. So
see if I can remember. That's where I think, I think the working capital is in, the most big, the biggest driver in the financial model. So
see if I can remember. That's where I think, I think the working capital is in, the most big, the biggest driver in the financial model. So
see if I can remember. That's where I think, I think the working capital is in, the most big, the biggest driver in the financial model. So
43:52the other we're actually able
the other we're actually able
the other we're actually able
the other we're actually able
S Speaker 243:54to it goes away. So what's gonna like wherever this is going in the next couple years is real time pull the funds and real time push So, and that's why we think ultimately this pay by bank grant will beat the card network, because the money will actually, it'll get pulled out of my Wells Fargo account and push to the Whataburger Chase account in the same moment. And all that infrastructure being put in place now, with fed now, and RTP and all this stuff. So that's where so eventually there's really no risk, there's no balance checks, there's no there's no delay settlement. It's all real time. And that's probably three years where that is everywhere. It's well on its way, but, uh, but in the meet. So in the meantime, I don't know how material that because
to it goes away. So what's gonna like wherever this is going in the next couple years is real time pull the funds and real time push So, and that's why we think ultimately this pay by bank grant will beat the card network, because the money will actually, it'll get pulled out of my Wells Fargo account and push to the Whataburger Chase account in the same moment.

S Speaker 344:33you're saying it's that material. The other thing is, we're using different ACH payment windows with Walla now, so they're little, they've been great. So I can actually redo this, but that half day where that half day delay is a little bit lower now and then I can hop I mean, I'm happy to send you the windows that we're able to access. The big one becomes like on a Friday night if I need to pay someone, the last window, I want to say is at 5pm or 7pm and then I can't get the money from the consumer until Monday. And somehow that was reflected in there. But I don't, I don't remember, but that rough half day kind of cash to cash cycle that was about right? And then I can go back and just redo the calculation. I could send it to you. But, you know, as John said, the idea is that this will go away. Ultimately, the windows are going to open up over the weekend. But yeah, it's I'm happy to add on to that.
