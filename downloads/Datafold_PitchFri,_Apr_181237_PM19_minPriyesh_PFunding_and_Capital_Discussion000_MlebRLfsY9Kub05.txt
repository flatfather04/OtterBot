S Speaker 20:06So, right now, we have most of this 4 million already built by combination of insiders and strategics. We also discussed with any A that we can, you know, get additional, additional money. Like, if someone says, you know, there's a G coming in and saying, like, hey, we want to invest more, we would take it. So I think we could fit one to 2 million additional capital in the rounds, if

S Speaker 23:14One is, most enterprises have their data locked in on legacy platforms like Oracle, Microsoft, SAP, Teradata, Informatica, you name it. And if you are doing analytics and all the data pipelines on those platforms, you're probably struggling to even pull together dashboards, and you're definitely not shipping AI on that stack. They have to move to snowflake Databricks, modern platforms. The second challenge is, even if you are on snowflake or Databricks, it is likely that the workflow of your team is very slow, because it takes a lot to write code, to test code, to deploy, monitor and fix it,

S Speaker 24:07before I go into use cases, just quick sense of our business. So currently, 3 million Arr, 2.4x year over year over time, customers and one of the most exciting things that's happening right now, we're seeing massive acceleration of our ASPs and compression of sales cycles thanks to our new AI products,

S Speaker 14:50okay, start shipping in 2020 Yes. Okay, got it correct. I thought some earlier years you were building the product. Okay, so you start shipping then and then. So, I guess the last few quarters have been decent and then and then, it seems you're, you think you can ramp to, I guess last two quarters, when you're thinking would be a big two quarters for you, is that based on this,

S Speaker 25:27this year? Yes, yeah, we're seeing a lot of isolation from our US to the use cases. And the pipeline is growing like we've historically already done, like FTX pipeline, big scholarship pipeline. Right now we've seen like success or next quarter. So,

S Speaker 26:18let's talk about the use cases. So I talked about data platform migration. So this is an example of a project that historically could take 10s of 1000s of hours. And the story goes like this, but you're an enterprise, let's say in your so ran, most of your data is in these really legacy, super expensive or take platforms you try to move to small group data bricks. To do the migration, you have to do two things. You have to, one, move the data, which is easy, like can be done in a week, not a problem in 2025 and then you have to move code, code that is, we're talking about like millions of lines of code written and running on these legacy systems that are highly specific to that architecture. You can't just take Teradata code and make it on a snow plate. You have to translate it, refactor it, repackage it, optimize it, and that historically, in a process done by consultants over a timeline of two to 10 years at enterprise scale. So extremely laborious, extremely expensive, extremely slow, we developed a product to automate over 90% of that with AI. So we, like I said, we done with data when we handle everything around movement of the code, modernization of the workflows in the code. What powers that is an AI agent that leverages large language models to build the semantic graph of the API code base so I understand how the data flows and translate every object in that graph, and very importantly, validated or any migration, is absolutely critical that if I'm moving something to Snowflake, snowflake produces the same numbers as the lake is a system. So the validation is a super critical and current step in the agent and with the feedback loop. So if we see any kind of discrepancies, we get back in the translation layer, and it self heals, basically. So in a nutshell, it does exactly what a human data engineer would do, but it does it at scale. Yeah.

S Speaker 19:40not, right? It's actually data migration, but they pivoted from like, just purely being a data migration place. The underlying platform is still data migration, but is

S Speaker 110:07But I wonder if you're looking at the same website. It's actually most of it is not right. Most of it is painting data which is stored in all these different data lakes, and then converting them to like usable apps now.
But I wonder if you're looking at the same website. It's actually most of it is not right. Most of it is painting data which is stored in all these different data lakes, and then converting them to like usable apps now.

10:26And yeah. And then this seems
And yeah. And then this seems
And yeah. And then this seems
And yeah. And then this seems
S Speaker 210:27different. Are we talking about these guys? Company? Yeah, the other one, yeah, well, it says Build multi step data transformations and record time. Minisco, yeah. I think it's a completely different use case than what we're doing. Okay, I don't see this competitive at all. Yeah. All right,
different. Are we talking about these guys? Company? Yeah, the other one, yeah, well, it says Build multi step data transformations and record time. Minisco, yeah. I think it's a completely different use case than what we're doing. Okay, I don't see this competitive at all. Yeah. All right,

S Speaker 110:55yeah. So, the idea again, so So with guys like, so your customers, like, for example. What does this mean? Do with this?
yeah. So, the idea again, so So with guys like, so your customers, like, for example. What does this mean? Do with this?
yeah. So, the idea again, so So with guys like, so your customers, like, for example. What does this mean? Do with this?
yeah. So, the idea again, so So with guys like, so your customers, like, for example. What does this mean? Do with this?
S Speaker 211:05Well, I'll talk so a specific example. So every is a 10,000 person company UK, one of the leading logistics companies. They have a stack of SAP HANA talent Oracle or analytics, and they want to move to Databricks. They have a time timeline, because if they don't move within this year, they will be up for renewal, which will cost them multiple millions of dollars. So they bought data fold, and data fold converts their objects, all their code, from all these legacy systems to Databricks, code with automatic validation. They started with just SAP HANA, and once we delivered phase one of that project, they now are doubling down. So they just bought twice as much of data fold to also migrate talent. So we take, you know, lots and lots of code, migrate into new system, then they cancel the old system. That's their landing use case. Got it. So that is the platform growing use case for us. Sales cycles, big checks, wealth of traction. We have more demand than we can service right now, because the value proposition is like, do migrations in weeks, not years at a fraction of the cost, okay,

and and glad you're raising the round right now, because I were you
12:59running out of money?
running out of money?
running out of money?
running out of money?
S Speaker 213:01Correct? Yes, well, that plus also, the reason why we're running out of money is because we are actively expanding our teams because we stumbled upon a incredibly lucrative use case, so we continue investing in our team and expanding it so we can actually accelerate the product
Correct? Yes, well, that plus also, the reason why we're running out of money is because we are actively expanding our teams because we stumbled upon a incredibly lucrative use case, so we continue investing in our team and expanding it so we can actually accelerate the product

13:43your burn is. How big is a team?
your burn is. How big is a team?

13:4730 people, 30 better. Yeah,
30 people, 30 better. Yeah,
30 people, 30 better. Yeah,
30 people, 30 better. Yeah,
S Speaker 215:15Moody's is a different example, actually. So Moody's adopted data fold without a migration inside, just for the platform features, because they are shipping AI themselves, and they needed to accelerate testing and ensure that they can maintain high velocity without sacrificing quality, and they're using us as part of their AI stock across our site users. So we started just with one group, and then slide into multiple groups, so it's like your day to day automation use case,
Moody's is a different example, actually. So Moody's adopted data fold without a migration inside, just for the platform features, because they are shipping AI themselves, and they needed to accelerate testing and ensure that they can maintain high velocity without sacrificing quality, and they're using us as part of their AI stock across our site users.

S Speaker 115:50and then. So where does, like, Where does your tool plug in here?
and then. So where does, like, Where does your tool plug in here?
and then. So where does, like, Where does your tool plug in here?
and then. So where does, like, Where does your tool plug in here?
S Speaker 116:52and then you how do you charge your customers? Is it based on the amount of data that you move, or is that like a per,
and then you how do you charge your customers? Is it based on the amount of data that you move, or is that like a per,

17:03like, yearly economy?
like, yearly economy?

like, yearly economy?
S Speaker 217:04Yeah, we don't move any data. We never touch the data itself. We always operate on the code
Yeah, we don't move any data. We never touch the data itself. We always operate on the code
Yeah, we don't move any data. We never touch the data itself. We always operate on the code
Yeah, we don't move any data. We never touch the data itself. We always operate on the code
17:11and then so how do you charge the customers?
and then so how do you charge the customers?
and then so how do you charge the customers?
and then so how do you charge the customers?
S Speaker 217:15We charge them based on the complexity of their environment. So let's say if you have a data warehouse, and data warehouse has 500 tables with a legacy warehouse like an Oracle, 500 tables, 600 procedures, we would charge you X amount per object to migrate that once you're in a modern, modern infrastructure, we would charge you pretty much the same structure so per object that you are Moving, that we are monitoring or testing, I believe

S Speaker 217:56So as the complexity of the customers environment grows and always does, because people are building all the new stuff all the time, we can charge them more. So got it.

S Speaker 118:20I think for us it might be like this stage would be hard for us. So I think the strategic relevance work with us is limited

18:33in this space. And then
in this space. And then
in this space. And then
in this space. And then
S Speaker 118:36I would say, like, since this is a transition round, would be hard for us to join this stage, given the strategic relevance is also limited with us. So but thanks for the update. Yeah, absolutely.

S Speaker 119:01go after similar spaces. It's just that I think they have to pivot to like it's the underlying tech is the same. Pivot to building apps.

19:14Interesting, okay,
19:21cool, I saw same consumer slides.
cool, I saw same consumer slides.
cool, I saw same consumer slides.
cool, I saw same consumer slides.
S Speaker 219:26Okay, cool, I'll take a closer look. Yeah, Look,
Okay, cool, I'll take a closer look. Yeah, Look,
Okay, cool, I'll take a closer look. Yeah, Look,
Okay, cool, I'll take a closer look. Yeah, Look,
19:31but anyways, thanks.
S Speaker 219:35Yeah, absolutely. Thanks to Charlotte Thanks Brad. RIGHT.
