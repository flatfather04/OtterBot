S Speaker 10:00Went into the whole red teaming side for agents, which is, I will, I will marry the outcome to the inputs, and I'll close the loop and ensure the quality of AI is great, right? And I probed him on it as to, what is your long term vision, right? What he's saying is, I want to become like a horizontal player, but when I dig into the technical chops as to, how will you get there? He struggled. He didn't have answers to how He'll crack it right. Same thing with I talked to both from virtual AI. She's super technical. We went deep into AI guardrails and red teaming. And when I asked her that, hey, for agents, you will need a network level product, because agents are all going to be protocol based, right? Yeah. She's like, Oh yeah, in the future, we will think about it, right? Because today, they are so focused on red teaming and guardrails, which for them, is a great entry point. But my my point was still the, you know, the same which is these whole model companies, the talent they have, the kind of problem statement they're working for, they don't have access to these models in an embedded AI use case. They don't have access to those data points in a third party app, which is like a whisper or a context.

S Speaker 21:19They all need some kind of API deployment model, SDK, you know, someone to deploy them. It's okay. You can enforce but the third party application and that kind of model doesn't work. Yeah, doesn't work.

S Speaker 11:34So I'm saying that for for them, there's, like, a slightly different DNA of the company. It's a very research heavy DNA. I'll tell you the company that we talked to this morning. Very solid guy. You will say that the bank, he sold the company to Palo Alto. He's going after the governance problem. Very smart, right? And his point was, the market is still, you know, catching up on the whole governance point, right? Which is enterprises. That's what enterprises need today, and you can build security on top. So to your point, witness does have benchmarks for their model, model, guard against the model, armor, right? I will be having a conversation with the CTO to actually understand where. Let's make sure you get that especially so I will Exactly, yeah. So that is one thing that I'm definitely doing, because that's the security angle. But I still continue to believe that a lot of these building an enterprise grade, scale company, changing focus of your company from being focused on a model security to a horizontal platform. It's easier said than done in a space like security. So for me, you know, then we can't invest in anything in security. Anybody can do everything, right? But still, you know, the caspys existed, the sassy is existed, the dlps existed, right? Because not everybody was able to solve it. That's why they have so many categories and so many companies, right? So, so, so I will get those benchmarks, but just in terms of a thesis. Point of view, I still feel like the governance first thesis has a lot of value today, because the enterprises are adopting it faster the land and expand. Once you are horizontally into an enterprise, it's easier to build security on it versus you go into an AI team.

S Speaker 23:18But what's inside a governance bucket? Like, what would you categorize that I actually would see, like being able to capture data, see and capture data, and be able to make a judgment,

S Speaker 13:30no, so, even able to protect it. So, so understanding the content. Well, okay,
no, so, even able to protect it. So, so understanding the content. Well, okay,

no, so, even able to protect it. So, so understanding the content. Well, okay,
S Speaker 23:39so the tech, there's a implementation model question to it, and I think witness check that box, yeah, it's more like, okay, data and logic. In order for you to make the protection,
so the tech, there's a implementation model question to it, and I think witness check that box, yeah, it's more like, okay, data and logic. In order for you to make the protection,

3:57what categories company are you
what categories company are you
what categories company are you
what categories company are you
S Speaker 14:00referring so? So I would say that that's why I put in an overlap here, because the you mentioned that you have to secure it, right? Ultimately, everybody wants protection, right? Yeah, but you can't do protection unless you have visibility or observer, right? Yeah, who has the broadest observability and who has the capacity to build a broadest security stack on time. The guys who can go into as a horizontal layer, they have access to who's using what, and then you can layer in security which is what witness is doing. And that's why I like their approach, because they can then head on multiple layers of context, data, you know, prompt injection, jailbreaking multiple things that they can build on top of it. Yeah, right. So, so, so I, I think it's, there's an overlap between so it's not just governance. The reason I'm saying governance is that's the entry point, but there is a security angle to it, yeah?
referring so? So I would say that that's why I put in an overlap here, because the you mentioned that you have to secure it, right? Ultimately, everybody wants protection, right?

S Speaker 24:54So, governance, security, you know, actually a lot of times there's too much overlap, because right, people will actually say, you know, like the primary interaction all these people will call it

5:12I guess you know my point of view
I guess you know my point of view

S Speaker 25:15is okay, so the most important dimensions are, one is being able to observe information and the other ones being able to make judgment,

right? So if you look at the
right? So if you look at the
right? So if you look at the
S Speaker 25:30observability piece of being able to observe information, I think I saw they said a lot of customers, they actually start with that product with them, right? I think we need to poke a little bit there on the scalability of their observability platform.

S Speaker 15:47So the companies we talked to, like the company with this morning, foundation, capital, at the seed, the scale that they have. The largest scale they have is 800 employees. Deployment. These guys worked at Ball world

S Speaker 26:02in terms of the number tokens are able to
in terms of the number tokens are able to
in terms of the number tokens are able to
in terms of the number tokens are able to
S Speaker 16:05Yes, sir. So the thing is, if you look at the number of employees, that's one indication of how many tokens they can process, like 800 employees versus 160 1000 employees. If you even take one token per minute or one token per hour, you can do the math and figure out the skill is, I think the
Yes, sir. So the thing is, if you look at the number of employees, that's one indication of how many tokens they can process, like 800 employees versus 160 1000 employees. If you even take one token per minute or one token per hour, you can do the math and figure out the skill is, I think the

S Speaker 26:26maybe just directly ask them, like, what's, what's the largest token scale?
maybe just directly ask them, like, what's, what's the largest token scale?
maybe just directly ask them, like, what's, what's the largest token scale?
maybe just directly ask them, like, what's, what's the largest token scale?
S Speaker 16:29I can ask, I can ask, I can answer. So I'll definitely take that as a note. Yeah, okay.
I can ask, I can ask, I can answer. So I'll definitely take that as a note. Yeah, okay.
I can ask, I can ask, I can answer. So I'll definitely take that as a note. Yeah, okay.
I can ask, I can ask, I can answer. So I'll definitely take that as a note. Yeah, okay.
S Speaker 26:37I used to not think that could be a bottleneck, yeah, but then there's a brain trust I reach out a couple of weeks ago, yeah, and it keeps saying the biggest difference between them is that everyone else's observability platform fails right when it gets to larger scale, right? And the largest frontier lab companies are working with brain trust on observability, and it didn't even start as a really company. Because, okay, yeah, they said the reason they ever do this because they have some kind of special way building up the data platform, right? Okay, so therefore they can, they can handle the true scale that's needed for those companies, right, right? So, so, you know, may not, may not matter for average enterprise companies, yeah, but let's, let's poke it a little bit to see, okay, how okay in terms of their observability, right? Why is their observability winning against others?
I used to not think that could be a bottleneck, yeah, but then there's a brain trust I reach out a couple of weeks ago, yeah, and it keeps saying the biggest difference between them is that everyone else's observability platform fails right when it gets to larger scale, right?

S Speaker 17:36So observability, again, is that so I looked at brain trust, right? So brain trust would be observability like Galileo or Fiddler AI. The observability that witness would do is employee level observability, which is what applications is Albert using, and how many prompts Has he made

8:27But you know, it will be good to maybe
But you know, it will be good to maybe
But you know, it will be good to maybe
But you know, it will be good to maybe
S Speaker 28:32in terms of how deep each one go, yeah. And what, why is? Why is witness AI doing better observability than others. Well, I guess one of the hardest reasons, because they go down to the network level, right?
in terms of how deep each one go, yeah. And what, why is? Why is witness AI doing better observability than others. Well, I guess one of the hardest reasons, because they go down to the network level, right?

8:44So they see different things
So they see different things
So they see different things
So they see different things
S Speaker 18:47than others, right? Yeah, but they're more on the employee usage side. Was, yes, yeah, was it? Was this just an application deep and going into, you know, the metrics and stuff. But what I'll do is I'll come up, come up, come up, with my understanding of how I see that space, but I completely get your point. So I'll ask about the scale of witness, like, how the depth
than others, right? Yeah, but they're more on the employee usage side. Was, yes, yeah, was it? Was this just an application deep and going into, you know, the metrics and stuff.

S Speaker 29:08that just just layer out, like it will mean different things when observer steps there to get to versus others, when
