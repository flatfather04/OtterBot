S Speaker 21:25Yep, that sounds good. I may wait for five minutes at some point,
Yep, that sounds good. I may wait for five minutes at some point,
Yep, that sounds good. I may wait for five minutes at some point,
Yep, that sounds good. I may wait for five minutes at some point,
S Speaker 32:01okay? And that's you asked about the 2021, revenue,
okay? And that's you asked about the 2021, revenue,
okay? And that's you asked about the 2021, revenue,
okay? And that's you asked about the 2021, revenue,
S Speaker 12:05the revenue, and is the revenue? Just because the model has gross revenue as you hear and net revenue? Are you able to see the screen? Yeah. And so I don't know what was in the last when we did the deal, were we looking at net or gross? So that may be another that that can be one distinction here. So we had management projections of revenue from let's look at 23 because we have 23 onwards. Here, we had 24 point 8 million as management projections in my email to you. So

2:48I think maybe it was
S Speaker 12:51read. Do you remember if that was gross or net that you guys were using last time?
read. Do you remember if that was gross or net that you guys were using last time?
read. Do you remember if that was gross or net that you guys were using last time?
read. Do you remember if that was gross or net that you guys were using last time?
2:56Yeah. So this is 2023
Yeah. So this is 2023
Yeah. So this is 2023
Yeah. So this is 2023
S Speaker 23:03that was our projection. You're saying projected revenue, that would be gross revenue. That would have been the projection on gross revenue. I mean, the projection on premium written was 40 million for 2023
that was our projection. You're saying projected revenue, that would be gross revenue. That would have been the projection on gross revenue. I mean, the projection on premium written was 40 million for 2023
that was our projection. You're saying projected revenue, that would be gross revenue. That would have been the projection on gross revenue. I mean, the projection on premium written was 40 million for 2023

3:17this is an old model you're showing, right? So, this
this is an old model you're showing, right? So, this
this is an old model you're showing, right? So, this
this is an old model you're showing, right? So, this
3:19is your new model. This is what you sent us.
is your new model. This is what you sent us.
is your new model. This is what you sent us.
is your new model. This is what you sent us.
3:24Yep, I see the title
S Speaker 23:25that makes sense. So 2023, total. Yeah, we ended at 40.1 41 million, basically, yeah, so that was actual.
that makes sense. So 2023, total. Yeah, we ended at 40.1 41 million, basically, yeah, so that was actual.
that makes sense. So 2023, total. Yeah, we ended at 40.1 41 million, basically, yeah, so that was actual.
that makes sense. So 2023, total. Yeah, we ended at 40.1 41 million, basically, yeah, so that was actual.
S Speaker 13:34So you're saying we should compare the 10 million to the old projections. Okay, got it the gross revenue. And this is the GWP line, correct? Yes, yeah. Okay, great. So Paul, if possible, if you can send us the 2122 numbers, yeah, yeah. And if you have them handy, now that's fine, but that will be that'll be good to know. And then read when we talked about the multiples, we talked about multiples on GWP, and some of the companies, public companies, have multiples, obviously, on revenue. So
So you're saying we should compare the 10 million to the old projections. Okay, got it the gross revenue. And this is the GWP line, correct? Yes, yeah. Okay, great.

4:10would that be a net
S Speaker 24:15Sure? You know, I'm not sure. Generally, I'm aware of what like private mgas are, you know, privately held MGA is kind of trade out in m&a activity. There are a couple examples, like Palomar insurance and Kinsale and others that have good comps. I have a few. Let me pull it up. We've had a few bankers do some analysis over the over the last couple years.

S Speaker 14:42Just send it to us. Read. We'll just review that. Okay, why don't you send it to us? Is Yes, okay, I think this is good. Now, what is the cash in the bank today?
Just send it to us. Read. We'll just review that. Okay, why don't you send it to us? Is Yes, okay, I think this is good. Now, what is the cash in the bank today?

S Speaker 34:53Cash in the bank today is one second,
Cash in the bank today is one second,
Cash in the bank today is one second,
Cash in the bank today is one second,
S Speaker 35:02$5.6 million as of the last reconcili amount. So that's November 30, and the estimate for December year end would be about $3.8 million
$5.6 million as of the last reconcili amount. So that's November 30, and the estimate for December year end would be about $3.8 million
$5.6 million as of the last reconcili amount. So that's November 30, and the estimate for December year end would be about $3.8 million

S Speaker 15:15okay? And is there venture debt still on the books? And how much is that amount?
okay? And is there venture debt still on the books? And how much is that amount?
okay? And is there venture debt still on the books? And how much is that amount?
okay? And is there venture debt still on the books? And how much is that amount?
5:21It is on the books? Yeah, okay.
It is on the books? Yeah, okay.
It is on the books? Yeah, okay.
It is on the books? Yeah, okay.
S Speaker 15:36$437 okay, and how much do we still have left that we can draw from.
$437 okay, and how much do we still have left that we can draw from.
$437 okay, and how much do we still have left that we can draw from.
$437 okay, and how much do we still have left that we can draw from.
S Speaker 35:41So available debt on that facility, we are tapped out at 4.5
So available debt on that facility, we are tapped out at 4.5
So available debt on that facility, we are tapped out at 4.5
So available debt on that facility, we are tapped out at 4.5
5:49so we have no ability to borrow more. Oh,
so we have no ability to borrow more. Oh,
so we have no ability to borrow more. Oh,
so we have no ability to borrow more. Oh,
S Speaker 16:19easier, yeah, because might be easier for you to move it around. Yep.
easier, yeah, because might be easier for you to move it around. Yep.
easier, yeah, because might be easier for you to move it around. Yep.
easier, yeah, because might be easier for you to move it around. Yep.
6:30Can you see it now? Paul,
Can you see it now? Paul,
Can you see it now? Paul,
Can you see it now? Paul,
S Speaker 36:33between screens, I can see, yeah. I can see it
between screens, I can see, yeah. I can see it
between screens, I can see, yeah. I can see it
between screens, I can see, yeah. I can see it
S Speaker 46:39also. Before we start, if you can give us a overview of how the model works, what is the flow of the model? I think it's a very well done model, and thanks a lot for doing the scenario analysis for us. But we'd love to see what are the base assumptions here, and which that feeds into what?

S Speaker 36:56Okay, yeah, so, so the core component is the actual model tab. So if you look at,
Okay, yeah, so, so the core component is the actual model tab. So if you look at,
Okay, yeah, so, so the core component is the actual model tab. So if you look at,
Okay, yeah, so, so the core component is the actual model tab. So if you look at,
7:06you know, it's just literally
you know, it's just literally
you know, it's just literally
you know, it's just literally
S Speaker 37:09labeled model, right? Basically what this is, it kind of sets it up in a more complicated way than I think is necessary. But it basically has a holding company, a statutory reporting entity, and, you know, a bunch of different entities. So that's that's kind of the flow of it. But I mean, the key assumptions really are sort of a few things. The first and most important key assumption, from an mga perspective, is our provisional commission. So if you go to the consolidated assumptions tab, you'll see that in the top left corner, we could it's titled seating commission, but what it is is really here a provisional commission, and that's the amount that we receive as we write business from the reinsurance companies through the fronting company. And so that's kind of the economic engine that drives it. And so when we sell a policy, say it's $100 policy, what we'll ultimately wind up getting is 20% of that will come to us in commission, and from that commission amount is what we use to pay everything else. Now it's a little bit more complicated than that, but not much, because we have a captive that takes 5% of the risk, so 5% of that doesn't come to us, because it actually goes to the cap that we wouldn't pay ourselves. Commission. So, but that's the mechanics. That's the biggest portion of the economics that flow into the into the company, is that provisional commission. Now the provisional commission is truly provisional, meaning that we have a target. And so if you look at 2024 you'll see a 21% there, yeah, but that gets adjusted based on loss ratio performance. And so there's kind of a corridor, and I can send in the information at mechanically how this works, but basically it works like this, if we achieve a loss ratio of 62% then we get the full 21% commission. That's the target loss ratio. If we do better, we can get more commission up to 25.5 if we do worse, we can lose commission points all the way down to 16. So the it's all indexed off the target. And so that's mechanically how it works, and that's where the biggest flow of funds comes. Because ultimately, you know, we're an mga so therefore the commission revenue that we get from the insurance company and reinsurers is kind of the biggest economic engine for us. Does that make sense?

Does that make sense?
S Speaker 49:30Got it so for me to sort of evaluate the revenue from premium written that would be 21% of the premium return minus the 5% of capital participation that will go out. Yes, understood. And on this tab, Paul, again, there are consolidated financial scenario results and change from base model. Can you explain the difference between the three of them? Sure, yeah. Also focus
Got it so for me to sort of evaluate the revenue from premium written that would be 21% of the premium return minus the 5% of capital participation that will go out. Yes, understood. And on this tab, Paul, again, there are consolidated financial scenario results and change from base model. Can you explain the difference between the three of them? Sure, yeah. Also focus

9:56on which one we should look at.
on which one we should look at.
on which one we should look at.
on which one we should look at.
S Speaker 110:00Yeah. Because in the interest of time, let's just say which one to follow. Yeah.
Yeah. Because in the interest of time, let's just say which one to follow. Yeah.
Yeah. Because in the interest of time, let's just say which one to follow. Yeah.
Yeah. Because in the interest of time, let's just say which one to follow. Yeah.
S Speaker 310:04So this is designed to give you the ability to kind of toggle some assumptions and see what happens. So the consolidated in the left corner, left part, starting at the 11, that's that's the results of the model. And so if you go into the yellow section and modify some of those numbers, the scenario results will pop out, and then the change from base model just shows you the difference between the two. So the one to focus on for sure is the one that's directly below the yellow portion. That's just the consolidated model
So this is designed to give you the ability to kind of toggle some assumptions and see what happens. So the consolidated in the left corner, left part, starting at the 11, that's that's the results of the model.

S Speaker 110:39one disruption. Which tab are we in right now? I'm going back to my because this is hard to see for me. Priyesh, what time? Consolidated
one disruption. Which tab are we in right now? I'm going back to my because this is hard to see for me. Priyesh, what time? Consolidated

S Speaker 410:47assumptions, tab, the first tab for sure. Okay, thanks,
assumptions, tab, the first tab for sure. Okay, thanks,
assumptions, tab, the first tab for sure. Okay, thanks,
assumptions, tab, the first tab for sure. Okay, thanks,
S Speaker 310:54yeah, if you just want to test it out, if you go to so how about D for, for type in minus n, that'll change the assumptions for the premiums. So it just gives you a way to think about like, Okay, if this happened, what would it look like in the model? But it never changes the consolidated base model Understood,
yeah, if you just want to test it out, if you go to so how about D for, for type in minus n, that'll change the assumptions for the premiums.

S Speaker 111:24Paul, just to clarify, sorry, sorry, to interrupt you. Priyesh, just to clarify, the model to look at, for what you presented to for this particular round of funding is the model at the top, that

11:41which, which which rows would that be?
which, which which rows would that be?
which, which which rows would that be?
which, which which rows would that be?
S Speaker 311:45So you should the one you have highlighted is the output of the model, but it looks like this model, yeah, is indexed as like a previous model that we had a couple months prior.
So you should the one you have highlighted is the output of the model, but it looks like this model, yeah, is indexed as like a previous model that we had a couple months prior.
So you should the one you have highlighted is the output of the model, but it looks like this model, yeah, is indexed as like a previous model that we had a couple months prior.

S Speaker 212:02Yeah, we've updated it. Last I sent out the same model that we had sent, but we haven't updated. I mean, it's this exact same model, but we've just as we've gone for the annual planning process and everything we've we've made some adjustments as a I mean, we're always, constantly making adjustments, but I think we've published a new version of it, like in the last few days I call

S Speaker 112:26okay. So just on this one, though, is the current base model, the model to look at as what you are driving towards for this series. So

S Speaker 312:38let me ask you a question real quick. I can give you an answer to that. What do you guys, as you work with this model? Have you made any changes to the assumption that it does not look like you? Have at all?
let me ask you a question real quick. I can give you an answer to that. What do you guys, as you work with this model? Have you made any changes to the assumption that it does not look like you? Have at all?

S Speaker 412:50I have made a few changes. Paul seven included the CDC amount 20 million here, and then a few changes on the cash runway.

S Speaker 313:00Okay. Yeah. So then I would say that the scenario results, so go over to the right, starting in column I through N, you know, that is the results the scenarios that incorporates all of your changes. But it looks like that's those are more updated premium numbers. So I would literally use that as the basis. But like Reid mentioned, we've updated the model with revised growth assumptions, so we'll send you that once it's ready for publication, which I believe would be today or tomorrow, and that'll give you the most accurate view of the premiums written. But in this case, what should happen is that the scenario results should be copied over to the consolidated results, and that's the baseline. So it's a little bit out of sync currently,
Okay. Yeah. So then I would say that the scenario results, so go over to the right, starting in column I through N, you know, that is the results the scenarios that incorporates all of your changes.

S Speaker 113:50that's okay. Paul, I think some variation is okay. So just to clarify the tabs, the scenario result is the outcome. That's the table we should look at when we discuss the plan that hdbi is driving towards, which is columns, which is the column I onwards?

S Speaker 315:57to be on the right side. Yep, makes sense. So basically, this is in process. And so what happens mechanically is that once all the assumptions are finalized, and this is really close, so I'll just give you an example, then what we would do here is we would say, okay, that's the scenario results. That's what sort of the answer is per the model. So we would just create this as the baseline,

S Speaker 316:27and then you'd see there's no change from the baseline. And then make an assumption like, hey, let's assume that in 2026 we got 23% provisional commission. Then it would just automatically float through the model, and you could see, like every change that you make, what the impact was on the model. So that's that's mechanically how it works.
and then you'd see there's no change from the baseline. And then make an assumption like, hey, let's assume that in 2026 we got 23% provisional commission.

S Speaker 116:48Okay, sounds good. So logistic to this for now what we have, so one, one question I had, and then Priyesh, you can take over from there. The GWP column i Four is a 75 million target in 2025 and the premium collected is 67 and so I wanted to know when you talk about the GWP, you're talking to speaking about line four or line five.
Okay, sounds good. So logistic to this for now what we have, so one, one question I had, and then Priyesh, you can take over from there.

S Speaker 117:44so that's the difference. Okay, so sometimes it may be coming in monthly, and I'm assuming that's what you mentioned in our call. Okay, got it sounds good. So we are targeting right now to go from 55 to 75 that's the plan presented to the board. Okay, got it all right, Priyesh, go ahead, just focus on 20 the next 18 months. Priyesh
so that's the difference. Okay, so sometimes it may be coming in monthly, and I'm assuming that's what you mentioned in our call. Okay, got it sounds good.

S Speaker 418:08got it Sure, sure. So Paul, I had a question, but I think maybe my numbers were a little bit off, so the new model would probably solve it. But in the numbers that I had the difference between premiums written to premiums collected to premium earned, were a significant drop in 2025 and then it when compared to 2024 and then again, goes back to similar numbers in 2026 so is that something that this model also has?
got it Sure, sure. So Paul, I had a question, but I think maybe my numbers were a little bit off, so the new model would probably solve it.

S Speaker 318:39Yeah, so this model is actually pretty detailed when it comes to the premiums written, earned and collected, and it depends on the timing of when that occurs within the model period. So obviously this goes after change the end of 2028 and so each month we make an assumption relative to premiums written. And then after that you make an assumption. Okay, well, for earned it's pretty easy. You earn it ratedly over the policy period, and the collective is a little bit different, because you have the installment paying insureds. And so there's always an imbalance. And depending on when the policies are written, it could lead to some outcomes that are sort of interesting. Meaning, if you back ended the policies, and you wrote a bunch of policies in the last portion of the year, your gross written premium would look higher. Your earn premium would not because you only earned it for six months or three months. And so there's always a disconnect. But the patterns that are earned are really specific in the model, and they'll show you, based on when premium is written, how it earns out over time.

S Speaker 119:38Paul, to clarify written is what, for example, if I bought a policy today, that's what will reflect in written. If I pay, if I pay monthly, the collection will reflect the cash flow cycle of collection and premium earn you, I assume it's like a SaaS business. You recognize it per month.

S Speaker 420:12all right. Got it. Another thing, Paul, on the expense Analysis tab. Now I'm not sure if the new numbers take care of it. But on my sheet, I see the telematics cost drop from $2 million roughly in 2024 to 450k in 25 Yeah, in the scenario Results tab, is that something that we should be concerned about
all right. Got it. Another thing, Paul, on the expense Analysis tab. Now I'm not sure if the new numbers take care of it.

S Speaker 320:38now? So I'm recon weighing us on this too, but I'll go first. And so, you know, we've we first started out, you know, we basically would fund the ability for a fleet to put cameras into their car, into their trucks. That's camera usage has become more you will put us now. And so we just don't think that financial burden of having to pay that on behalf of the fleets is going to manifest itself in the algae years. And so this is really just being kind of situationally aware of the marketplace. You know, obviously telematics still matter, but leaders are just not going to fund them the way we have in the past
now? So I'm recon weighing us on this too, but I'll go first.

S Speaker 421:13understood and we also discussed this slightly Paul, how do we how should we think about the slide collateral that's in the cash and cash runway. Is it an actual cash out? Is it a cash block? And you mentioned it could come back into time. So what are the thresholds of loss ratio that we should be considering?
understood and we also discussed this slightly Paul, how do we how should we think about the slide collateral that's in the cash and cash runway. Is it an actual cash out? Is it a cash block?

And you mentioned it could come back into time. So what are the thresholds of loss ratio that we should be considering?

and the release back you mentioned would could be four to five years.
S Speaker 322:37It could be, yeah, that's right, unless we're doing so well early on that we think it's not possible that we're going to have a significant obligation, then it may be earlier than that. And so those details are still being worked out with our partner, Spinnaker insurance, our funding company, the exact mechanics, but theoretically, that's how it worked.

S Speaker 122:56So one clarification on that, Paul, so let's say the gross collected premium was 100, $100 does the company roughly? When does company have access to? And your net revenue is, let's say, 20 on that one, when do you have access to that entire $20 because you also need to ensure that you have money reserved to pay in case of loss ratio, or does that come off from the muni crease? And the panelist, yeah,
So one clarification on that, Paul, so let's say the gross collected premium was 100, $100 does the company roughly? When does company have access to?

And the panelist, yeah,
S Speaker 323:27that's a great question. So we settle up every month with current activity. So we create this order report that shows all the premiums, written, claims paid, and then we get our commission sort of net of that. And so that happens on a monthly basis, and that's how we kind of fund the operations as we go. That's another point, and that's kind of why Spinnaker set up the collateral funding mechanism the way they did, because we're trying to align when we would actually collect the cash with what we would have to fund as best they possibly can, so they're not out of balance significantly, if that makes sense.

S Speaker 124:01Okay, so just to clarify mechanically, then if I had, if I wrote $100 policy, and my earnings are 20 net revenue is $20 on that every month, the business gets a percentage, pro rated percentage of that $100 assuming that month there was no loss on that policy, etc. Is that the best way to think about this simplistic?
Okay, so just to clarify mechanically, then if I had, if I wrote $100 policy, and my earnings are 20 net revenue is $20 on that every month, the business gets a percentage, pro rated percentage of that $100 assuming that month there was no loss on that policy, etc. Is that the best way to think about this simplistic?

S Speaker 324:27Yeah, definitely a good plug. So we get the premium portion, and then we have claims portion, and we're on the hook for 5% claims portion, but, like, mechanically, I think that's the way to think about it. Is that as we go throughout the course of the year,
Yeah, definitely a good plug. So we get the premium portion, and then we have claims portion, and we're on the hook for 5% claims portion, but, like, mechanically, I think that's the way to think about it. Is that as we go throughout the course of the year,

24:46was gonna clarify, just to let me just
was gonna clarify, just to let me just
was gonna clarify, just to let me just
was gonna clarify, just to let me just
S Speaker 224:50clarify. So, yeah, let's say there's no there's $100 of premium collected. Let's say there's $100 policy, or, let's just make it easy, and I'd say it's $120 policy spread out evenly over 12 months. So it's a 1010, bucks a month that we're collecting. So we will collect our 20, let's just make it round numbers, 20% commission on that at so we get the 20% commission on that. Then there is a portion of that 2020 cents, or $22 I guess $2 on the 10 every month, a portion of it gets put towards the collateral. So I think that our portion of the slide is being tweeted. Let's call it three cents. Let's call it 330 cents. 30 cents out of the $20 out of the $2 would get put into the premium would be get put into the collateral, basically, and then, depending on how we perform, or then over the then it develops out over several years. So over the course of time, let's say, two years later, there will be an adjustment based on how the loss ratio develops, whether we get that 30 cents back unlocked to us, or whether it's goes to the reinsurers for us not performing at our loss ratio target. So basically, cash that's locked it's locked up for a period of time. It's not, it's it can still be considered revenue. From a bookings perspective, it's still revenue to us. It could end up being a liability or a cost in the future, but it is a cash flow. It's not like we can use it as operating cash. So it's locked up for a period of time. It is not usable to us as an operating revenue
clarify. So, yeah, let's say there's no there's $100 of premium collected. Let's say there's $100 policy, or, let's just make it easy, and I'd say it's $120 policy spread out evenly over 12 months.

S Speaker 126:37that so that's 5% of the 20% right? Which is locked up.
that so that's 5% of the 20% right? Which is locked up.
that so that's 5% of the 20% right? Which is locked up.
that so that's 5% of the 20% right? Which is locked up.
S Speaker 226:44The 5% is different than this slide. So there's a couple of concepts going on here. This slide is, is Paul, how much of the of our 20% do we put? But as collateral in the slide, it's
The 5% is different than this slide. So there's a couple of concepts going on here. This slide is, is Paul, how much of the of our 20% do we put? But as collateral in the slide, it's

S Speaker 326:58so we have an estimated at about 6.9%
so we have an estimated at about 6.9%
so we have an estimated at about 6.9%
so we have an estimated at about 6.9%
S Speaker 227:02okay, about 6.9% now there's so that is for the whole reinsurance panel. Then, separately from that, this is where things get a little complicated. Separately from that, we are think about our captive as a reinsurer on our own panel that takes 5% of the underwriting risk. So our slide is protecting our our our captive to I think I'm not sure if our captive actually pushes the slide onto us or not, but in the theory, basically the structure is, there's the MGA and then there's and then there's the panel reinsurers behind that. We we take a 5% piece of that action, and we have this slide, that collateral, that on the on the rest of the 95% of the panel, for the for the loss ratio performance and protecting the downside of the reinsurers in that, in that loss ratio zone.
okay, about 6.9% now there's so that is for the whole reinsurance panel. Then, separately from that, this is where things get a little complicated. Separately from that, we are think about our captive as a reinsurer on our own panel that takes 5% of the underwriting risk.

S Speaker 327:56Okay, really good point, like we establish the collateral. It's balance sheet only until such time as we have a seven. So cash goes into the trust, but we can't access it. It's not a P and L, okay,
Okay, really good point, like we establish the collateral. It's balance sheet only until such time as we have a seven. So cash goes into the trust, but we can't access it. It's not a P and L, okay,

S Speaker 128:10all right. Priyes, you wanted to focus on the revenue.
all right. Priyes, you wanted to focus on the revenue.
all right. Priyes, you wanted to focus on the revenue.
all right. Priyes, you wanted to focus on the revenue.
S Speaker 428:16Yes, yes, Paul, when you send us the materials, I think this new model has updated cache as well for 2024 and the actual numbers for 2024
Yes, yes, Paul, when you send us the materials, I think this new model has updated cache as well for 2024 and the actual numbers for 2024

28:28is that right? Yeah,

this is the model that we have currently in process. Got everything updated, yeah, got it.
this is the model that we have currently in process. Got everything updated, yeah, got it.
S Speaker 428:35Paul, I see on the Model tab there is, it's, it's been broken down into smaller segments, and you have how the revenue would ramp up for each year. Would you have a weighted pipeline, or a pipeline for 2025 that we could use and validate some of these numbers?
Paul, I see on the Model tab there is, it's, it's been broken down into smaller segments, and you have how the revenue would ramp up for each year. Would you have a weighted pipeline, or a pipeline for 2025 that we could use and validate some of these numbers?

28:55So say that again. I'm sorry, just one more
So say that again. I'm sorry, just one more
So say that again. I'm sorry, just one more
So say that again. I'm sorry, just one more
S Speaker 129:04So for the top line, Paul, we want to verify you know the how much of the current revenues are flowing from the last year 2024 how much of it, it is new that the business needs to get in order to hit the numbers? Yeah, yeah.
So for the top line, Paul, we want to verify you know the how much of the current revenues are flowing from the last year 2024 how much of it, it is new that the business needs to get in order to hit the numbers? Yeah, yeah.

S Speaker 229:22Paul, then I think this is, I would just go into the revenue and premium assumptions of new versus new and renewal business, basically the production model
Paul, then I think this is, I would just go into the revenue and premium assumptions of new versus new and renewal business, basically the production model
Paul, then I think this is, I would just go into the revenue and premium assumptions of new versus new and renewal business, basically the production model

29:33that would give the numbers on on that. So, yeah, we have a

that would give the numbers on on that. So, yeah, we have a
that would give the numbers on on that. So, yeah, we have a
S Speaker 329:37separate model. It kind of works its way into this model, but it's a little bit cleaner to look at, so we'll send you the production model.
separate model. It kind of works its way into this model, but it's a little bit cleaner to look at, so we'll send you the production model.

S Speaker 129:45Yeah, so can we, can we just get a feel for it now? How much of the GW, P, so from 50 to 75 how much of the 75 is already in the bank, per se?

S Speaker 231:53might be easiest to show the production model even just flash it up. We can always send it,

might be easiest to show the production model even just flash it up. We can always send it,
32:00yeah, that's fine.
32:31Hey, all right, can you see this? Yeah,
Hey, all right, can you see this? Yeah,
Hey, all right, can you see this? Yeah,
Hey, all right, can you see this? Yeah,
S Speaker 232:50this is our this is the production model. This basically is a side model that we build, that we flow into the operating model that has all kinds of assumptions on, you know, growth and, like, where we're going to get the where we're going to get the volume and everything. And everything. Basically total premium for 2025, 75 million. Renewal premium estimate is 39 point 8 million, and New Business Premium is 35 point 6 million. So
this is our this is the production model. This basically is a side model that we build, that we flow into the operating model that has all kinds of assumptions on, you know, growth and, like, where we're going to get the where we're going to get the volume and everything. And everything. Basically total premium for 2025, 75 million. Renewal premium estimate is 39 point 8 million, and New Business Premium is 35 point 6 million. So

S Speaker 133:32so 3539 so 35 is the new and 39 is the one. When you say renewal, this will get renewed. Or is this something that's flowing from 2024
so 3539 so 35 is the new and 39 is the one. When you say renewal, this will get renewed. Or is this something that's flowing from 2024
so 3539 so 35 is the new and 39 is the one. When you say renewal, this will get renewed. Or is this something that's flowing from 2024
so 3539 so 35 is the new and 39 is the one. When you say renewal, this will get renewed. Or is this something that's flowing from 2024
S Speaker 233:47so the way it works is, these are annual policies. So we will all these policies from 2024 will okay. So we wrote, We, you know, we wrote 54 million in 2024 that's, or, you know, 50 54,000,050 5 million in 2024 all of that, all of that premium, 56,000,050 5 million, will come up for renewal in 2025. We anticipate a 72% retention rate on that, because these are the annual policies that will get competed on. And that'll put us at a 40, basically $40 million of renewal premium. And then in order to get to the 75 we've got to write 35 in new business to hit the 75
so the way it works is, these are annual policies. So we will all these policies from 2024 will okay. So we wrote, We, you know, we wrote 54 million in 2024 that's, or, you know, 50 54,000,050 5 million in 2024 all of that, all of that premium, 56,000,050 5 million, will come up for renewal in 2025.

And then in order to get to the 75 we've got to write 35 in new business to hit the 75
S Speaker 234:48Yes, yeah. So it goes from 66 to 72 and as you can see, 72 is the best assumption, or is the best we will have done on retention in in the last few years, so that, so that. But yeah, we came close to that in 2023 The reason 2024 is low on the retention. Because, you know, basically in 2024 we did a number of things. One, our loss ratio on 2022 was in when you looked at our 2022 and 2023 results, we were not where we wanted to be from a loss ratio perspective, we needed to take some additional rate ahead of the market. And so one of the dynamics was we took about 18% rate in 2024 when the market was taking somewhere in the 12 to 14% range. So we were outpacing the market a little bit on our rate need. So obviously, when you when you raise your prices more than others, that's going to have an increase impact on the retention. Obviously it has a positive impact on the loss ratio, because you're getting more premium for the accounts that you do retain, but it does have a negative effect on the retention. So one was rate rate taking, and the second was we implemented some underwriting rules here in 2024 that you basically non renewed or canceled. A decent number of policies that we had written in 2023 and 2022 that were just not performing well, and we needed to tighten our underwriting appetite. So it was a mix of tightening the underwriting appetite and it, you know, taking a little additional rate to get our loss ratio in mind with our performance on 2024 and the loss ratio and how that's trended. You know, we feel like we're basically through those those those changes and those challenges, we've kind of swallowed the medicine that we needed to swallow from the to get our loss ratio performance in line. And so this year, we are taking somewhere in the 12% range on on rate, which is, you know, in line with or maybe even a little less than the overall market. So we feel like our rate need is less than than competitors, or at least in line with competitors, and we are. We don't have any additional changes happening to the underwriting appetite. If anything, we're making some changes that would improve our retention rather than than hurt it. And so, you know, industry retention really depends on competitors, who you look at but are. But you know, the folks that we're competing with, the Great West in the in the centuries and stuff and such, have retention rates in the 75 ish range. And so you know where we are, feel confident that we're going to be moving up in that direction as we go forward from here and as we've kind of overcome some of the challenges from 2024
Yes, yeah. So it goes from 66 to 72 and as you can see, 72 is the best assumption, or is the best we will have done on retention in in the last few years, so that, so that.

S Speaker 238:04we have a mix of, you know, small and large customers. You can actually see the fleet sizes over overall. We have some in the range of 250, to 300 fleets that we insure today and but you can see, like broken down by fleet size here, where there's the most concentration. So our plan for this year has the heaviest amount of concentration. I mean, let's look at new business. Let's start with new business. You know, we're really targeting our core. Bread and butter is the five to 19 power unit space. And so there's, you know, more of those. You know, we plan on writing about 15, 15 million in small fleet this year, 8 million in premium in the 20 to 30 space, you know, etc, etc. You can see as as as the fleet sizes get larger, we actually plan to write less premium in those larger fleets. So there's really not concentration on, like, you know, one or two or three major customers or something like that. It's the core of our revenue. Is the small is the small motor carrier understood?

Andrew, what is the confidence level on hitting these numbers or 2025
Andrew, what is the confidence level on hitting these numbers or 2025
S Speaker 239:18Yeah, I'd say we have high confidence on 2025 you know, especially having replanned down out of 75 million. We did that because we want to. In the past, I think we've sorry. I don't know if I need to stop sharing, but I can always flip that back open, but, but I think,
Yeah, I'd say we have high confidence on 2025 you know, especially having replanned down out of 75 million. We did that because we want to. In the past, I think we've sorry. I don't know if I need to stop sharing, but I can always flip that back open, but, but I think,

39:37you know, in the past we we've
you know, in the past we we've
you know, in the past we we've
you know, in the past we we've
S Speaker 239:43very aggressive, and then, you know, fallen short of the plan. And that's always put us in a place where we're trying to catch up and chase the growth plan, whereas this year, we put a plan together that we feel, you know, we have high confidence that we can, we can hit and there's even a decent, we feel there's even a decent shot we can. We can over perform more, you know, hit this plan, and we, we'd like to think we can, we can hit this target and maybe even write something in the $85 million answer this year with really solid execution. So I'd say, I'd say high confidence in the plan for this year. Okay,
very aggressive, and then, you know, fallen short of the plan. And that's always put us in a place where we're trying to catch up and chase the growth plan, whereas this year, we put a plan together that we feel, you know, we have high confidence that we can, we can hit and there's even a decent, we feel there's even a decent shot we can.

So I'd say, I'd say high confidence in the plan for this year. Okay,
S Speaker 140:21got it because I remember the number was 100 at some point, and then now it's 75 so
got it because I remember the number was 100 at some point, and then now it's 75 so
got it because I remember the number was 100 at some point, and then now it's 75 so
got it because I remember the number was 100 at some point, and then now it's 75 so
S Speaker 240:26Okay, yeah, the number had stayed at 100 I would say low confidence. But given that we we targeted down, we ratcheted down to increase the confidence, and hitting it, yeah,
Okay, yeah, the number had stayed at 100 I would say low confidence. But given that we we targeted down, we ratcheted down to increase the confidence, and hitting it, yeah,
Okay, yeah, the number had stayed at 100 I would say low confidence. But given that we we targeted down, we ratcheted down to increase the confidence, and hitting it, yeah,
Okay, yeah, the number had stayed at 100 I would say low confidence. But given that we we targeted down, we ratcheted down to increase the confidence, and hitting it, yeah,
S Speaker 140:37okay, I lost my last question, Priyesh, and then you can take over, which is the business needs to raise capital in q1 of or needs to get refunded cash in the bank in q1, of 2026, so for the business to so what is the number that the business needs to hit in order to raise capital, or the M and A discussions, if you can give us some color on, how are you thinking about either a potential exit and for that, what is required on the top? Yeah,
okay, I lost my last question, Priyesh, and then you can take over, which is the business needs to raise capital in q1 of or needs to get refunded cash in the bank in q1, of 2026, so for the business to so what is the number that the business needs to hit in order to raise capital, or the M and A discussions, if you can give us some color on, how are you thinking about either a potential exit and for that, what is required on the top? Yeah,
okay, I lost my last question, Priyesh, and then you can take over, which is the business needs to raise capital in q1 of or needs to get refunded cash in the bank in q1, of 2026, so for the business to so what is the number that the business needs to hit in order to raise capital, or the M and A discussions, if you can give us some color on, how are you thinking about either a potential exit and for that, what is required on the top? Yeah,
okay, I lost my last question, Priyesh, and then you can take over, which is the business needs to raise capital in q1 of or needs to get refunded cash in the bank in q1, of 2026, so for the business to so what is the number that the business needs to hit in order to raise capital, or the M and A discussions, if you can give us some color on, how are you thinking about either a potential exit and for that, what is required on the top? Yeah,
S Speaker 241:12that's a good question. I would say, you know, the discussion of the exit of the business, let me, let me, let me just start with the with the M and A and then A funding scenario. So on the M and a front, I would say it's the the the strategic requires are, in general, less focused on top line that as they are on loss ratio. So you know, for the, for the folks that are potentially interested in buying a TVI. They're very, very indexed on have we built a better mousetrap than the than the than the industry, and do we have a good loss ratio performance? So that is the major focus that being said, there's a certain amount of scale and volume that comes your loss ratio results, or your your volatility, basically, the credibility of the loss ratio grows as you grow. So at $50 million one piece of feedback we got on this pass around is we really love what you guys are doing, but the book is still a little bit small for us to evaluate whether the loss ratio is actually credible. Because with only $50 million of premium, you have million dollar losses. You know, if you have a year, we have $5 million accidents versus 3 million, $1 million accidents, that could make a big difference in the loss ratio. So we want to see some scale. So I think somewhere in the 75 million, $80 million ranges, you know, gets you there to, you know, a highly credible loss ratio.
that's a good question. I would say, you know, the discussion of the exit of the business, let me, let me, let me just start with the with the M and A and then A funding scenario. So on the M and a front, I would say it's the the the strategic requires are, in general, less focused on top line that as they are on loss ratio. So you know, for the, for the folks that are potentially interested in buying a TVI. They're very, very indexed on have we built a better mousetrap than the than the than the industry, and do we have a good loss ratio performance? So that is the major focus that being said, there's a certain amount of scale and volume that comes your loss ratio results, or your your volatility, basically, the credibility of the loss ratio grows as you grow. So at $50 million one piece of feedback we got on this pass around is we really love what you guys are doing, but the book is still a little bit small for us to evaluate whether the loss ratio is actually credible. Because with only $50 million of premium, you have million dollar losses. You know, if you have a year, we have $5 million accidents versus 3 million, $1 million accidents, that could make a big difference in the loss ratio. So we want to see some scale. So I think somewhere in the 75 million, $80 million ranges, you know, gets you there to, you know, a highly credible loss ratio.
that's a good question. I would say, you know, the discussion of the exit of the business, let me, let me, let me just start with the with the M and A and then A funding scenario. So on the M and a front, I would say it's the the the strategic requires are, in general, less focused on top line that as they are on loss ratio. So you know, for the, for the folks that are potentially interested in buying a TVI. They're very, very indexed on have we built a better mousetrap than the than the than the industry, and do we have a good loss ratio performance? So that is the major focus that being said, there's a certain amount of scale and volume that comes your loss ratio results, or your your volatility, basically, the credibility of the loss ratio grows as you grow.

S Speaker 142:39So that's kind of number one. What is the loss ratio target that these guys are looking at?
So that's kind of number one. What is the loss ratio target that these guys are looking at?
So that's kind of number one. What is the loss ratio target that these guys are looking at?
So that's kind of number one. What is the loss ratio target that these guys are looking at?
S Speaker 342:45So for us, in the model that our target over the long term, it's a 60% what
So for us, in the model that our target over the long term, it's a 60% what
So for us, in the model that our target over the long term, it's a 60% what
So for us, in the model that our target over the long term, it's a 60% what
S Speaker 242:55I would say they'd be they'd be happy with anything in the 60s. The lower, the lower, the lower, the better. But something in the 65% range is still even highly attractive to potential acquire commercial auto and trucking is generally like broadly running at about a 7572 to 75 and so beating the loss rate, the industry loss ratio by eight to 10 points, no less 15 is is extremely attractive to an m&a target that has Commercial Auto or wants Commercial Auto and has, you know, obviously they get the benefit of managing the float and and and the insurance revenue that comes along with that. So it's a very attractive proposition, Paul, maybe you can, I don't know if it's worth going into, but just a value from the perspective of a strategic to having an asset that produces a loss ratio that's like 1015, 10% 10 points better than the industry.
I would say they'd be they'd be happy with anything in the 60s. The lower, the lower, the lower, the better.

S Speaker 343:54Oh. I mean, it's a significant, significant value. And so we think about all the companies that we talk to, and the ones that are out there, I mean, they have big commercial auto books, and what they haven't been able to do is to integrate, you know, this telematics technology and insight into their operations. Now, they dabble in it, but, you know, they don't have a way to plug and play, if you will, to get the results. And so, you know, they've got to manage these books. If you looked at the Commercial Auto broadly speaking, the market over time to combine ratio, which is just losses plus expenses, has been above 105 it has been that way for at least a decade. My goodness, okay, that's, that's the economic value. Is
Oh. I mean, it's a significant, significant value.

S Speaker 144:35the loss ratio. And Paul, who are the acquirers here for the business? You guys were in touch with them for CDC,
the loss ratio. And Paul, who are the acquirers here for the business? You guys were in touch with them for CDC,
the loss ratio. And Paul, who are the acquirers here for the business? You guys were in touch with them for CDC,

44:44yeah, I'll take that. We go ahead.
yeah, I'll take that. We go ahead.
yeah, I'll take that. We go ahead.
yeah, I'll take that. We go ahead.
S Speaker 244:50Okay, I'll take it. We had, we, you know, we had late stage conversations with a number of potential strategics. We got really far down the path with, with a few of them. You know out one was the Hartford. One was travelers we've talked to, but there was, there's a broad interest in this, in this space, you know what we're doing with telematics and Commercial Auto as well. So I think as we continue to execute on the plan and go back out to the market and call it, 12 months from now, there's a wide range of potential acquirers, and those two included, but also names like Zurich and arch and Allianz and, you know, a whole bunch of others that that are interested in, you know, acquiring something, an asset in the commercial auto space. Got it,
Okay, I'll take it. We had, we, you know, we had late stage conversations with a number of potential strategics. We got really far down the path with, with a few of them. You know out one was the Hartford.

Got it,
S Speaker 145:39and the business would start the discussions with these acquirers for a potential event in q1 of 2026
and the business would start the discussions with these acquirers for a potential event in q1 of 2026
and the business would start the discussions with these acquirers for a potential event in q1 of 2026
and the business would start the discussions with these acquirers for a potential event in q1 of 2026
S Speaker 245:49I would say we probably need to start conversations in q4 because they take time to develop the holidays and everything. So probably realistically, October, November, October, okay,
I would say we probably need to start conversations in q4 because they take time to develop the holidays and everything. So probably realistically, October, November, October, okay,
I would say we probably need to start conversations in q4 because they take time to develop the holidays and everything. So probably realistically, October, November, October, okay,
I would say we probably need to start conversations in q4 because they take time to develop the holidays and everything. So probably realistically, October, November, October, okay,
S Speaker 146:00but hoping to close a transaction in q1 of 2026, okay, and so if the business performed at 75 million of GWP, then this could be an exit of if you do the number range that you gave yesterday, if you took the number two, then It's a one, one, $50 million exit. Is that okay?
but hoping to close a transaction in q1 of 2026, okay, and so if the business performed at 75 million of GWP, then this could be an exit of if you do the number range that you gave yesterday, if you took the number two, then It's a one, one, $50 million exit. Is that okay?

S Speaker 246:23Yeah, I think that's fair down the fairway, assumption,
Yeah, I think that's fair down the fairway, assumption,
Yeah, I think that's fair down the fairway, assumption,
Yeah, I think that's fair down the fairway, assumption,
S Speaker 146:26okay? And December again, assuming perform to plan Paul, what is the cash at end of December? Or is, is that the time when you may still need additional capital infusion.
okay? And December again, assuming perform to plan Paul, what is the cash at end of December? Or is, is that the time when you may still need additional capital infusion.
okay? And December again, assuming perform to plan Paul, what is the cash at end of December? Or is, is that the time when you may still need additional capital infusion.
okay? And December again, assuming perform to plan Paul, what is the cash at end of December? Or is, is that the time when you may still need additional capital infusion.
S Speaker 346:41So at the end of the December you're talking december 25 we would still have cash to go. We would estimate that it's about $7.5 million in the bank that we have some months to run. You know, that gets us literally through June of 26
So at the end of the December you're talking december 25 we would still have cash to go. We would estimate that it's about $7.5 million in the bank that we have some months to run. You know, that gets us literally through June of 26
So at the end of the December you're talking december 25 we would still have cash to go. We would estimate that it's about $7.5 million in the bank that we have some months to run. You know, that gets us literally through June of 26

S Speaker 146:58Okay, so yesterday we discussed about a 750 K operation, operating burn. And then there is some additional capital, which is roughly about million and a half total of cash that Okay, so in December, there would be, if you assume 1.5 million that there is a three to four month cash available. Is that right? Okay, yep,
Okay, so yesterday we discussed about a 750 K operation, operating burn. And then there is some additional capital, which is roughly about million and a half total of cash that Okay, so in December, there would be, if you assume 1.5 million that there is a three to four month cash available. Is that right? Okay, yep,
Okay, so yesterday we discussed about a 750 K operation, operating burn.

Is that right? Okay, yep,
S Speaker 347:20the bird gets better over time, because is an average. And so we have a little relief from the operating perspective, then we have to put in more from a collateral perspective. So the average of the out months is about 1.3 million all in. So it gets better. Yeah,
the bird gets better over time, because is an average. And so we have a little relief from the operating perspective, then we have to put in more from a collateral perspective. So the average of the out months is about 1.3 million all in. So it gets better. Yeah,
the bird gets better over time, because is an average. And so we have a little relief from the operating perspective, then we have to put in more from a collateral perspective. So the average of the out months is about 1.3 million all in. So it gets better. Yeah,

S Speaker 147:37got it. And is the board aligned? Read on finding a buyer starting October.
got it. And is the board aligned? Read on finding a buyer starting October.
got it. And is the board aligned? Read on finding a buyer starting October.
got it. And is the board aligned? Read on finding a buyer starting October.
S Speaker 247:44Yeah, the board is aligned. I mean, I would generally call, if you ask, Will Weatherford or Jacqueline or, you know, I would say their answer would be, they are viewing this round as a is primarily a bridge to a sale. Do we, you know, there was, really, interested. There was strong interest in the company. There was a few pieces of feedback from the market that they just wanted to see a little bit more scale, a little bit more proof in the loss ratio, you know, a bit more product development on the actuarial side, which we've got going in space. And then, you know, it's just a better overall expense profile or operating profile. And so, you know, we made, we obviously did the riff we so we'll, so when we go back up to the market, we'll have about half the operating firm that we have, you know, on this last round, we will have more scale. There's, you know, we're continuing to track well on the loss ratio front. So I think that basically, the insiders that are stepping up and putting in this capital here are basically saying there is a good financial outcome for the investors who have put money into this company. We obviously want to see the company succeed. And we, you know, we think that there's, there's real upside here. They've obviously structured the deal in a way that gives them, and you the possibility of good upside in the deal with the appropriate downside protection that they're looking for. And I would say there's a scenario B or a track B, which is we could do really well this year, and entertain not just an acquisition, but also go out to the private growth markets and look to raise a private growth financing and get the company with that financing around cash flow, even positive, and then kind of control our investment past that. So there's a number of a number of outcomes that are that are real possibilities understood,
Yeah, the board is aligned.

S Speaker 149:34and since the capital raise to date is 60 million, and this round, let's say it is, bounce out to around 20 million, 80 million of capital. So the liquidation stack at 1.5 on that would be about 100 and 20 million. Is, is that the right way of thinking?
and since the capital raise to date is 60 million, and this round, let's say it is, bounce out to around 20 million, 80 million of capital. So the liquidation stack at 1.5 on that would be about 100 and 20 million. Is, is that the right way of thinking?

S Speaker 249:56That would that's assuming. It's not quite so straightforward, I think because, I don't know, because of the structure the DNA, I guess that assumes that everybody comes in and there's, then there's these various bells and whistles and stuff. I think what I've seen is the prep stack,
That would that's assuming. It's not quite so straightforward, I think because, I don't know, because of the structure the DNA, I guess that assumes that everybody comes in and there's, then there's these various bells and whistles and stuff. I think what I've seen is the prep stack,

50:16assuming, assuming
S Speaker 250:19prorona participation from everybody's 109 million. I'm not sure why it would be in but anyway, it's like 109 million with pro rata participation from everybody. There's, there's like if ATX ventures, for instance, did $4 million in the round, and they would that would go up to like 120 million. So the prep stack just depends on, on, somewhat, on the participation of the cap table into this round. But it'll be somewhere that will call it 110 100 $20 million range,
prorona participation from everybody's 109 million. I'm not sure why it would be in but anyway, it's like 109 million with pro rata participation from everybody. There's, there's like if ATX ventures, for instance, did $4 million in the round, and they would that would go up to like 120 million. So the prep stack just depends on, on, somewhat, on the participation of the cap table into this round. But it'll be somewhere that will call it 110 100 $20 million range,

If all goes well, then it is 75 million outcome for the top line, and hence, potentially 150 million acquisition. And there is three months of runway in December, that's the plan. Scenario is that right? Okay, perfect.

S Speaker 253:12mean, General, generally, yeah, we do. Will do monthly, you know, there's obviously the quarterly board meetings, but we, we will. We are, you know, extremely close and in touch with the board on a monthly basis, actually, on a weekly basis right now, but, but I would say on a monthly basis through this, through 2025, and we will Travie tracking very closely expenses and and tracking performance to plan. So if there's slips against the plan. Then we'll make, we'll make the route, you know, that needed, the needed changes to the expenses, to keep the to keep the runway, you know, where we need it, which is at least into end of q1 you know, I would say solidly in a q2, 2020, 25, six, and, and we'll continue to, I would just also say we'll continue to explore financing throughout the next six months as well, like the company performs really well. You know, I would be, I'm, I'm not opposed to raising some additional capital, sort of, as a as an additional, call it five or 10 million or something, into the business, just to extend the runway by another six months. That kid, have a benefit on the ultimate exit, exit value of the company. But that's a, you know, that's another possibility. So we'll track very closely the strategy, the cash, and then what we do with what the strategy is, you know, relative to our performing

57:29you know, at this point,
you know, at this point,
you know, at this point,
you know, at this point,
S Speaker 257:32I would say, Stephanie, what one thing is, sort of staffing is a risk or just challenge that we've that might be, I mean, will we, since the riff, so post riff, we've had a number of not surprising, but voluntary resignations and such. And so we've got to backfill some positions. And I just, you know, we need to make sure that we have the actual horsepower that the team to execute on the plan. And so, so that's one challenge that I've seen pop up of late, even in the last like couple weeks that we're that we're dealing with, that's kind of everyone what's
I would say, Stephanie, what one thing is, sort of staffing is a risk or just challenge that we've that might be, I mean, will we, since the riff, so post riff, we've had a number of not surprising, but voluntary resignations and such.

S Speaker 158:08the head count now compared to beginning of 2024
the head count now compared to beginning of 2024
the head count now compared to beginning of 2024
the head count now compared to beginning of 2024
S Speaker 358:15so head count now is 71 I believe. And I don't know about all the resignations. So maybe it's 6869 something like that. And we started out 2024, I think, with the plan around 88 so pretty significant. Okay, got it? Yeah,
so head count now is 71 I believe. And I don't know about all the resignations. So maybe it's 6869 something like that. And we started out 2024, I think, with the plan around 88 so pretty significant. Okay, got it? Yeah,

S Speaker 258:37yeah. So I would say the staffing is just one, one challenge, but we'll overcome that two competitive just the kind of competition in the market and everything. And, you know, it's a it's still maintained, you know, continues to be a competitive market. So, you know, maintaining just the overall dynamic of growing profitably, hitting a 60% loss ratio while hitting this kind of growth number of you know, called 5050, ish percent growth is is definitely still a challenge, but I think we're we're well positioned to do it this year. We have a lot fewer of the obstacles that we had last year to doing that, so I feel like our confidence is higher in our ability to do that this year. Okay,
yeah. So I would say the staffing is just one, one challenge, but we'll overcome that two competitive just the kind of competition in the market and everything. And, you know, it's a it's still maintained, you know, continues to be a competitive market. So, you know, maintaining just the overall dynamic of growing profitably, hitting a 60% loss ratio while hitting this kind of growth number of you know, called 5050, ish percent growth is is definitely still a challenge, but I think we're we're well positioned to do it this year.

S Speaker 259:33Yeah, the major the major competitors in this space are the traditional carriers, which are like Great West century, national interstate Northland canal. It's a so those competitors generally have somewhere between half a billion and a billion dollars in premium volume. The Great West and century, I think each have about a billion. Let's see. You know, some of them are small, a little bit smaller. Canal has maybe 300,000,003 400 million. Nirvana is our biggest startup competitor, so we compete with them on a head to head basis frequently. So those are our those are competitors have a

higher like priyet and central would have a higher loss ratio. They
higher like priyet and central would have a higher loss ratio. They
higher like priyet and central would have a higher loss ratio. They
S Speaker 21:00:24they generally do have a higher loss ratio that maybe tart. Their loss ratio is somewhere in the 70 to 70 75% range. Yeah, I think some of these competitors, like Great West and maybe as good as a 6560 The Great West probably has a 65 or century, I think has a 65 or so. So they're a bit better than the traditional over the overall industry has about a 72 to a 75 so they're significantly better than the overall industry. And then there's, there's competitors out there that have 85 90% 100 plus percent loss ratios,
they generally do have a higher loss ratio that maybe tart. Their loss ratio is somewhere in the 70 to 70 75% range. Yeah, I think some of these competitors, like Great West and maybe as good as a 6560 The Great West probably has a 65 or century, I think has a 65 or so.

I would say it's a mix of both, both companies that have an eye towards entering into the space. But don't, you know, there's a lot of companies that have always looked at this space and said, you know, there's a lot of premium there. It's an interesting space. But if you don't know what you're doing and you don't have the right asset, we You know you will, you will lose a lot of money.
