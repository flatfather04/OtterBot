And I can speak from experience YC Demo Day, and the YC community is where 5x to 50x distributions, that's right, epi can be found. And not too recently, I did it myself when I was sitting alongside you all at Demo Day events, just like this one, the deal flow and kinds of companies you will see here are absolutely different than the deal flow you might get outside YC, and that's a good thing. Tomorrow's returning funds are right here. Watch and it'll happen because you were able to meet some of the best technologists and builders in the world today. This collection of startups is the result of a 1% acceptance rate, easily the most selective pool of talented people in the entire world. It's our pleasure to assemble these people and introduce them to you. Our ask if you meet the founders, make up your minds and invest resolutely without that dreaded phase. Who else is investing. Get back to them in a timely manner with a clear yes or no, no ghost, and be honorable to founders. Likewise, we expect our founders to approach the craft with honor as well, and we are here with the intention that if we held this community together, more billion dollar startups that have real revenue traction, and yes, IPOs will happen through what we are all here doing today. If you're new to YC, Demo Day or YC, I wanted to call out YC group partner, Brad flora, and I will be doing a webinar on November 6, at 2pm for how to invest in YC companies, mark your calendar and be on the lookout for an invite, because yc is the tree of prosperity. We know one plus one equals three in this community, and we want you to have every tool at your disposal. Huge. Thank yous to the YC team for putting together this demo day. Lindsay Casey, Steven Ray, Lauren, Ryan, Matt and the software team. And of course, we wouldn't be able to do my sleep without, obviously, the Herculean effort and selection process partners. They are like the equal investing general partners out of fund, and I'm one of every startup.

My name is Armel, and I'm the CEO of miru. Miru provides developers with the infrastructure to easily deploy updates over the air to fleets of robots and IoT devices by simply pushing new changes to GitHub. We're three technical founders who've been best friends and have been working together ever since we met at UT, Austin. Prior to Miru, we worked on data infrastructure at Google and its software go to market Consulting at Bain. Since launching seven weeks ago, we've already signed four pilot customers, two of which are paying us today. One customer is already using Miru in production across their entire fleet, and we were able to automate their manual deployment process from 20 hours to just half an hour today, over 60 million robots and IoT devices run large compute workloads locally on the device at $24 per device per year. We're addressing a $1.4 billion market opportunity that's rapidly growing. This is our first step to becoming the AWS for edge computing. Thank you. Applause.

Ayush, hi. My name is Ayush, and I'm the co founder and CEO of Cintra. Sintra is the first AI operating system for private practice doctors, and in the past three months alone, we have signed over 170,000 worth of ARR, with an additional 700k worth of ARR on our waitlist. My co founder and I are CS dropouts who met in the dorms at Duke. We were previously EHR researchers and a built and deployed software used by Duke Hospital. Today, practices are switching off of EHRs they've used for over a decade to switch to Cintra, the comprehensive all in one solution that automates back office tasks like scribing, billing, patient intake and more. The market opportunity here is massive. A bottoms up calculation with our ACB shows you the potential for earning over 19 billion in yearly revenue. We will not stop until 1000s of doctors around the country are using Syndra together. We can set the new standard for healthcare today. We are cintro. Thank you.

Hello. I'm Andrew, CEO of evil. We will automate prompt and LLM engineering 50 times faster than a human. Instead of developers spending time on trial and error, they simply provide datasets and receive optimized prompts. In under two months, we've already built a prompt optimizer that's three times faster than the leading open source project. We have optimized 31 prompts within three weeks of launch, and we were 70% last week. A software company that serves top auditing firms uses vivo to optimize prompts achieving higher scores and smarter models and expert engineer prompts, they can finally manage hundreds of prompts without hiring more experts. Joon Tianji and I are co founders from the same university. Last year, we built 10 LM based apps and co authored a paper on fine tuning at New ribs. We really hated manual prompt digital. Now we are automating it for all developers.

Hi, I'm Shivani and I'm the CEO of ember robotics. Ember is Datadog for robots. Tesla proved that vision based autonomy works. Now the next generation of robots use cameras to see the world like people do, but cameras fail often. Our team worked across robots at Tesla, autopilot, semi robotics and the Berkeley robotics lab for seven years, we wasted hours manually scraping logs to resolve vision failures. Our software solves this by automatically detecting failures in minutes since launching six weeks ago, we have 36k in ARR with a drone startup and a 7.5k pilot with a robotics startup that raised over $100 million we are going after the 6 million robots in the US today that use cameras and charge 1k per robot annually, representing a $6 billion market opportunity. We are Ember robotics. Thank you. Applause.

Hi, I'm Darius, and my co founder ASA and I are building Genie, an AI sidekick for kids. It's been growing 37% week over week since launch. Marie PYC, founders with two previous eight and nine figure exits, but as a dad, let me tell you a story about one of our 11,000 users, a nine year old girl named Josephine, who came into our app feeling sad, hurt and unwanted because she got a fight with her mom. Jeannie met her with empathy and patience, then encouraged her to talk to her mom. But Josephine didn't want to do that. She wanted to make up a story with lots of farting. And after some convincing, Jeannie and Josephine went on a fart filled choose your own adventure story. And at the end of that, Josephine said, I feel so much better. I want to go talk to my mom. Kids like Josephine spend two hours a day in our app, crafting adventure stories, playing games and having fun with their AI sidekick. So imagine if every kid had an infinitely patient, empathetic and always fun and at the ready AI sidekick. In five years, every kid will have one, and it will be genius. Thank you. You.

Hi, I'm Darius, and my co founder ASA and I are building Genie, an AI sidekick for kids. It's been growing 37% week over week since launch. Marie PYC, founders with two previous eight and nine figure exits, but as a dad, let me tell you a story about one of our 11,000 users, a nine year old girl named Josephine, who came into our app feeling sad, hurt and unwanted because she got a fight with her mom. Jeannie met her with empathy and patience, then encouraged her to talk to her mom. But Josephine didn't want to do that. She wanted to make up a story with lots of farting. And after some convincing, Jeannie and Josephine went on a fart filled choose your own adventure story. And at the end of that, Josephine said, I feel so much better. I want to go talk to my mom. Kids like Josephine spend two hours a day in our app, crafting adventure stories, playing games and having fun with their AI sidekick.

Hello. My name is fayam, and I'm the CEO of Blaze. Blaze is global Venmo for cross border payments. With our app, you can drop into any country on the planet and pay anyone you meet as easily as sending an SMS. Blaze uses USDC under the hood to let users transact in local currency with zero hassle. We're repeat founders who scaled our last startup to a million in ARR studied math and engineering at NYU Duke and Cornell and led teams at Spotify artsy and bitpanda. We're also all digital nomads, and have seen over and over again how hard it is to pay people when traveling. We launched last week in the US and Mexico, and have already processed over 20,000 in transactions. I'm excited to say we've secured the licenses and partnerships to go live in more than 100 countries next year with over 320 million nomads and expats worldwide. This is an $11 billion market. We are Blaze, and we're building the global Venmo that we always wanted. Thank you.

I'm Joffrey, co founder of the forecasting company. We build foundation models for multimodal time series data. My co founder, Joachim and I are both machine learning PhDs from UC Berkeley and University of Edinburgh. We previously built forecasting and AI systems at Amazon, Google, brain, JP, Morgan, Bloomberg and Sonos today, when large companies need forecasts, they train bespoke ml models for each use case. We're building one model to rule them all. Our foundation model can forecast any time series in any domain with no additional training. We've signed 10 inbound pilots in the first month following our launch. We're solving critical use cases for a large furniture chain, government contractors and a multi billion dollar gaming company, just like when GPT made smaller custom models irrelevant in the next two years, all of enterprise forecasting will move to foundation models. Thank you. Applause.

Liam, Hi, I'm Liam, and I'm the CEO of codeviz. Codeviz makes visual maps of code bases and brings them right into the code editor so developers can quickly understand and navigate their code base. While we were software engineers at Tesla, we discovered a problem. Engineers spend 75% of their day reading code, not writing code. We launched this one month ago, and we've already generated more than 35,000 code maps for 1200 software engineers at companies like OpenAI and Microsoft. We know teams want this because at Tesla, we manually built these maps of code, and they went viral across engineers in our org. We're building code viz for the 19 million developers working at mid to large engineering teams. On average, we make $600 per engineer each year. So this is an $11 billion market opportunity. We think that existing tools like copilot and cursor are missing the point. They just make writing code faster and are ignoring the inevitable progress of AI. Very soon, AI will allow engineers to operate at a higher level of abstraction, where they act more like senior architects rather than junior developers, and codeviz will be the operating system they

I Previously co founded an AI startup which powered customer support for huge enterprises like Procter and Gamble we were then acquired by Coinbase, where we built their entire automated support system. Lots of companies today are building AI and customer support tooling. However, we believe the biggest opportunity in this space is enabling internal developers who want to both build and own these core experiences themselves. We are building the tooling we wish we had in Coinbase at robot. We will power all internal teams that are building the support experiences of tomorrow. Thank you.

Hi. My name is Nikhil, and I'm the CEO of rescript. We're building an AI regulatory analyst for enterprises. Our tool tracks and finds relevant legal and regulatory changes at the state and federal level and translates them to business and compliance teams. Our founding team met and became best friends eight years ago, and after spending time working on policy in Congress and building software at Salesforce, we became passionate about law and AI. We built rescript during our senior years at Stanford and Princeton, and have since grown it to 17.5k MRR and six customers if we charge $150,000 per enterprise, and given there are 60,000 of them in the major English speaking countries, this implies a $9 billion market opportunity. We're rescript. Thank you so much.

In fact, all our molecules tested to date, out compete current standard of care antibiotics. We've already signed a loi for a partnership opportunity, and our own first market is urinary tract infections. Why? Because there are 1 million people every year in a hospital in the US with a UTI, and we can charge $10,000 per treatment, which makes just our first market over ten billion we're going to use our platform to create treatment for every bacterial infection and prevent every possible future bacterial pandemic, creating the Next Genentech we're of all very Biosciences.

We launched only six weeks ago, and already have paid pilots with four industry leading funds with a total AUM of over $4 trillion they are using us to gain a competitive edge in a world where being first means everything, and because we built the fastest risk modeling software in the industry, every fund in the world will have to use us to stay competitive with each other. We are baseline. Thank you.
Sebastian, Hi, my name is Sebastian, and I'm the co founder of baseline. Baseline gives financial asset managers Citadel level risk modeling software. A lot of their alpha is captured in being able to understand changing markets quickly, and we give them the tools to do it in seconds, rather than days or weeks.

Hi, I'm Taryn, and I'm the CEO of tradeflow. Tradeflow is AI powered settlement for financial securities, a global investment firm with over $11 billion under management, uses our software to automate settlement of their derivative trades. You'd think our financial infrastructure uses advanced technology for settlement, given that it handles trillions of dollars worth of trades, but during my time at Goldman Sachs, I was shocked to learn it actually relies on 1000s of people working in emails and PDFs, powerful AI technology finally makes it possible to automate these manual workflows, enabling firms to process trades in a fraction of the time with fewer errors. In just three weeks, we signed our first financial institution for a $3,000 pilot and $17,000 contract for a subset of their trades. With 47,000 financial firms globally and an average contract of 75k this is a $3.5 billion market opportunity. We are trade flow. Thank you. Thank

Hello. I'm Connor, the CEO of deep sim. Deep sim was building AI physics simulator or AI chip design, the rapid rise of AI is driving the demand for better chips, but traditional simulation tools based on 50 year old technology simply cannot keep up. These limitations lead to chip failures and billions of dollars in lost revenue. We've seen this happen to both Nvidia and Intel just this year, our team of Stanford electrical engineering PhDs is building the first AI based physics simulator that addresses these issues by finding design flaws early. We're working with Intel to validate our software under 16 nanometer process and plan to sell to both the large manufacturers and the hundreds of smaller or rapidly growing chip design companies, the incumbent chip simulation providers like ANSYS and cadence make $2 billion a year today, and our tool is generalizable to any physics simulation, letting us eventually capture the entire $18 billion Engineering Simulation market.
