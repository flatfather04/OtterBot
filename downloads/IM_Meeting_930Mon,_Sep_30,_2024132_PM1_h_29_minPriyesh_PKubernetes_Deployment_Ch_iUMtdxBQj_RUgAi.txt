S Speaker 721:26you know, the whole, this whole contact center agent thing, not just on cloud, but also there are portion of that will begin to deploy on prem that you have this agent to work on the PC. So this model inferencing thing, ideally, it's more efficient to be wrong on the edge side. So there's this is a strategic problem.

S Speaker 821:47We'll be able to show this. We were able to show that with you before last year. So it just depends on which part of the stack the compute team was working, also with level.

What they're saying is, but they get access to data through which they can actually do auto generated reports or configs, right? Config management. So I'm not pitching this. He'll probably

So it's not understanding this is the OS that runs on the switch box, so
So it's not understanding this is the OS that runs on the switch box, so
S Speaker 134:28somebody needs to manage the switches, right? So there might be a team that's sitting and looking after the Arista dashboard, managing Arista switches. But I

S Speaker 334:38thought the program and something similar, or
S Speaker 134:42maybe no so, so Arista, there is no VMware like there was in Kubernetes. There's no VMware here, though. The only other player that is another startup that tried this almost three years ago, hedgehog. So I'm reaching out to them. It's a very small startup. It's not a big so that's the other thing, right? So as Kubernetes had multiple players, right? This space doesn't have multiple players, so if they want to hit big, they can become a sizable opportunity. But
maybe no so, so Arista, there is no VMware like there was in Kubernetes. There's no VMware here, though.

S Speaker 335:16this is very different. This is the only, if I understand you, only on switches.

this is very different. This is the only, if I understand you, only on switches.
S Speaker 135:22Yeah, only on switches. No, I'm not saying that. I'm not comparing. I'm saying that they are built on an open source platform like Kubernetes. They were built on Kubernetes, right? I'm comparing that. I'm not comparing the end market. Okay,
Yeah, only on switches. No, I'm not saying that. I'm not comparing. I'm saying that they are built on an open source platform like Kubernetes. They were built on Kubernetes, right? I'm comparing that. I'm not comparing the end market. Okay,

S Speaker 135:38so I think, but do you have any names that we can we can reach out to to aside from Rajiv, that we can get some knowledge on. I spoke with Alex, by the way, from Digital Bridge. So he's spoken to these guys. He says, I know these guys. Well. They're really solid. Their story is not well put together. And it was a text message. I didn't have a chance to dig into it. So he he commented. Story was not but he, he vouched for the team at least. Yeah, that's the key question. I don't know if it's at his scale, though, and I don't know if he does series A but I can follow up Quinn on that.

S Speaker 336:16I don't know. This is not concerned, though. This is more in a switching side. Yeah,

I was saying that it's in the what do you call pensando ecosystem? Yeah.
S Speaker 336:27Let's figure out. Let's figure out plan. Do you guys know, like anybody versus this area? The only reason I know is because Naomi was doing some acridine

S Speaker 136:38stuff, exactly, and I worked on pensando with Alex, so I remembered this, this piece, and the market overall. In fact, if you look at it's only four players today. So the market is growing low single digits today. And with AI, of course, you need fast gig network, switch communication, so that's also changing, and the there are only four players that dominate the market, so Arista, Huawei, Cisco, and the new trend is most of them are going ODM direct, yeah. And that's where the opportunity could be Quinn, which is if you go ODM direct, you might want to use more open source. You don't want to stick to Arista stack and and then it can then the market is different. If that happens,
stuff, exactly, and I worked on pensando with Alex, so I remembered this, this piece, and the market overall. In fact, if you look at it's only four players today.

S Speaker 337:28yeah, see, my worry is the parameter. You guys will do their own thing, whatever they'll do in their data center, Amazon, right? Enterprise guys, I don't know if this is a major issue for them to stop, because there's not that many. This is a top right switch. They don't have that many, so I don't know if they care.
yeah, see, my worry is the parameter. You guys will do their own thing, whatever they'll do in their data center, Amazon, right?

S Speaker 137:49So that's that's why we should talk to the eBay's and the Walmarts and the apples of the world to see why. So one thing I noticed,
So that's that's why we should talk to the eBay's and the Walmarts and the apples of the world to see why. So one thing I noticed,
So that's that's why we should talk to the eBay's and the Walmarts and the apples of the world to see why. So one thing I noticed,
So that's that's why we should talk to the eBay's and the Walmarts and the apples of the world to see why. So one thing I noticed,
S Speaker 437:59these companies actually have a skill, but Walmart, eBay,
these companies actually have a skill, but Walmart, eBay,
these companies actually have a skill, but Walmart, eBay,
these companies actually have a skill, but Walmart, eBay,
S Speaker 338:09but, but even then, I don't know how many switch they buy. These are, like, on top of the rack, on the server stack, right, right? They can't really care for Sonic or something else, I don't know. Okay, let's talk to Rajiv. He might be biased, but let's get feedback.
but, but even then, I don't know how many switch they buy. These are, like, on top of the rack, on the server stack, right, right? They can't really care for Sonic or something else, I don't know. Okay, let's talk to Rajiv. He might be biased, but let's get feedback.

S Speaker 138:23Yeah, and it's also cost element. I can I can show you the cost benefit here, but there is more value problem, yeah, then just being vendor agnostic, but we can talk to Rajiv and get some insights.
Yeah, and it's also cost element. I can I can show you the cost benefit here, but there is more value problem, yeah, then just being vendor agnostic, but we can talk to Rajiv and get some insights.
Yeah, and it's also cost element. I can I can show you the cost benefit here, but there is more value problem, yeah, then just being vendor agnostic, but we can talk to Rajiv and get some insights.

S Speaker 338:36Let's get some insights from him first. He might be very biased, yeah. It
Let's get some insights from him first. He might be very biased, yeah. It
Let's get some insights from him first. He might be very biased, yeah. It
Let's get some insights from him first. He might be very biased, yeah. It
S Speaker 338:48we got to basically try to talk to some people in the industry to figure this one out. Yeah,
we got to basically try to talk to some people in the industry to figure this one out. Yeah,
we got to basically try to talk to some people in the industry to figure this one out. Yeah,
we got to basically try to talk to some people in the industry to figure this one out. Yeah,
S Speaker 338:59Takes the eight minute maybe 30 seconds, which is within 10 minutes, right? Yes, perfect, yeah,
Takes the eight minute maybe 30 seconds, which is within 10 minutes, right? Yes, perfect, yeah,
Takes the eight minute maybe 30 seconds, which is within 10 minutes, right? Yes, perfect, yeah,
Takes the eight minute maybe 30 seconds, which is within 10 minutes, right? Yes, perfect, yeah,
S Speaker 139:08yeah, this will be, this will be faster, because we discussed this before. So I presented this in May, May of 2024, so a few months ago, and at that time they were not raising capital, so the founder reached out last week, saying that, hey, we have a preemptive term sheet coming, and he wanted to, because of the work we've done in the past, I also connected them with Qualcomm it, which didn't go anywhere. So that's a separate story, but he was, he was, of course, interested in the effort that we put in to actually get him as a customer, get him Qualcomm as a customer. So here's what they solve, right? The pain point that exists today in enterprises, including
yeah, this will be, this will be faster, because we discussed this before. So I presented this in May, May of 2024, so a few months ago, and at that time they were not raising capital, so the founder reached out last week, saying that, hey, we have a preemptive term sheet coming, and he wanted to, because of the work we've done in the past, I also connected them with Qualcomm it, which didn't go anywhere.

The pain point that exists today in enterprises, including
S Speaker 339:51Qualcomm, it seems like it's ampable for every company. That
Qualcomm, it seems like it's ampable for every company. That
Qualcomm, it seems like it's ampable for every company. That
Qualcomm, it seems like it's ampable for every company. That
S Speaker 139:55is exactly true, but more so for large, mid to large size enterprises, right? With multiple developer teams, multiple development environments. So the stack here is 20 plus different dev tools are being used in any organization. And I think within Qualcomm, probably it will be more if, because, because of the number of developer teams we have, and it takes months to just set it up. So when you set it up, you have to come up with the you know, your security policies, your role based access, and you know the configuration. It is not standardized across the organization, right? And in terms of managing every tool is managed by somebody else, like the Sonic, right? So somebody is sitting and managing the sonic but this is not solving the sonic problem. What I'm what I'm saying is there are multiple tools. It's highly complex, it's costly to maintain and and it's resource intensive. What do these guys do? So they've built an orchestration platform for their tools. So this is a Gartner defined category. So it's not like creating something new, which is a they solve for these complex integrations beforehand. So when you go to the website, you can just plug and play, click, click, click, and you'll have Jenkins, you know, tool ready that can be used across the organization, right? And it is, it can be automatically deployed to the cloud environment that you've already integrated with, with the security policies and configs that you've defined for the entire organization. So think of it as reducing management headache and optimizing the tool span for your organization.

But didn't we do you talk to companies in this category?

S Speaker 441:41It's more infrastructure. This is more on the tools.

That is different, that's completely different in the Tools everything.
That is different, that's completely different in the Tools everything.
That is different, that's completely different in the Tools everything.
S Speaker 441:55Because generally, you know, we have my conversations. It they're very negative. They're about tool space. It's a very small market. It's very saturated, okay? And we have internal team, you know, doing this kind of stuff. So every time we show them, like desktop tools, there's a we don't need this. This one, you

S Speaker 942:17have an independent opinion on this.
42:21I think our work is small, too small. Opinion on
S Speaker 442:26work as small, small, but not just my opinion. I think multiple. I think tech blogs out there complaining is very hard to sell these kind of solutions into the space.
work as small, small, but not just my opinion. I think multiple. I think tech blogs out there complaining is very hard to sell these kind of solutions into the space.

S Speaker 144:31I can get the average ACV. It could be more than at least 150 k.

44:39So the run is they have a term sheet yet, or not yet,
So the run is they have a term sheet yet, or not yet,
So the run is they have a term sheet yet, or not yet,
So the run is they have a term sheet yet, or not yet,
S Speaker 144:42it is a preemptive they were not planning on raising Quinn because when I last presented, I had told the team that they will come QR next year, but they're getting a preemptive term sheet from a financial VC. He's not, he's a bit cagey about the details until he signs the term sheet so but what he told me is, there's a $20 million round coming together. Lead might put in 10 to 12. The last course was 80.
