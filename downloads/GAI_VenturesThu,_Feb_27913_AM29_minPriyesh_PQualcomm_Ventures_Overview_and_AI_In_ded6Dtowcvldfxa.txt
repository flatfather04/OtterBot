S Speaker 22:07I think you have covered areas, just maybe one. I think you have seen the deck. So you would have seen like we are a holding company or a venture builder structure. But mostly, you know, since Qualcomm enters, guessing like it's proprietary capital, so that should not be an issue, right?

S Speaker 22:37Okay, great. So let me, let me start first and give a very brief overview of myself and Bucha, and you know what we are trying to do here. So I actually built a company in the US in the FinTech space earlier, called Medici. It was basically we started very early in FinTech, in 2013 and basically build it for next seven, eight years, it was like Bloomberg for FinTech space, very close to CB insights model. And our differentiation was that we were very, very deep in financial services only, like we unlike CB insights or traction, which basically look at like 100 different sectors, we were only focused on financial services and fintech sector, and we were tracking 17,000 FinTech, private FinTech companies and collecting millions of data points on them, you know, through basically a technology platform as well. As you know, like startup founders also doing the same thing. And our customers were really banks, FIS and technology companies who wanted to partner with these FinTech companies, wanted to use their products, or m&a or investment, right? And we sold a company in 2021 to prove. Prove is a New York based identity authentication FinTech company. After the acquisition, they asked me to build the India Asia business, which I did for two and a half years. And after building a team, launching their products and getting some initial customers. I left in late 23 and I was looking at my next gig. And basically, you know, I was an investor in Bucha company. Bucha will give us background now, but then we started talking about AI and specialties financial services in early 2024 and that's how gi ventures got created, but I just take a pause and let Bucha give us background

as well. Thanks. Thanks.

as well. Thanks. Thanks.
S Speaker 34:32Yeah, likewise. So I graduated from wits with computer science engineering back in 2019 in 2019 like while there worked a lot on machine learning, and then the problem statements as well. Something interesting I did was building a standalone speech to text model for Indra Gandhi center for Atomic Research. That's an Atomic Research being in Tamil Nadu, owned by department atomic energy. So, yeah, kind of got interested. There. Emailed a few professors, got in touch with one in Netherlands, we started working on a problem, statement of AI soccer, similar to how there's AI for chess and alpha goer, right? Like, I want to create something similar for soccer, football. Well, it's more complicated, because everyone's moving at every frame, all the players are moving, right? So, yeah, ended up invite calling me there. Eventually enrolled into masters as well. So worked on working for two years. We published a few research papers. Got some state of the art research as well, but, but then it's still largely an unsolved problem. Google still publishes a research paper almost every year, like there was one very recently as well. So, yeah, but it's still a complicated problem. But then started a FinTech while they're COVID based out of India. That's our method. I know each other. He was the first investor and my advisor that made some funding, and then moved to India for around three and a half four years, moved out of it in September 2023, after that, was explaining more in AI, got in touch with Amit. And then, based on guy, which is, I think that's where we are today, and a little about guy ventures, which we will we will talk about later as well. We feel this is an optimal way of building an AI, especially because the build process itself is cut short now, and also there is scope for making modules like we can modularize a lot of components which we intend to build, right? So that's how it started, and eventually, it's been an year now, so we've done through tech. I'll have beneath do a quick intro as well. When he joined us, like three months ago. Yeah, he's business partnerships and stuff. We need to work to you. Maybe you can just do quickly?

S Speaker 47:21Sure. Thanks. Thanks, for sure. I'll keep it short, Priyesh, I appreciate three people to you being one so but listen, I mean, I was like question. Said, I I joined guy ventures recently, last three months, but I've known Amit, especially for very long time. But in terms of my background, I've been in financial services as well. I was with HSBC back for a very long time, actually. So I was in the payments and corporate banking division leadership roles across Europe, US, Hong Kong, etc. In fact, spent a lot of time in San Francisco. I used to look that up until 2020, as well. And now, of course, working closely with Amit and Kushal and kind of our markets are largely us, Western markets, financial services so very aligned with what I've done in my past as well. And we'll kind of get into more detail shortly. Got it. Got it. And

S Speaker 18:21a very quick question team there, I saw that the company is a US delivered Corp. The founding name would still be based in India. Is that true?

S Speaker 28:32So Kushal is planning to move there this year itself. And then basically answer is based out of Dallas, who's building audit AI, one of the companies with us, and then we plan to hire more people in the US. Got it, okay, and then Vineet and I will keep traveling, but yeah, the primary market is going to be us. And both the companies that we are building right now are actually focused on the US.

S Speaker 19:01Understood. Got it, yeah. I just wanted to be clear, if we should route this through our Indian venture arm or just a US team. Can take it, yeah.
Understood. Got it, yeah. I just wanted to be clear, if we should route this through our Indian venture arm or just a US team. Can take it, yeah.

S Speaker 114:16so Amit, I understand that maybe just taking a step back. So with GI ventures, if if you will, I can I call it as a venture studio with AI native technical team, which can quickly build prototypes, and then you onboard external founders use their expertise to scale some of these individual ventures across the market.

S Speaker 214:45Yes, I think that would be a very fair description. I would just add a few more things. You know, sometimes the founder and us, we do brainstorming and narrow down an idea. For example, Anza wanted to automate the entire compliance value chain. And because of our startup experience, both Kushal and I are second time founders, we said that, let's pick one particular area where we can be like a mandatory thing, a painkiller. And that's where we narrowed it down to audit, and then we started building it. So the involvement, you know, was like right from the beginning. And second thing is that technical capability and basically some experience of building startups and growth and marketing that Vineet and I bring to the team
Yes, I think that would be a very fair description. I would just add a few more things. You know, sometimes the founder and us, we do brainstorming and narrow down an idea.

S Speaker 115:30understood. So to what extent does your involvement remain in the company once it has been built? And let's say someone like an answer is scaling it?
understood. So to what extent does your involvement remain in the company once it has been built? And let's say someone like an answer is scaling it?

understood. So to what extent does your involvement remain in the company once it has been built? And let's say someone like an answer is scaling it?
S Speaker 215:40Yeah, so our model is that we set up a milestone. So for audit, AI, we have set up a milestone of $1.5 million in revenue. The way that we sort of cross that revenue threshold, then we will carve out the company. Gi ventures will keep about 35% of the company, and the remaining will be swap pool any other founder team members and answer, and the reason for that is that we want to give the team, you know, bulk of equity, so that they are motivated in the long run to keep it
Yeah, so our model is that we set up a milestone. So for audit, AI, we have set up a milestone of $1.5 million in revenue.

S Speaker 116:10right. That makes sense. And then gi ventures, will you? Will you have preferred ownership? Will you get diluted in the rounds coming up?
right. That makes sense. And then gi ventures, will you? Will you have preferred ownership? Will you get diluted in the rounds coming up?
right. That makes sense. And then gi ventures, will you? Will you have preferred ownership? Will you get diluted in the rounds coming up?
right. That makes sense. And then gi ventures, will you? Will you have preferred ownership? Will you get diluted in the rounds coming up?
S Speaker 116:50Understood, understood. And how do you see the future of it? How do you assess which specific markets I understand Fintech is a broad specialty of the team, but how do you assess specific markets to go in with. How do you sort of decide where the time of the team would be spent, which specific areas? How do you sort of skim the entire market and spread your bandwidth across it?
Understood, understood. And how do you see the future of it?

S Speaker 119:58three. And I understand that. And do you think it would take a lot of your bandwidth, like the core team members of guy ventures, in scaling some of these ventures? Because, let's say, just taking the example of the previous company you showed me, I'm not very familiar with exact compliance process that go in financial services. But I from a macro perspective, I see a lot of companies building compliance workflow automation for some of these, for healthcare, for legal, for financial services. So while it's a very big time, and I agree it's a very big value proposition to solve for, there will be a lot of companies doing that exact same thing, and for you to sort of be competitive in the market, you will have to spend a lot of time, a lot of R and D efforts, a lot of customer calls, keep iterating on the product. But at the same time again, you would also be spending your time on building some new other ventures, apart from just the audit compliance. So how are you thinking about that?
three. And I understand that. And do you think it would take a lot of your bandwidth, like the core team members of guy ventures, in scaling some of these ventures?

But at the same time again, you would also be spending your time on building some new other ventures, apart from just the audit compliance. So how are you thinking about that?
S Speaker 221:03Yeah, so, you know, I think it's a fair question, and you know, something that we have thought through, that's why we are doing this, and not just one company, like just between you and me. I mean, I'm not saying that this very casually, but basically this bunch of people, and when VC firms who want to fund audit AI as a separate company and but, you know, this is our structure, and the way that we deal with this is like threefold. One is that we have like somebody like answer, you know, lead this so day and night, he's only thinking about this company. He's not involved in anything else. Secondly, from our side, we will have one of us in the senior management also focused on, like, one of the companies. And then there is a team, and you're like, for example, there will be an engineer dedicated to this. There will be, that's how we are looking at it. And and then, you know, there are like, sort of natural flows of where the time, you know, when the time, there's a very thick involvement. And then, you know, it sort of, you know, goes up and down. For example, right now, Kushal is spending 80% of his time building this particular solution because it has gone through two iterations. It's a very hard problem to solve, probably Kushal can explain you why, but yeah, so there is a very thick involvement of Kushal at this time, because we need to build a very good platform which can do these audits, like the way anzar wants it to, and like the way the customers would also benefit from. But then, you know, then there's a lot of maintenance and upkeep, and, you know, new feature development and all that there, you know, like architect, like questions, time reduces a little bit, and then maybe we are building the second company in which suddenly is time goes up. So there's a little bit of mapping that we have done in terms of what we can do at certain point of time, like we can only do two companies at any given point of time. So, so that is a proposed Priyesh. And you know, we feel like you should be able to manage it, given the way that
Yeah, so, you know, I think it's a fair question, and you know, something that we have thought through, that's why we are doing this, and not just one company, like just between you and me. I mean, I'm not saying that this very casually, but basically this bunch of people, and when VC firms who want to fund audit AI as a separate company and but, you know, this is our structure, and the way that we deal with this is like threefold.

So, so that is a proposed Priyesh. And you know, we feel like you should be able to manage it, given the way that
S Speaker 422:59we are designed. If I may just add Priyesh, because you were asking about GTM, one thing that we are quite confident of and hopeful of is that once we build the first couple of companies, we can templatize a lot of these. Obviously the specific segments and markets for each product will be different, but the broad approach across the different levers to kind of pull right for GTM, etc. You can templatize it, and then the core team will also have strong experience in how to go about it, so that we will also kind of get off the ground a bit quickly. We already starting to see that, you know, with the audit, what we're doing for audit, in some ways replicating that with the other company, etc.

S Speaker 123:39Yeah, that makes sense. Totally so team, I understand this. It's a very, I would say, ambitious project, for sure, and down the line it can, it can be very interesting from a venture investment perspective. I just like to be frank with you, I don't see it working out for us at this stage, particularly because as a team and the way we take investment decisions, I would not be able to sort of bring forth one particular product to the team and say, This is how my convictions are shaping up at this point. It could go multiple ways. So it would be around early for us. And even the check size, I don't think we would do anything below $2 million so the check size is small as well, but I'm happy to sort of continue this discussion, maybe connect you to some people in the market. And I'm just curious, amanthan team, how if you are approaching venture capitalists, do you see this as a fit for some of their investment portfolio, or do you see this more coming up as a structure wherein you talk to some LPs and sort of structure guy ventures as a independent studio or as a venture fund with a studio arm all together? Yeah,
Yeah, that makes sense. Totally so team, I understand this.

24:54that's a great question, I think.

that's a great question, I think.
that's a great question, I think.
S Speaker 224:58And Priyesh, like we have also learned it over a period of time by going through like, you know. So we have been pitching since the first week of January. So it's been like almost two months. We have about we have a term sheet for $1.3 million from a corporate proprietary capital. And then basically one of the banks, venture arms, is very interested. But just like you, it's probably around early for them, and they also want to see if there's another corporate venture arm, if is interested. And that's why, one of the reasons of you know, talking to you, you know, obviously, you know, we understand that your check size is smallest. Check is bigger than around. But, yeah, so, so the long story short is that we this is not typical asset class for a PC firm which has taken money from like 50 or 100 LPs. This is basically for proprietary capital, either single LP funds, corporate ventures or corporates directly from the village and family companies.
