S Speaker 11:09Hey, Frederick. Can you hear me? Hello. Nice to meet you. Hi, Frederick, pleasure meeting you. I know we took us some time to get this scheduled. I had a couple of weeks off with some off site and other conferences we were hosting, so took me some time. No worries. How are you doing, Frederick? And where are you calling in from? Berkeley. Okay, so, so are you based? Here is the team based in Berkeley. That's right. Yeah, got it. And your offices, and say, places where you assemble and test robots, everything is

S Speaker 23:12Yeah, sure. We can go over that quickly, and then I can dive deep into the background. Yeah, yeah. In terms of where we are in the fundraising, we're in late stage conversations with several large funds. They're doing due diligence right now. So expecting a turn sheet probably like in

3:27a week or two. Got
S Speaker 13:28it. Got it. Frederick, super interesting. So we are very stage agnostic. Frederick. We have done speed with check sizes of as low as $2 million and then we have done very late, pre IPO rounds as well. And our check sizes would follow the spectrum of two to $15 million depending on the round and the size. We don't have any ownership mandates as such. So we are flexible in that area. And then decision timelines usually takes us four to five weeks to come to a decision. That's like from the first meeting to writing a check. Sometimes if, say, you have a lead investor, and you there's a diligence report, we can sort of use that to fast track our processes. So that's broadly where we are from. From process perspective, we have a couple of calls. We have an internal I am meeting one of the meetings I would like you to meet my Managing Partner, Tushar, who's also spending a lot of time in robotics. I work with him directly on robotics focus areas, and then one management call, pitching to the entire management team. That's that's broadly our process.

I'm not as familiar with with the space so vertical, the vertical you're targeting, and what are the pain points there, things like that. Would love to understand.

S Speaker 29:37Is this plane, yes, okay, that's so funny. I've never seen that before. Okay, so let me go from the start. So okay, so our robot retrieves the medication from the central pharmacy. The medication is stored in these these shelves, you can see it taking the medication and putting it into the robot's own drawers. It loads itself up completely, and then it travels through the hospital to various medication

S Speaker 210:22it's understanding that by using so there are visual cues, visual markers, AR tags on these bins and on the shelf, and that's how it knows what medication is where. Yeah, and we use a visual language action model to actually control the robot precisely to do the task. Got it? Yeah, cool, yes. It travels through the hospital. It will then get to medication cabinets. It will authenticate with the cabinet by either typing up the screen or through an electronic interface. The robot will then open up its drawers and restock all these items into the cabinet, and it's able to handle the entire range of form factors, from vials, syringes, cream, tubes, boxes, pretty much anything that you have in a cabinet. And it scans the barcodes, which is crucial, because it needs to remove any expired medication confirm it's the right medication. And at the end, it provides reports to the pharmacist, telling them exactly if everything went correctly, if they're an expired medication and so on got it. That's very crucial for compliance purposes. Yeah. And we have actually multiple different use cases. That was just one use case, pharmacy. So there's another use case with assembling trays. That one will be the first market that's even simpler. It's just taking medication from the shelf and putting it into the tray assembly medication trays for various purposes. And the other is, as I explained, the entire workflow of restocking medication candidates. And we're estimating that we're going to be having about 120% ROI on this if we charge around $80,000 a year. And the last step is what we just piloted Mayo Clinic. And then now I wanted to go in a little bit deeper into economics. And so for a 400 bed hospital, as I said, we have 64 technicians for the medication distribution, which is about 45% of their work, we believe we can do about 80% of this job, and that would be replacing about 23 technicians, and for the inventory management, it would be around seven, so eventually about half the team could be augmented with robotics. And how the economics work out is that the typical hourly cost for pharmacy technicians is $40 if you factor in, training, recruitment, turnover, 20% per year. And the robot is about $9 an hour, if you account for $80,000 initial price, price point. And it's going to be a pure RAS subscription model robotics as a service. So our production cost at 300 units is estimated to be around $20,000 there's going to be a $5,000 per year cost for monitoring and tele operating robots in the in the rare case that something unexpected happened, and that means we would need 15 robots, and that could save about $1.4 million a year and provide around 120% ROI with three months with a three month payback period.

And how's the production happening today? Frederick,
S Speaker 213:29how's the production? Yes, in house right now. It's all in house assembly. Since we're like right now, we built three robots. And of course, once we make more, we'll need a dedicated production or assembly facility.

S Speaker 213:46So we're we're getting parts, sourcing parts globally, and we were buying industrial robot arms. The base is from it, from another company. And for the next generation, it'll be similar. So we'll have various different suppliers for different components and the assembly in the US.

S Speaker 214:15The current prototype is a bit higher. It's about 50, but I think for 300 unit production run. I think we can get down there. Got it. And our go to market is to start with these tier one flagship academic large hospitals like Mayo Clinic, where we just piloted Johns Hopkins. These are about there are about 250 of them, and you can definitely charge 80k per year. We already discussed that with Johns Hopkins, and they're okay with it, yeah. And then in the future, we'll expand to, in the next two to three years, to the large systems like Kaiser, HCA, Advent, health and so on, which is about like 50% of the market. And then there are smaller hospitals. And then for that, we need to reduce the price of the robot, and that's possible once we have larger quantities.

Eventually, our goal is to automate not just medication distribution, but supply distribution, and then lab sample distribution, food serving, linens, and that will eventually need an additional So altogether, it would need more than for a typical 400 bed hospital you're looking at like 40 plus robots, and these are multi purpose robots that can do multiple different

S Speaker 115:45things. Got it, got it. And Frederick just, just a quick question. You mentioned earlier that the robot also provides a compliance report. Is there a central CRM for medical distribution that most of these hospitals use, that you integrate with. How does this happen? Currently,

S Speaker 216:02exactly. So they have IT systems. They have their supply chain, or like a medication database, which is usually supplied by this company called Becton Dickinson BD. So they're also selling the medication cabinets. And so that's basically a fully integrated solution. It's a software solution that plugs into the medication cabinets making sure you get all like the refill reports when something goes low in quantity, it sends an order electronically to the technician to fill the cabinet. And now we'll route that to the robot and for that book, we're also doing a lot of software integrations already, starting right now with Mayo Clinic, and so eventually it pretty deep integration, and that's going to add to the moat as well. And it's going to be very replicatable across hospitals, so they all use the same software. So once you figure out the interfaces, they're all transferable. Got it? Got it

S Speaker 220:20Right? So it's measured, measuring the speed and reliability. So right now, we're at 150 items per hour, which is roughly on par with what humans can do, and then reliability. We're currently doing very large scale validation runs to check that, but it is generally much better than humans, which is around 4.2% error rate. Their studies showing that. So it's pretty high error for humans, we can definitely get below that. Got it. Got it.

S Speaker 120:51And how do you see, say, Frederick at Mayo, you have the first pilot done. You have a pilot opportunity now and then commercial deployment of, say, four to six robots. How do you see the scaling inside a hospital? What's your sort of understanding of proving out the ROI and then expanding across a plan that you've already gone

S Speaker 221:13right? So the plan is, we start with these paid pilots, and then we can deploy up to 15 like in a larger like, for example, Mayo Clinic, they have actually 20 large clinics. So it's a really large hospital system, so just one of them, one of their hospitals. So if one of that hospital would need about 15 robots, we actually pilot at a 1200 bed hospital, so you need about 45 robots there for just medication distribution. So of course, if we, if we can get the initial pilot successful, proving the Ri then we can expand within medication distribution, and then we can expand in supply distribution. We can expand to other logistics tasks. So even one hospital, one of their large hospitals, can take, like, if it's a 1200 bed hospital, well, that that can take more than 100 robots, just one hospital, and then now that 20 hospitals. So you can be selling like, you can be licensing, like, 1000s of robots just for Mayo Clinic, yeah. So it's a huge opportunity, but you always have to start small. And that's that's just the nature
