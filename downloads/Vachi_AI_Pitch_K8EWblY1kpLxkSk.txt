He, he, I mean, my background is engineering and at Qualcomm So, and then I moved to product several years ago, and that's when Manish and I first started working together, and then then I was managing a few businesses at Qualcomm, and then over the last eight years, I've been working at Qualcomm ventures. And then I manage North America investments for Qualcomm ventures and for Qualcomm ventures, the way we invest is we invest in areas that are strategic to Qualcomm. And then, so the area that Manish is working in right now, which is this, laptops and PCs, we believe the future of PCS is going to be AI

S Speaker 35:00So that's where it is. But then there's lots of other growth areas. But of course, mobile is a big business for Qualcomm, but then data center is a big business growth, a growth business for Qualcomm.

So, yeah, we've been working on it for like, what about 989? Months at this point. Started March. Co founder, took a break, got married. So life happened directly. I think this stuff goes on, but it's been, we've made a lot of progress since. And before I jump in, Priyesh, do you want to introduce yourself? And then I'll just

S Speaker 210:04for that connection. And so my co founder, and he was most recently, when I picked up the call and we got decided to quit our jobs, he was building large scale AI systems at Flipkart. I don't think I need to tell you guys about Flipkart, huge Amazon competitor in India, right? And so he was building the systems that land on their home page, the search page, and like so he's been able to build systems at scale. Before that, he's built startups that were bought by companies like Disney. And so again, we both have a mix of doing things from scratch, scaling to hundreds of millions, and we have a deep connection together. And we both felt this specific problem, which was, and this is just not, not just a meetup member. There's actually, actual research backing this up. 75% of a typical knowledge workers days are spent on logistics, right? You're shuffling paper email meetings, and you don't have enough time to keep up. It wasn't just the me problem. I spoke to a bunch of others, and all of them concurred that would give me conviction to sort of jump in. And the other writing that I saw on the wall was like, hey, individual productivity is going through the roof, right? Like cost of execution is going down to zero. Teams are getting faster. So the bottleneck is the manage. Managing it all right? Managing this flow of information, making decisions more people when keeping the thing moving, that becomes the bottleneck, and we don't have great AI tools for that, right? And so that was sort of the pieces there. And then I was looking for a solution. When I was like, how do people solve this? Turns out like, if you're an exec or a founder, you have this person called the Chief of Staff, right? And this chief of staff is doing a lot of your back end work. They're anticipating what you need, and based on that, they're protecting your focus and keeping you sort of engaged with a few key important things while they manage the rest of the noise, right? And that was sort of my motivation, or not staff, that continues to be what I want to build for the future, right? So when I think of my game, what should my product do? I'm thinking about what, what, what does a chief of staff do, or what would they do in the situation? And that's how I'm building my and designing my experience, right? And so that's sort of the thesis. One of the gaps we identified in what exists out there is, like most tools, and the obvious solution for this is just connect with all your tools, get all the context, and go from there. We can do that. Anyone can do that. But I think the thing that's missing out there today is we don't know what's going on in your head, right? So by the time it makes it into a tool, it's been filtered, it's been processed, right? And we wanted to get that raw connection which a chief of staff does have access to, right? You go into a room, you have a conversation, so they actually understand you more deeply than you would if all you did was heard you in a meeting, get your email right. And that was sort of the key thing that we identified. I spoken to, like lots of people. And this also, actually, so
for that connection. And so my co founder, and he was most recently, when I picked up the call and we got decided to quit our jobs, he was building large scale AI systems at Flipkart.

S Speaker 213:19So awesome. So let me sort of pick an example, and sort of, I really need it with others. So I've spoken to a bunch of Chief of Staff. Have spoken to a bunch of founders executives. What I've realized is a Chief of Staff becomes very personal, and they are in tune with your needs specifically, right? So when my leader, let's say, is asking me as a chief of staff, hey, what's going on with John? It's not just like he needs a report on Chuck, like an engineer would. What he's really asking for, perhaps, is the context of a there is a board meeting coming up in a few days, and I know from my reports that churn is actually spiking. I know for a fact this guy is the CEO, and he'll have to go defend it in that board meeting. So what I need to do is, and just when he just said, Hey, what's going on with John, he's actually really talking about preparing himself for that board meeting, right? And I know that from the context of hey, I like I heard from him. I know how he engages. And I also saw the context of that calendar invite, and I also saw the context of what the actual churn data even looks like, right now, right? Versus like I was an engineer and I was asking that same question. It's a more routine task, right? For the other context, it's a more fire drill sort of situation I need to get on this. I need to get people on a call, versus an engineer asking, Hey, routine check every week he checks in on churn and sort of reports back or something or the other, right? And so that is the sort of context that we want to get access to and be able to serve in that manner.
So awesome. So let me sort of pick an example, and sort of, I really need it with others. So I've spoken to a bunch of Chief of Staff. Have spoken to a bunch of founders executives. What I've realized is a Chief of Staff becomes very personal, and they are in tune with your needs specifically, right?

What I've realized is a Chief of Staff becomes very personal, and they are in tune with your needs specifically, right? So when my leader, let's say, is asking me as a chief of staff, hey, what's going on with John? It's not just like he needs a report on Chuck, like an engineer would. What he's really asking for, perhaps, is the context of a there is a board meeting coming up in a few days, and I know from my reports that churn is actually spiking. I know for a fact this guy is the CEO, and he'll have to go defend it in that board meeting. So what I need to do is, and just when he just said, Hey, what's going on with John, he's actually really talking about preparing himself for that board meeting, right? And I know that from the context of hey, I like I heard from him. I know how he engages. And I also saw the context of that calendar invite, and I also saw the context of what the actual churn data even looks like, right now, right? Versus like I was an engineer and I was asking that same question. It's a more routine task, right? For the other context, it's a more fire drill sort of situation I need to get on this. I need to get people on a call, versus an engineer asking, Hey, routine check every week he checks in on churn and sort of reports back or something or the other, right? And so that is the sort of context that we want to get access to and be able to serve in that manner.
S Speaker 314:51So one question here, now the biggest challenge that I'm seeing so, you know, like the Microsoft copilot product, yeah? Now tries to do some things like, like this. This morning, I was trying to draft an email with the use of copilot, and copilot now has tries to have context around everything within the company.

And then so I was drafting that email, and it automatically surfaced this context, that such and such person should I just CC that person as I draft this email and send that person that email out so that that person can also coordinate. Now, the big problem with that was that the it the it got context from the last year. And that's and that the challenge was

S Speaker 316:18in AI. It's an unsolved problem open. Ai hasn't solved it. Gemini hasn't solved it, entropic hasn't solved it, right? And this is where like context is like, this is what a good Chief of Staff, that's what he or she solves, right? Really. Well, they have all this context. They have all this memory, and I don't have to regurgitate anything. All I have to do is I have to say two or three things to this person, and it's automatically a good Chief of Staff will solve that context problem for me exactly. If I have to provide context all over again, then I don't have a chief of staff. How do you solve for that? Because that's
in AI. It's an unsolved problem open. Ai hasn't solved it. Gemini hasn't solved it, entropic hasn't solved it, right?

okay, really, when you start cracking enterprise,
okay, really, when you start cracking enterprise,
okay, really, when you start cracking enterprise,
S Speaker 337:27by then, at that point, I think you'll have to think through like some of the other agent tech, workflow automation tools. Will they be able to do the same as well? You know, because the IT organizations don't want to buy multiple tools, and there are, like, multiple ways to automate workflows, and this is one, one form of a workflow. You have to somehow build differentiation. But I think this is the right go to market plan. First, you prove it out with assemblies, right? Like, if you can prove that out, then you can keep adding more features, see how the models are evolving at that point as well, because the models will change. Models will solve a lot of it for you. Yeah, I
by then, at that point, I think you'll have to think through like some of the other agent tech, workflow automation tools. Will they be able to do the same as well?

S Speaker 239:08to sort of set up context, yeah, so first of all, thank you that this feedback, and this is why I think money is sort of primed me, like, Hey, you guys usually, typically do bigger investment. So I kind of knew that walking in. And so I appreciate that early feedback, and I appreciate all the conversations and the ideas that you have speaking about like, hey, enterprises don't want to buy multiple tools that do the same thing. We don't want to necessarily rebuild the thing, right? Like you said, llms are going to get better. We designed the system so that the LLM call is a commodity like, I could use Gemini or GPT or anthropic, or whoever is the best game in town in that moment. And that makes sense. I could even do an on device thing and on on premise, enterprise installation, if that's what the enterprise needs, right? That's the sort of game designing it that way. Because, like you said, some IT teams are going to be super, sort of stringent about what data lives there, what data goes out, and what not, and so perfectly fine building for that world when we are at in that state of our journey. And also we don't necessarily want to rebuild everything just from that same thing. There are tools out there that platforms are there. For example, I can use any time to automate a lot of these things, and it's already a blessed thing that already kind of works in your organization. We could use that, right? We don't want to rebuild the whole architecture ourselves. And so that is sort of our design motif. There's a small team we can only invest in so many areas. It's cheaper for us to leverage what exists out there to create value, immediate value, for the user right now, and go from there, and that's sort of the plan. And finally, on final code, on the strategy of like, hey, IT organizations. I think there's two sort of the most other AI, cheaper staff style companies right now. What they're doing is enterprise top down, right? The challenge with that is selling in for the very first time becomes really hard. You don't have proof of value. You're a small company. You just started stuff out. On the flip side, let's say I'm a small company. People are already using my free app in your company. I can go to you be like, hey, you know what? People are already using this. Let's say x hours every week. I can 10x that if you buy the enterprise plan, right? And that is a much more compelling sell than the other alternative, and that's sort of the path. That's sort of why I think plg is the only way you can quote, unquote, win or character space and that sort of wide bet you're going forward.
to sort of set up context, yeah, so first of all, thank you that this feedback, and this is why I think money is sort of primed me, like, Hey, you guys usually, typically do bigger investment.

And also we don't necessarily want to rebuild everything just from that same thing. There are tools out there that platforms are there. For example, I can use any time to automate a lot of these things, and it's already a blessed thing that already kind of works in your organization. We could use that, right? We don't want to rebuild the whole architecture ourselves. And so that is sort of our design motif. There's a small team we can only invest in so many areas. It's cheaper for us to leverage what exists out there to create value, immediate value, for the user right now, and go from there, and that's sort of the plan. And finally, on final code, on the strategy of like, hey, IT organizations. I think there's two sort of the most other AI, cheaper staff style companies right now. What they're doing is enterprise top down, right? The challenge with that is selling in for the very first time becomes really hard. You don't have proof of value. You're a small company. You just started stuff out. On the flip side, let's say I'm a small company. People are already using my free app in your company. I can go to you be like, hey, you know what? People are already using this. Let's say x hours every week. I can 10x that if you buy the enterprise plan, right? And that is a much more compelling sell than the other alternative, and that's sort of the path. That's sort of why I think plg is the only way you can quote, unquote, win or character space and that sort of wide bet you're going forward.
to sort of set up context, yeah, so first of all, thank you that this feedback, and this is why I think money is sort of primed me, like, Hey, you guys usually, typically do bigger investment. So I kind of knew that walking in. And so I appreciate that early feedback, and I appreciate all the conversations and the ideas that you have speaking about like, hey, enterprises don't want to buy multiple tools that do the same thing. We don't want to necessarily rebuild the thing, right? Like you said, llms are going to get better. We designed the system so that the LLM call is a commodity like, I could use Gemini or GPT or anthropic, or whoever is the best game in town in that moment. And that makes sense. I could even do an on device thing and on on premise, enterprise installation, if that's what the enterprise needs, right? That's the sort of game designing it that way.

Yeah, I agree. I think,
Yeah, I agree. I think,
S Speaker 341:44yeah, that's when you're thinking about the right way. That's how. I mean agree. I mean looking forward to your progress. I think, I think it would be good to touch base once you have good enough traction with SMBs, I would say, I think your 1.5 million ARR target, you should probably my recommendation would be, like the first 5 million ARR you get to with SMB
yeah, that's when you're thinking about the right way. That's how. I mean agree. I mean looking forward to your progress.

S Speaker 342:31the IT teams at enterprises. And there's going to be right now the IT teams at enterprises are all dealing with, Okay, how many AI tools do I need to enable so proving out. I mean, you do what superhuman did you do? What zoom did in early days, and you do what

S Speaker 342:58good luck, and I think let's touch base. Once you, once you have some meaningful workflows solved for SMBs and then proven product market fit in SMBs, I think that should be, I would make it for you, I would 24 months, 1.5 million ARR in this day and age, I would get more aggressive than that. That would be my feedback, which is, you're you're setting a low bar for yourself. So you have to set a higher bar. You have to set a 5 million ARR bar with SNB in 24 months, because this market otherwise is is going to, like, there's going to be lot of players in the automation market.
good luck, and I think let's touch base.

S Speaker 243:56Good call out. I mean, I think those numbers are kind of hard for me to sort of assert, right? But, like, honestly, I can see some of those levels very easily, right? Like, for me, if I move the conversion needle by like, point 5% I get way more users, right? I've been very conservative with the conversion rates of how many people I want to convert, but that good feedback I will sort of incorporate,

S Speaker 244:50No, that's good feedback. I mean, honestly, that's a number. I just like, this is the first time I'm presenting this version of the slide. I did not have those numbers, so it's good to hear from you. So I will, I will make sure that those numbers make more sense.
