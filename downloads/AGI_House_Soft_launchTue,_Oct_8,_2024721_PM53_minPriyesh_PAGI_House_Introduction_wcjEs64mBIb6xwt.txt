S Speaker 10:00Hacker houses and all that stuff. And it's exciting to see AGI house doing this. So props to AGI house. So we have one startup that's kind of coming out of stealth tonight, that is our startup, myself and three teammates are here to do that, and then we have two other really amazing startups who are going to demo their products tonight. So call it a demo night. Call it a self Startup Launch Party, but that's it, before we get into the demo. So Jeremy, do you want to give any thoughts? Yep,

0:43hello. Very nice.
S Speaker 20:47First and foremost, welcome to AGI house. So the intention very creative. You know you could live in a park, or you could ping a number of your entrepreneurial and researching friends to co rent a mansion in which you would invite the creators of all of the foundational technologies behind the intelligence age, Alec Radford, the inventor of GPT or Robin rumbach, the creator of stable diffusion to co build hundreds of AI projects that turn into dozens of companies and through which you have the most fun with the super intelligence revolution. And so we are 35 hackathons into what I frame as the intelligence age, this transition from primarily using human knowledge and intelligence through problem solving to using artificial intelligence. And so, for example, this Sunday, we're gonna be throwing this huge OpenAI and zoom hackathon, because OpenAI just released speech to speech, so you hear my voice here and now, but next year, this could, in fact, be a real time conversation powered by an artificial intelligence version of me, and it can actually, in many ways, replace human workers, become, you know, a conversational partner. I spend a lot of time talking to clones of Myself These Days, so we should basically be able to create incredible speech to speak experiences this weekend. And so the vibe of AGI house is the researcher, hacker, entrepreneur community co creating phenomenal novel inventions on the weekends for fun. And it's just been a joy. So thanks a lot for coming to enjoy it. So

S Speaker 33:40to do. How many of you here have heard about AI agents, I guess, on right. So we are building some part of the infra that enables it. Essentially, if somebody is building an AI sales agent, they would need to connect with their customers CI so that the agent can take action or get data from it, be it Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, etc. If somebody is building a support agent, they would need connection to ticket tracking softwares like Jira, Zendesk of the world, and that's what we provide, managed authentication, authorization and in a very agentic, friendly, function callable manner, with integration to all Lama, index, Lang chain, autogen, all the agentic frameworks you can kind of think of, obviously, OpenAI and cloud and like, if you had to do it yourself, it would have been a nightmare to read through all the docs figure out the authentication edge cases here and there. In our experience, even right now, AI can also figure it out. I would call it AGI, like AI is able to figure it out all the edge cases included in case of using composure, it's installing composure's library. Obviously you have to install open air or lancha, or whatever you're using. Then you can do it for yourself or for like your customer. In this case, I am giving it the power of GitHub. We have a GitHub tool. So it's like, like authorizing, like authenticating GitHub on your behalf, which is calling as simple as composure at GitHub. And

It's kind of importing composure tool set, adding GitHub to the tool set in natural language, you can do whatever a human can do on GitHub, almost everything you can do via natural language. So here I asked it to create an issue on my repository, title, test issue with body this, even if, I guess, remove this title

S Speaker 36:25this is our repo, by the way, please do star? We have around 9000 stars. And yeah, I think it should have created a issue. Yeah, we have aI Dev Tools demo issue with the description by God GPT. Just to give you an idea, we have, like, a bunch of tools. You can add your own tool as well. We have, like, as I mentioned, an open source repo where you can code and add tools we support directly, adding it via Open API spec. We have, like, right now, like, around 72 tools in GA but we have a lot internally. So if somebody wants a specific tool, we might have it in beta, and otherwise we have a very good SLA of adding a new tool. And you can create like agent to do whatever you do right now, hopefully, and because you are at ACI house, hopefully the next like, kind of whatever person like you are doing right now will be automated. We are like software engineering agent as well. By the way we are kind of reaching SOTA, hopefully reaching SOTA soon on three bands. So you can use those tools as well, like they are kind of like code indexing tool, code analysis tool, browser tools to build, like front end engineering agent, all of them supportive. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, I missed that, but I'm currently co founder of composio. You can reach me at Karina theory, composure Dev, if you have any queries and we have a discord for support in like the docs Section, docs dot, composure, depth,

S Speaker 413:55there'll be around 50 slots for everyone here and over the course the next couple of days. So superpower.com/max, and we have to get early access to everything you're seeing here. Yeah, the one thing I should say is about all this is going to a month, which is a far cry from $100,000 fingers here charging or $50,000 some of these longevity discharge, yeah, quick question, yeah, Brian's also love what he's doing with him. Any other
there'll be around 50 slots for everyone here and over the course the next couple of days. So superpower.com/max, and we have to get early access to everything you're seeing here.

S Speaker 515:04you have some deep medical research regarding, yeah,
you have some deep medical research regarding, yeah,
you have some deep medical research regarding, yeah,
you have some deep medical research regarding, yeah,
S Speaker 415:12is really challenging. It's the best of medicine. Isn't on the internet, it's not in medical textbooks. It's not on Google, it's not in chatgpt, in the brains of the best doctors around the country. The catch is, can't get into cinnamon. They charge hundreds of 1000s of dollars. So the thing we do is we bring together these best doctors, and we try to get their brains and put it into code right. We try to actually understand what are the protocols that are being applied to Larry Allison, what are they? So we work, we work with a lot of these top clinicians around the country. Many are advisors, many are investors, so we do a lot of that cool last question, then I'll wrap it up, and if you had your hand up, there's obviously a lot of other test companies out there. Are you going to

S Speaker 615:53Can I bring it into
S Speaker 416:01this? Bring it into this? Yeah, totally. So we don't want to own the land millions of tests out there, and that's a good thing, right? Like, when we see cool tests, we're like, oh, let's bring that into simple Our job is to take all of that data, take your past many records, take your wearables. Run that through our models, our algorithms, run that through our clinical model, and try to actually work out, what do we do about it? So in the context of every Well, yes, we can import past lab data. We can import past gut microbiome data and
this? Bring it into this? Yeah, totally. So we don't want to own the land millions of tests out there, and that's a good thing, right?

S Speaker 217:54welcome to omniscience. My name is Jeremy, and I am the founder and CEO of a knowledge generation company called omniscience. A quick raise of hands, who here believes that artificial intelligence will eventually take over knowledge creation? Wow. Very, few believers in the room. How about a more general question, who believes that it's possible for an AI to be creative? Creative? Okay, wow, lots of believers in the room. So until very recently, almost nobody believed what you believe? They do believe that out of a GPU could come a novel, and in our case, we create impossible books. What do I mean by impossible?

Know that a few enterprising folk at LinkedIn created this book on product management using omniscience, edited it lightly with a few images and finishing touches, and went to Best Seller status on Amazon. All that is to say that the future of deep and grounded generating writing is among us. So we do cited research papers. So I'm sure you've read a paper or two, seen a paper or two in the past. That is how we represent new knowledge.

welcome to omniscience. My name is Jeremy, and I am the founder and CEO of a knowledge generation company called omniscience. A quick raise of hands, who here believes that artificial intelligence will eventually take over knowledge creation? Wow. Very, few believers in the room. How about a more general question, who believes that it's possible for an AI to be creative? Creative? Okay, wow, lots of believers in the room.

S Speaker 222:38agree. Okay. Now, to be clear, these are products that are functional up and running. You can use them as a public but I do have a launch for you, which is an early peek into the automation of the generation of novel machine learning algorithms. Now for me, this is in the direction of the holy grail of machine learning, which is, can we use machine learning in order to improve itself? This question has stumped and inspired fear in so many researchers and intellectuals, and I have the privilege of launching a basic version of automated machine learning research to you today, I'll tell you how this works and how we were able to do it. So in our case, we took a body of classic machine learning algorithms like gradient boosted decision trees like k nearest neighbors, and we created a world of potential variants. So we really used search through the space of conceptual research algorithms. I'll give you an example of what I'm talking about. So this notebook has plenty of generative prompts, and I'll give you an example of one that worked incredibly well. It's called multi level abstraction, K nearest neighbors. So it turns out that if you force a model to output an algorithm in the style of Scikit, learn, the central, classic algorithm library, you can automatically test the algorithm by calling fit and predict with a suite of downstream data sets. And so you can know almost instantly whether the algorithm that you're generating is better or worse than the space of other algorithms. And this lets you search through a huge conceptual space of algorithms by having the CO generation model implement the algorithm and then evaluate it. And so this asks us to create a hierarchical K nearest neighbors that operates at multiple levels of abstraction, start with high level features for initial neighborhood selection and then progressively refine using more detailed features. This could capture both coarse and fine grain structure in the data. And giving this instruction to sonnet 3.5 it generated in a library that we're calling meta. I This abstractive K nearest neighbors algorithm, and there is a sort of M, multi level abstraction, K and M. So this is the code that the AI not only wrote itself, but that another AI proposed. So the initial proposal I just read to you was not written by me or another researcher. It itself was generated by a process that generates a space of machine learning algorithm hypotheses, and cleverly, they used principal component the AI chose to use principal components analysis with different numbers of components in an ensemble that I've never seen before. It's an ensemble of distinct compression levels and then train the K nearest neighbor algorithm on those distinct levels and aggregates the results in the style of an ensemble. And this model destroyed standard K nearest neighbors. So you can see the numbers on wine, on breast cancer, on digits on diabetes, on cover type on abalone. If you take the standard version of knives neighbors and compare it to multi level abstraction, multi level abstraction mostly destroys the benchmark. It gets clear almost perfect results on almost every benchmark that we had in our suite. And so this is an introduction to algorithmic generation systems and a new form of program synthesis. You know, you can see another body of the algorithms that we upgraded, decision trees, gradient boosting, support vector machines, logistic regression and Gaussian Naive Bayes and all of our generated variants. And because it's parallelizable, you can create tons of these, many of which dramatically outperformed their sort of standard examples. And so this is just a sneak peek into a totally new paradigm of machine learning progress, which goes from an idea of an algorithm created by an AI to an implementation to an evaluation to a novel library potentially filled with 1000s or 10s of 1000s of totally new machine learning algorithms never heard of before. That out before. So how are we going to evaluate the novelty of the algorithm? Well, the answer is something like research paper generation. How convenient that we can basically put our algorithm in the context of the rest of the research literature. So if I look to my research papers, I can see the liquidity of few lines, the morphophysological and behavioral analysis.

What a definition? How convenient, actually, as a definition, very clever anatomical adaptations such as flexible spine or retractable claws are quantified using biomechanical models, revealing a viscosity coefficient analogous to that of glycerol at 25 degrees Celsius. Behavioral patterns, including contortion during locomotion and equilibrium maintenance, are analyzed using fluid dynamical principles. Specifically the naphier stokes equations adapted for biological tissues, and it walks us through rho, representing density, mu, representing the velocity field, P, pressure and mu, the dynamic of viscosity. Now this entire paper is deeply cited, so I'll just jump you down to the bibliography. So mathematically heavy, but also we can see the sort of tremendous number of research papers on the frontier that are brought into this argument, which proposes a convenient but factual definition of what it means to be liquid and That pigeonholes cats into its form.

The second intention is that if you are a researcher and you want a customized literature review that does not exist, we can create it for you, plausibly at a level of quality that is superhuman. And if you're a researcher who wants to write up your research results. You can describe your results, or give the code base behind your results, or give the database and a command to execute to recreate your results to the system, and it will create the research draft for you, saving you tremendous amounts of time and rendering a huge fraction of your unpublishable work publishable because the reason it wasn't publishable is you didn't have time to write it up. But so many of these computer scientists are phenomenal coders and terrible writers, and we solve their problem. So

S Speaker 135:31and at my last startup, I came to terms with what that meant for my identity as a competent human being in this world, aka, I had a co founder who would make fun of me about it all the time. Because not only was it something that a very competent CEO should be able to do, you know, we should all get paid to Inbox Zero. You're the best at your job. You should totally be an inbox zero person, right? If you're not inbox zero, then you're not on top of your stuff. And it would cost us. It really costs us a lot of things. We missed investor meetings, we missed hiring opportunities, we missed a lot of stuff, and that's just kind of was something that I carried with me. And I figured, okay, this is a me problem. This is a Brett problem. Brett is not competent. Look at superhuman talking about get to Inbox Zero, like It's what we're all doing. Everyone around is getting to inbox zero, right? You get that feeling that it's everybody except you, right? And you suck because of it. And then I asked all my like, super, super smart, really successful founder friends. I was like, how do you guys get the inbox zero? And there's, like, they basically say Adderall. And I was like, All right, well, you know, what if I'm not taking Adderall? What if, you know, maybe a little bit, maybe, you know, no Adderall, no Zin, no. You know what's the sober way to get to inbox zero? And they're like, I just, I don't, I don't get to Inbox Zero. These are, like, CEOs of billion dollar companies, like, yeah, if it's important, they'll email me again. Yeah, I don't know, like my EA may figured it out, but she misses stuff too. So I felt like this was a problem, that we were basically gaslighting ourselves, saying, you we all suck for not getting into Inbox Zero. It's a skill issue. It's your fault, but nobody seems to be able to get there, right? So in my opinion, it's a tool issue, not a skill issue. And that became very clear when we started working on micro because GPT four came out. And if you think about what is email, email is the largest unstructured database that you personally have access to. Right? It's a system of record for your life, right? It knows where you where you've worked. It knows where you've traveled. It knows what bank you use, what healthcare you use. It knows that I'm a super, super powered user and early investor like it knows what investors are hitting you up saying we really want to invest in this company. Can you please generate more AI science papers for us? You know all of that information. Your email knows so much about you, but it is so dumb, right? It is so dumb you can't even find a flight that's tomorrow in your email, right? You can't find that flight. You can't find anything. So I felt like this is a problem that AI could uniquely solve, and so micro, what we've been building for the last year, by the way, this is our first anniversary of our web app codebase, commit. So first commit one year ago. So what we our vision for micro is basically to lean into this idea of email as a database, not a task list. Email is a database, not a task list. Every single everything else in the world basically says email is a task list you must action on every single thing we say, no, we want to extract and organize the most important information in your email so that you can actually visualize it in a interface that makes sense for you, right? So if you want to see your shopping as a Pinterest board, you can if you want to visualize your VC fundraise in a pipeline, you can all of that is there. So we're a year into this. We've started, and our vision is organized, so you don't have to be I believe that the last era of productivity is over. We call it brute force productivity. This is the era that the people who benefited most were the, you know, OC OCD, household born. People like the building a second brain. People like all these crazy, you know, these people on Twitter. We were like, I wake up at 6am and then I worked for three days straight. And, you know, all that stuff. We're all sick of them. Nobody is like that. 99% of people have, you know, stuff we want to do outside of work and all that stuff. So we think this era of brute force productivity is over. Micro is the new era. Micro is all about organizing your life so you don't have to you don't have to triage emails, you don't have to create tasks. You don't have to do any of this stuff. It just does it automatically. So with that, I'm going to show you my email, which is very personal, but here it is. So is this legible? Hopefully not, all right, so over the last year, we built basically the scaffolding and the infrastructure for a the baseline of this product. The most important thing, obviously, in your email, is the emails themselves. So you can see, you know, a list of all of these emails. What I personally like is that if you click into an email, you can see a nice little AI summary at the top of the email, if you don't want to read the whole thing, because they're very long, and then this whole thread was very long. So just today, we shipped this really cool feature that summarizes the whole thread for you, so you don't have to read the whole thing. It's there for you. These are what we call properties. So just like if anybody's used notion, notion has these cool little properties, you can create them for anything. You could do that in our product as well. Many of them are AI generated. Many of them you can in the future, you will be able to create AI generated properties. But the idea is that you can use these to sort and filter and create custom workflows on on top of email, if you want. But probably the nicest feature in email is the Tasks section. So some emails have tasks that are generated. So I didn't respond to this email, I apologize. So it says reply. This is an AI generated task, and then if I added that, it would show up in my handy little task management system, right? So you can see, you know, works like a normal task, and if you want to reference the original email that that task came from, it just shows up there, right? So that's kind of like the email task infrastructure. Something we also shipped today is LinkedIn integration. So basically, soon, you'll be able to sign sign into your LinkedIn, you'll be able to sign into your Twitter, DMS, all of those in one place, and eventually, eventually manage those all in one place, similar to like text.com but a little bit more actionable, because we'll be extracting AI summaries and properties and stuff on top of it. So but the really, the magical part of this product right now, the main thing that people really seem to like it for, is the fact that we extract, we will pull out every single company or person that you've interacted with and calendared an email in any of your email addresses. So you can see, I have three connected right here. This is my personal This is my company email. This is another company email. It's my personal email. Soon you'll have you can connect as many as you want. You can also have your team members join the workspace and connect all of their emails and then your you know that your contacts will basically be a sum of everybody that you have interacted with ever across all these email addresses, across your team's email addresses. So what that means, if I'm like, Who do I know at a 16 z, I can see immediately, okay, here three email addresses I've interacted with a 16 z over. I click in, I can see all of our emails together. I can see the people that I know at asext and z, so there's a lot of them. Asyx and Z has like 1000 people to work there.
and at my last startup, I came to terms with what that meant for my identity as a competent human being in this world, aka, I had a co founder who would make fun of me about it all the time. Because not only was it something that a very competent CEO should be able to do, you know, we should all get paid to Inbox Zero. You're the best at your job.

What if, you know, maybe a little bit, maybe, you know, no Adderall, no Zin, no. You know what's the sober way to get to inbox zero? And they're like, I just, I don't, I don't get to Inbox Zero. These are, like, CEOs of billion dollar companies, like, yeah, if it's important, they'll email me again. Yeah, I don't know, like my EA may figured it out, but she misses stuff too. So I felt like this was a problem, that we were basically gaslighting ourselves, saying, you we all suck for not getting into Inbox Zero. It's a skill issue. It's your fault, but nobody seems to be able to get there, right? So in my opinion, it's a tool issue, not a skill issue. And that became very clear when we started working on micro because GPT four came out. And if you think about what is email, email is the largest unstructured database that you personally have access to. Right? It's a system of record for your life, right? It knows where you where you've worked. It knows where you've traveled. It knows what bank you use, what healthcare you use. It knows that I'm a super, super powered user and early investor like it knows what investors are hitting you up saying we really want to invest in this company. Can you please generate more AI science papers for us? You know all of that information. Your email knows so much about you, but it is so dumb, right? It is so dumb you can't even find a flight that's tomorrow in your email, right? You can't find that flight. You can't find anything. So I felt like this is a problem that AI could uniquely solve, and so micro, what we've been building for the last year, by the way, this is our first anniversary of our web app codebase, commit. So first commit one year ago. So what we our vision for micro is basically to lean into this idea of email as a database, not a task list. Email is a database, not a task list. Every single everything else in the world basically says email is a task list you must action on every single thing we say, no, we want to extract and organize the most important information in your email so that you can actually visualize it in a interface that makes sense for you, right? So if you want to see your shopping as a Pinterest board, you can if you want to visualize your VC fundraise in a pipeline, you can all of that is there. So we're a year into this. We've started, and our vision is organized, so you don't have to be I believe that the last era of productivity is over. We call it brute force productivity. This is the era that the people who benefited most were the, you know, OC OCD, household born. People like the building a second brain. People like all these crazy, you know, these people on Twitter. We were like, I wake up at 6am and then I worked for three days straight. And, you know, all that stuff. We're all sick of them. Nobody is like that. 99% of people have, you know, stuff we want to do outside of work and all that stuff. So we think this era of brute force productivity is over. Micro is the new era. Micro is all about organizing your life so you don't have to you don't have to triage emails, you don't have to create tasks. You don't have to do any of this stuff. It just does it automatically. So with that, I'm going to show you my email, which is very personal, but here it is. So is this legible? Hopefully not, all right, so over the last year, we built basically the scaffolding and the infrastructure for a the baseline of this product. The most important thing, obviously, in your email, is the emails themselves. So you can see, you know, a list of all of these emails. What I personally like is that if you click into an email, you can see a nice little AI summary at the top of the email, if you don't want to read the whole thing, because they're very long, and then this whole thread was very long. So just today, we shipped this really cool feature that summarizes the whole thread for you, so you don't have to read the whole thing. It's there for you. These are what we call properties. So just like if anybody's used notion, notion has these cool little properties, you can create them for anything. You could do that in our product as well. Many of them are AI generated. Many of them you can in the future, you will be able to create AI generated properties. But the idea is that you can use these to sort and filter and create custom workflows on on top of email, if you want. But probably the nicest feature in email is the Tasks section. So some emails have tasks that are generated. So I didn't respond to this email, I apologize. So it says reply. This is an AI generated task, and then if I added that, it would show up in my handy little task management system, right? So you can see, you know, works like a normal task, and if you want to reference the original email that that task came from, it just shows up there, right? So that's kind of like the email task infrastructure. Something we also shipped today is LinkedIn integration. So basically, soon, you'll be able to sign sign into your LinkedIn, you'll be able to sign into your Twitter, DMS, all of those in one place, and eventually, eventually manage those all in one place, similar to like text.com but a little bit more actionable, because we'll be extracting AI summaries and properties and stuff on top of it. So but the really, the magical part of this product right now, the main thing that people really seem to like it for, is the fact that we extract, we will pull out every single company or person that you've interacted with and calendared an email in any of your email addresses. So you can see, I have three connected right here. This is my personal This is my company email. This is another company email. It's my personal email. Soon you'll have you can connect as many as you want. You can also have your team members join the workspace and connect all of their emails and then your you know that your contacts will basically be a sum of everybody that you have interacted with ever across all these email addresses, across your team's email addresses. So what that means, if I'm like, Who do I know at a 16 z, I can see immediately, okay, here three email addresses I've interacted with a 16 z over. I click in, I can see all of our emails together. I can see the people that I know at asext and z, so there's a lot of them. Asyx and Z has like 1000 people to work there.

But make it 10 times more powerful by giving you a knowledge graph underneath it of your you know, your contacts, your information, but as well as you know, global data of like, you know, what's Coinbase ventures, check size and all that stuff.

That's where the location of the people that you're interacting with. We're about to do LinkedIn and CrunchBase integration so you'll basically know who of all the people I've interacted with my email have raised money from go to or something like that. Yeah, external and then the internal side is, you know when this is coming, like the next month or so, but like when you get an email from a friend that says, Hey, I just moved to New York, here's my here's my new phone number. Also it'll update the field in your in that person's profile with the phone number and the location.

We're only onboarding founders right now because, you know, we built this really specifically to be killer for fundraising, killer for early founders and stuff. The nice part about this is, you don't need to give up your existing email client. It's compatible. It syncs with Gmail. So if you mark something as important in our product, it marks it important in superhuman, if you mark something done in superhuman, it marks it done in our product. So really, the way to think about this is, you know, it's a very, very powerful people search and CRM product right now on the roadmap is, you know, hopefully you'll use this instead of superintendent,

Smaller teams can ship more features faster, and we've built this in such a way that it's very easy for us to integrate really, really specific workflows for things. So for example, if we wanted to, I don't know how many investors are on the are in the audience, they have a lot of like limited partners that they work with, and they need to know data about them. So imagine if we integrated a data set for limited partners and built a workflow for deal flow, or LP pitching and stuff like that. So what I tell investors is this is going to replace virtually every single productivity tool. What I actually think we'll see right? So here's the launch video. Where's the announcement video? Oh, a little bit about launch. We are in stealth. We are basically going to come out of stealth in the next few days. This is the preview or whatever.
