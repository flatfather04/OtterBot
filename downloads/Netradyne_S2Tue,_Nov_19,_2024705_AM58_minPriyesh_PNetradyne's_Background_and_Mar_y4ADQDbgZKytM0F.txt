S Speaker 12:54excellent, yeah, so, you know, real quick, you know, a couple of things we we really like, and what we want to highlight is, you know,
excellent, yeah, so, you know, real quick, you know, a couple of things we we really like, and what we want to highlight is, you know,

excellent, yeah, so, you know, real quick, you know, a couple of things we we really like, and what we want to highlight is, you know,
S Speaker 13:09it's not, I believe it's a billion Carlos. It's changed 2020, something percent discount. Okay, yeah, no, I know that we originally discussed there was the last round was 850 and it's going to be a premium to that. So it's going to be a billion.
it's not, I believe it's a billion Carlos. It's changed 2020, something percent discount. Okay, yeah, no, I know that we originally discussed there was the last round was 850 and it's going to be a premium to that. So it's going to be a billion.

S Speaker 33:33Hasn't changed. There's always been the number in terms of the selling price of the secondary,

Hasn't changed. There's always been the number in terms of the selling price of the secondary,
S Speaker 13:38right? I think the only thing we mentioned last time was the valuation of SoftBank, which is where we anchor to that 850, number. So, yeah, it's a premium to that. It's a billion. Thanks, excellent. Yeah. So what do we really like about the the investment, about the company, one they're a leader in the space, especially when you're talking about fleet safety and video based solutions for the connected vehicle. It is a really large and growing market. The one thing to note about the market, and why it's very interesting, is video based solutions and commercial fleets today really are only 10% penetrated in the market, and that's the US market, which is the most advanced. So it's a large and growing segment in the overall fleet telematics and fleet management space. And then the market is large enough to hold many large players. It's not a winner takes all market, and we'll get into the competitive positioning, which was one of the larger discussion points from the stage one, on how we kind of view the market, how we segment the market, and where we think natural diamonds right to win is in the market, and what the overall opportunity is, pardon me for growth. Another thing is we really like the team, very strong team, engineering led organization. Avnish is a very strong CEO. They'll be working to continue to develop the team as they grow into other segments. They have very strong expertise and execution on the enterprise side, but we'll continue to grow the management team around mid market and continue to develop that muscle as well, but we like the team overall. And so we mentioned the strategic value, strong strategic value, and fit with Qualcomm, and we think that there is a very healthy return profile, you know, even though that this is a late stage investment, we still see, you know, 3x plus upside from here, kind of in our in our base case, which is fairly well pared back, and a lot of upside opportunity as well. So the big bet, really, in the space is that we believe Metro dine will continue to have kind of the right to win in the video fleet safety portion of the market. They're the leader in this space, and we believe they'll continue to execute on that. And an enterprise, there's a strong product market fit, we can see a path to $500 million revenues before a time of exit, which we believe will likely be an IPO, though there's other avenues as well, and that the company will continue to be able to create products and solutions that keep them competitive, not not only In video fleet safety, but in the overall connected vehicle market, of course, there's, you know, risks to this as well, and I think it was highlighted in the stage one abundantly and mainly it's upstream competitors big ice like motive and samsara come in into the space so that that's an area that's continuing to get increasingly competitive. And then, of course, you know, want to highlight the, you know, the macro risk we know, detro Dine, you know, is focused on, on fleet safety fleets. And you know, carriers, of course, are susceptible to macro trends we saw, you know, a number of years back, 2023 with increasing rates, those guys had business challenges. So just wanted to highlight the macro risks as well as we look at this market. Any quick questions before we jump into some of the questions and comments from from the stage one

But you know, you know, just to highlight, I guess, in 2023, right on the 900,000 carriers in the space around 30,000 went out of business when rates went up and things got challenging in the economy. So we don't really know where, where, kind of things can go with, right with the new leadership here in the US coming into place, and taxes and tariffs, so things might get challenging again.

S Speaker 110:32on the fleet management side? Yes, but that's more around ELD, electronic logging of driver data, so on the actual compliance side, currently, yes, on the video safety, no, not currently. But one of the drivers of adoption is the move to automation and digitization of the entire vehicle. Those used to be pen and paper based tasks, so as they started, you know, bringing these solutions on the fleet management side, it drove the adoption on the video side as well. Got

S Speaker 511:11it, got it. And do they plan to embed any other sensors? I mean, if you look at samsara, they are more of a connected operations platform, right, beyond just vehicle safety, right? So I'm just wondering if that's the roadmap, because that's what's giving some Sala that kind of multiples, I would imagine, because the markets are expand significantly,
it, got it. And do they plan to embed any other sensors? I mean, if you look at samsara, they are more of a connected operations platform, right, beyond just vehicle safety, right?

S Speaker 111:32correct? Yeah. And we'll get into that on the competitive position. If you could hold on to that for two seconds, I'll kind of, I'll break that down, the short answer is yes, and on both sides, adding additional sensors, both on the camera side, you know, front facing and driver facing cameras, but also adding more complete solutions to be in the in the fleet management side as well, to provide those workflows. I'll jump into that in a minute, because I think you touched on a on an important part when it comes to the competitive landscape. Great. Yeah. So overall, I think unsurprisingly again, the main feedback was around the competitive position and value proposition. Also some questions around exit, obviously, coming in at, you know, 1.25 pre money. What are the, you know, likely outcomes, and where can we go from here? So I'll touch on on those. And then, of course, on the you know, traction side, some of the dependence on Amazon, what the business model looks like going forward. So I'll just hop right into that from from here. So this, this line we used during the stage one. I just wanted to use it to set the stage on the competitive landscape, as an Irvine mentioned, you know, there's a broader segment when we're looking at Fleet Management. The parts I want to highlight is, kind of the market is segmented into a couple of different ways. One is around fleet safety, and the other is around operational efficiencies. Right? When we think of guys like samsara motive, who are the leaders in this operational efficiencies, they really have a broad suite of products, but they're really not thinking about the physical movement of of goods, and that's, you know, really kind of big part of their marketing collateral, as well as really understanding everything that goes into the operational side of the business, fairly strong in the workflows side of the business, the other half, or the other part of the market is around safety, and that's really where Netra, dime analytics Linux, who pioneered, kind of the, you know, video based fleet safety business back in the day, and that should die, kind of the, you know, newer gen two solutions. That's the market that that they're really going after. You know, fleet safety can be broken down as well. And this entire market can can be broken down as well. If you think of the different types of fleets out there, you know, there's service fleets. And you can think of service fleets as you know, people who get in a truck and go somewhere, and a lot of the value is, you know, attributed for those organizations are around, what happens for those workers, or for that business once those employees get there, and then there's transportation fleets, right? You can think of these guys as work for hire fleets or private carriers. The main part of those fleets, or the main value of those fleets, are getting people in goods from point A to point B. And that's really where Netra dine has its strongest presence, right? Because it's all around the driver is, is, you know, the biggest asset for those companies. So keeping those drivers safe is a big part of the culture and business for those for that slice of the vertical,
correct? Yeah. And we'll get into that on the competitive position. If you could hold on to that for two seconds, I'll kind of, I'll break that down, the short answer is yes, and on both sides, adding additional sensors, both on the camera side, you know, front facing and driver facing cameras, but also adding more complete solutions to be in the in the fleet management side as well, to provide those workflows.

So overall, I think unsurprisingly again, the main feedback was around the competitive position and value proposition. Also some questions around exit, obviously, coming in at, you know, 1.25 pre money. What are the, you know, likely outcomes, and where can we go from here? So I'll touch on on those. And then, of course, on the you know, traction side, some of the dependence on Amazon, what the business model looks like going forward. So I'll just hop right into that from from here. So this, this line we used during the stage one. I just wanted to use it to set the stage on the competitive landscape, as an Irvine mentioned, you know, there's a broader segment when we're looking at Fleet Management. The parts I want to highlight is, kind of the market is segmented into a couple of different ways. One is around fleet safety, and the other is around operational efficiencies. Right? When we think of guys like samsara motive, who are the leaders in this operational efficiencies, they really have a broad suite of products, but they're really not thinking about the physical movement of of goods, and that's, you know, really kind of big part of their marketing collateral, as well as really understanding everything that goes into the operational side of the business, fairly strong in the workflows side of the business, the other half, or the other part of the market is around safety, and that's really where Netra, dime analytics Linux, who pioneered, kind of the, you know, video based fleet safety business back in the day, and that should die, kind of the, you know, newer gen two solutions. That's the market that that they're really going after. You know, fleet safety can be broken down as well. And this entire market can can be broken down as well. If you think of the different types of fleets out there, you know, there's service fleets. And you can think of service fleets as you know, people who get in a truck and go somewhere, and a lot of the value is, you know, attributed for those organizations are around, what happens for those workers, or for that business once those employees get there, and then there's transportation fleets, right? You can think of these guys as work for hire fleets or private carriers. The main part of those fleets, or the main value of those fleets, are getting people in goods from point A to point B. And that's really where Netra dine has its strongest presence, right? Because it's all around the driver is, is, you know, the biggest asset for those companies. So keeping those drivers safe is a big part of the culture and business for those for that slice of the vertical,
S Speaker 215:14if I understood correctly, not so much the service piece, service fleet piece, correct?
if I understood correctly, not so much the service piece, service fleet piece, correct?
if I understood correctly, not so much the service piece, service fleet piece, correct?
if I understood correctly, not so much the service piece, service fleet piece, correct?
S Speaker 115:23What? So, yes, I mean, naturally, next time still has customers in that area, just the higher value proposition, right? If you're kind of thinking of who you're selling into, if you're selling to an operations guy who you know wants to know when the good got off the truck and where it's moving around is factory and kind of other parts of it, you know, there'd be asset tracking and a bunch of other things on the connected fleet side of the business versus, you know, just looking at the driver and his behavior, because he's, you know, doing 250,000 miles a year and keeping them safe on the road, right? So guys like some Zara mode, if they have very vertical solutions as well. So, you know, they have solutions for construction and mining and, you know, warehousing and all these things that really bridge all those workflows. So beyond just the just the cab, right, beyond just the truck,
What? So, yes, I mean, naturally, next time still has customers in that area, just the higher value proposition, right? If you're kind of thinking of who you're selling into, if you're selling to an operations guy who you know wants to know when the good got off the truck and where it's moving around is factory and kind of other parts of it, you know, there'd be asset tracking and a bunch of other things on the connected fleet side of the business versus, you know, just looking at the driver and his behavior, because he's, you know, doing 250,000 miles a year and keeping them safe on the road, right?

So beyond just the just the cab, right, beyond just the truck,
S Speaker 216:28got it, yeah, we heard last week just I think that probably COVID, it is one of the opportunities for them. Is this notion of service fee, for example, for electric utility companies, servicing electricity company, and actually show me what folks do in the past. Interesting. Thanks, excellent,

S Speaker 116:46yeah. And, you know, the market has evolved over the past. You know, five to seven years, it used to be a kind of single point of sale in any of these fleets, you know, regardless of its work for hire or private fleets, you know, you would sell it to the Chief Operating Officer now, now that now there's a number of different people who are buying solutions for, you know, for the for the vehicles themselves. So the markets broadened and kind of segmented itself as well. And there's a large segment that focuses on on fleet safety. Like I mentioned that many of these guys have Chief Safety Officers now, and and large programs based around safety,
yeah. And, you know, the market has evolved over the past.

S Speaker 117:31there's a question around pricing, and we'll kind of get into the details on on how netradyne positions itself in the market. But generally speaking, that you're dying, seeks to price itself at a premium to its nearest competitor. And we've seen, you know, based on on their traction and their win rates, which we'll also discuss, that they've been able to successfully, you know, command these premiums of 20% over their peers, and it's largely around the feature of safety. And to drill down just one level deeper, you know what is different about metrodyne solution than any others? One they are focused around fleet safety and camera solutions. So Linux and netradyne play largely in that market, but guys like samsara and motive, they have more limited solutions. Think of them as selling their fleet management solutions to customers and also offering video as part of that offering netradyne analytics are starting from the other end of the market right. They're selling fleet safety solutions to the market, and they're also able to sell some connected vehicle solutions to that same market. So ultimately, selling the same customer, but with different value propositions and starting from from different endpoints. Next time, tends to start on the premium level and focusing more on enterprise, where others you know, tend to focus more mid market and value based sales, and then try to move up market

S Speaker 619:20rich when. So basically, if nitrogen are going after the same cut, even though it's a bit different from customer perspective, are they going after the same customer profile? I mean, some saw right natural time

S Speaker 119:33at the end of the day, they will. It's, you know, segmented many different ways. But yes, I mean, there's, there's no doubt about it when, when they go to market, there's a handful of competitors they're going to run into. So netradyne, they see Linux and samsara most often, and that's been validated by a couple of the platform guys that we spoke to as well. When it comes to camera based solutions. It's generally natural dynamics. And if you're looking for all in one solutions, it's generally samsara that comes to it. Samsara is a bit of a different sale, because they are more of a closed ecosystem. And so some customers like that, that they're able to get an all in one solution for one customers. Others don't. It's also, you know, some same reason, Metro banks kind of getting into that all in one space as well. There are many enterprises that, you know, regardless of their value proposition, if, even if they're safety focused first, they do want a complete offering from from one vendor as well. So, yes, they they end up, at the end of the day competing for the same customer, but from becoming at it from from from different sides of the market. And do

S Speaker 620:53they have to replace them? I mean, if natural dyne so, I mean, is that a dine a blocked with the customer base of samsara, or they need to replace them, or that can be a different cell or different angle.

S Speaker 121:07Generally, if you're a samsara customer, you're not going to be buying Metro diamond solutions. There's other guys that are broader, like Geotab. Geotab has, I think, four to five times larger install base than guys like samsara, but some SAR is a closed solution, so they have a partnership with guys like Geotab, who will resell the solution into their vehicles. They're working on a combined offering as well, which we'll touch on in a little bit. But these are more open platforms, and they're, you know, done as kind of their reseller so they'll offer you a variety of solutions, similar to platform sciences, which netrodyne is partnering with, and who we've spoken with many times, and also for diligence on netradyne as well, where you can choose, you know your part of You know which camera based solution you want as well. So over there you can mix. Samsara does not mix. Well, this is

So over there you can mix. Samsara does not mix. Well, this is
S Speaker 322:12you think about, you think about the market. So Netra, that is targeting, or at least initially, is the enterprise, the high end of the market, and samsara is more mid market. Netrounds trying to go down market. They're also trying to penetrate the mid market. And Sam tower is trying to move up. So the position right now, Metro dimes kind of the premium enterprise play, but this mid market area, they're gonna they're gonna compete. So the bigger question for natural times, how successfully they can penetrate this mid market. That's how you think about the kind of overlap, if you will. That make sense?
you think about, you think about the market. So Netra, that is targeting, or at least initially, is the enterprise, the high end of the market, and samsara is more mid market.

S Speaker 228:42Okay, so, so just, it seems like curious, and I don't want to nitpick here, but motives, actually, so shows a strong so more than Linux, better than Linux, okay, I guess as soon as less than strong, any insights there, assuming, given that Linux was a, you know, security faced based solution. So I'm just curious,
Okay, so, so just, it seems like curious, and I don't want to nitpick here, but motives, actually, so shows a strong so more than Linux, better than Linux, okay, I guess as soon as less than strong, any insights there, assuming, given that Linux was a, you know, security faced based solution.

Okay, so, so just, it seems like curious, and I don't want to nitpick here, but motives, actually, so shows a strong so more than Linux, better than Linux, okay, I guess as soon as less than strong, any insights there, assuming, given that Linux was a, you know, security faced based solution.

So I'm just curious,
S Speaker 129:04yeah, yeah. So Linux, you know, I mean, they're an interesting company. They've been around for a long time. They're local here as well. They're private equity back. So they're, they've been a lot more focused on operational efficiencies versus kind of developing new tech. In fact, you know, in most competitive sales, netrodyne is winning 90x percent. I have the exact number, I think two slides down, but they are kind of more of a legacy ish solution, whereas motive has kind of come through the new generation, and it's doing a better job bringing new features to market, at least from what we've seen. So they've been a lot more progressive. Linux has been less progressive.
yeah, yeah. So Linux, you know, I mean, they're an interesting company. They've been around for a long time. They're local here as well. They're private equity back.

S Speaker 334:24Hey, rich, this chart shows the mid market is actually percentage of their businesses coming down over time. I mean proportion is coming down, right? That's what they are protecting price to me, okay, so So in 25 they see a lot of growth in enterprise, and enterprise remains flat ish in terms of percentage of revenue or AR, right? So the growth is very from international. Mid market is certainly growing, but the percentage is not going to claim

S Speaker 135:04interest, that's what, yeah, just because enterprise grows so much quicker, right? But it's, it's just a larger segment. There are bigger dollar values attributed to enterprise. So yes, as a proportion, you're correct. Enterprise grows quicker. Okay?
interest, that's what, yeah, just because enterprise grows so much quicker, right? But it's, it's just a larger segment. There are bigger dollar values attributed to enterprise. So yes, as a proportion, you're correct. Enterprise grows quicker. Okay?

S Speaker 335:22This chart surprised me a little bit. Okay, yeah,
This chart surprised me a little bit. Okay, yeah,
This chart surprised me a little bit. Okay, yeah,
This chart surprised me a little bit. Okay, yeah,
35:27yeah, this is consistent with the company's projection.

yeah, this is consistent with the company's projection.
yeah, this is consistent with the company's projection.
35:30Okay, all right,
S Speaker 135:35excellent, yeah, and I think, you know, to the previous point, I think what, what I wanted to show here is just their sales funnel very quickly both, you know, time to win both for enterprise and mid market. But the bigger part was really around the win loss that they've shown over the past 24 months. And I think the interesting thing is, of the trials that they've won. They are winning around 79% of enterprise deals, obviously not doing as well in mid market, but on head to head enterprise deals, where they see samsara and Linux, they're winning around 73% of the head to head enterprise deals versus samsara and 94 versus lytics. So these
excellent, yeah, and I think, you know, to the previous point, I think what, what I wanted to show here is just their sales funnel very quickly both, you know, time to win both for enterprise and mid market.

yeah. So they went, you know, qualified lead to trial and then trial to win.
yeah. So they went, you know, qualified lead to trial and then trial to win.
S Speaker 336:42Yeah. And do we understand, for instance, if they lose to, I'm sorry, let's say and the primary reason they're losing is because some have more encompassing solution. It's a price or something else.
Yeah. And do we understand, for instance, if they lose to, I'm sorry, let's say and the primary reason they're losing is because some have more encompassing solution. It's a price or something else.

S Speaker 136:59Only anecdotally. I haven't spoken, you know, we haven't spoken to a customer who's not chosen Metro diamond chosen samsara. But generally, it's, you know, their value based sales, right? They're kind of playing in a different segment of the market, leading in with connected vehicle and and and, you know, those are the the main reasons they like samsara is complete all in one offering. They just have a very robust offering.

S Speaker 337:32Okay, maybe it's something we should talk to their their main sales guy a little bit on the venture that side, just to understand we're not going to be able to interview 100 customers, but at least some sense of why they win and Why they lose. Yep, got it
Okay, maybe it's something we should talk to their their main sales guy a little bit on the venture that side, just to understand we're not going to be able to interview 100 customers, but at least some sense of why they win and Why they lose. Yep, got it

S Speaker 138:01all right, yeah. And so we're kind of getting to the any more questions on the competition or the business or business model. We're kind of getting close to the financial side. So I just want to make sure we address any of the other questions before we jump into the financials.
all right, yeah. And so we're kind of getting to the any more questions on the competition or the business or business model. We're kind of getting close to the financial side. So I just want to make sure we address any of the other questions before we jump into the financials.

S Speaker 539:09okay, thanks. A quick one on the tech stack, right? I'm just curious, you know, how does V llms The Vision llms that are coming in and getting adopted quite widely, impacting all of the work they've done over the years. Because a lot of the events that they would be highlighting, they would have trained their models, so on and so forth. A lot of that is getting commoditized due to the llms and Nvidia also launched vision civilization, which I believe they've open sourced as well. So I'm just curious, you know how, how modular is the stack that they've built, and over a period of time, does this market get commoditized to a certain extent because of the ability of the llms?

40:00Great question. Yeah, no, it's

40:02a very good question.

I'll have to come back to you on that one of my trick when, if you have kind of
I'll have to come back to you on that one of my trick when, if you have kind of
S Speaker 340:14Yeah. I mean, let me adjust this. Maybe at the high level we can ask Nish. Anyway, I think the stuff they do not try, they use a lot of training data, and lot of the training data is all from these cameras that's on the fleet. And the key is, you know, corner cases also, like if you want to stop light or red light and other things. So they do train a lot of videos on and then the inferencing, I think, mostly done on the camera itself. So whatever video l and m that comes, let's say, and, and if it's better than their solution, if it is better, they can certainly leverage it. So I don't see
Yeah. I mean, let me adjust this. Maybe at the high level we can ask Nish.

S Speaker 341:12and then for a new, new, let's say new player emerging. Now, you have samsara already. You have these guys. It is a like, like a new player comes in. They can certainly use the llms, but they still have to go talk to them. They still have to show their performance is better than natural. So I think natural dams gotta, gotta keep up their innovation, right? Tech companies, they have to, they have to, if this latest technology, they gotta figure out what use it. Yeah.
and then for a new, new, let's say new player emerging. Now, you have samsara already. You have these guys. It is a like, like a new player comes in.

S Speaker 541:41Yeah. Yeah, a modular stack. And I'm assuming the hardware also becomes a huge differentiator all the, you know, getting a system to work together, versus just starting the software layer,
Yeah. Yeah, a modular stack. And I'm assuming the hardware also becomes a huge differentiator all the, you know, getting a system to work together, versus just starting the software layer,

S Speaker 341:52yes, yes, yes, that that has to the whole thing has to work ultimately, right? The accuracy has to be high. And, yeah, yeah. So I think that's yeah, that's my high level,
yes, yes, yes, that that has to the whole thing has to work ultimately, right? The accuracy has to be high. And, yeah, yeah. So I think that's yeah, that's my high level,

S Speaker 142:08yeah. And on the data side, I think, you know, one of the interesting points is, since these guys have been in operation for a long time, and they're one of the few with always on cameras, they've also amassed one of the largest data sets, right? So to get the data set to try to train on to build those llms. Might not be as straightforward as it sounds, but we'll definitely ask the question on how modular it is. It's a good question.
yeah.

That's your question. Michelle. Oh,
That's your question. Michelle. Oh,
That's your question. Michelle. Oh,
S Speaker 344:20do you want to have your details in terms of Exactly, yeah, no,
do you want to have your details in terms of Exactly, yeah, no,
do you want to have your details in terms of Exactly, yeah, no,
do you want to have your details in terms of Exactly, yeah, no,
S Speaker 744:25yeah. For that part. For that part, it's okay. And I think the second part of the question, just like when you look into the top 10 customers, do you know how many of them use the Geotab? Because as netrodyne wants to replace Geotab with their platform solution, I can assume that the Geotab is probably trying to do the same, so just trying to measure the risk.
yeah. For that part. For that part, it's okay. And I think the second part of the question, just like when you look into the top 10 customers, do you know how many of them use the Geotab?

S Speaker 144:49Yeah, thanks, sorry, I forgot that latter piece. So driver one is a early platform. They only have around 5000 installations. These are all Geotab customers today. I
Yeah, thanks, sorry, I forgot that latter piece. So driver one is a early platform. They only have around 5000 installations. These are all Geotab customers today. I
Yeah, thanks, sorry, I forgot that latter piece. So driver one is a early platform. They only have around 5000 installations. These are all Geotab customers today. I
Yeah, thanks, sorry, I forgot that latter piece. So driver one is a early platform. They only have around 5000 installations. These are all Geotab customers today. I
S Speaker 345:00think these questions richies. Question is, this is Amazon, use Geotab? I think the answer is, no,
think these questions richies. Question is, this is Amazon, use Geotab? I think the answer is, no,
think these questions richies. Question is, this is Amazon, use Geotab? I think the answer is, no,
think these questions richies. Question is, this is Amazon, use Geotab? I think the answer is, no,
S Speaker 145:06no, I don't Yeah, I will ask. I don't believe, Oh, I see naturalized customers. Yeah,
no, I don't Yeah, I will ask. I don't believe, Oh, I see naturalized customers. Yeah,

S Speaker 345:12that's your question, right? There existing, do they use Geotab? Yeah, I don't know. When you
that's your question, right? There existing, do they use Geotab? Yeah, I don't know. When you
that's your question, right? There existing, do they use Geotab? Yeah, I don't know. When you
that's your question, right? There existing, do they use Geotab? Yeah, I don't know. When you
S Speaker 745:17look into the top 10, like United rentals, skincare and audio, or do just trying to understand the overlap. We
look into the top 10, like United rentals, skincare and audio, or do just trying to understand the overlap. We
look into the top 10, like United rentals, skincare and audio, or do just trying to understand the overlap. We

45:26can ask question. I don't know the answer to that one, yeah, my

S Speaker 145:28guess is yes. Okay, I don't have, I couldn't tell you proportionately, okay.

S Speaker 145:40Uh, we believe they will. We don't. There's nothing in market yet, and we don't have any, you know, hard data around that. But yes, you can kind of expect each of these guys to whether they develop their own or partner with others, right? Geotab is a platform that integrates with many camera vendors as well. So they may develop their own overtime, but right now, their strategy is partnering with guys like Linux and metrodyne and others. But yes, if metrodyne is successful kind of coming down. You can see these guys also being similar to samsara motive and coming up as well,
Uh, we believe they will. We don't. There's nothing in market yet, and we don't have any, you know, hard data around that.

right? We have less than 10 minutes left. Oh, let's go. Got it.
right? We have less than 10 minutes left. Oh, let's go. Got it.
S Speaker 146:33So I guess we don't have to spend too much time on this is just basically saying most of the, or 60% of the incremental ARR is coming from new logos next year, there's a lot of expansion. We're at 200 million ARR today, looking to grow, you know, around 50% year over year, at least from in the management case, and much of that 60% of it will be from new logos. So true expansion.
So I guess we don't have to spend too much time on this is just basically saying most of the, or 60% of the incremental ARR is coming from new logos next year, there's a lot of expansion.

S Speaker 247:02So how does the pipeline look? Do we feel good about them growing at 60% from new customers?
So how does the pipeline look? Do we feel good about them growing at 60% from new customers?
So how does the pipeline look? Do we feel good about them growing at 60% from new customers?
So how does the pipeline look? Do we feel good about them growing at 60% from new customers?
S Speaker 147:13with that. I guess I'll just jump into our slides and our projections. I think you know when we're taking a look at the win rates and looking at the pipeline overall, we took it down quite a bit, mainly to say, you know, in in mid market, they won't be winning as much, and fleet management will not grow as quickly. But on the fleet safety side as well, we were a lot more conservative with with the with the win rates, you know, taking it that closer to 40% of new incrementally, or our new logo, Arr, there's a lot of of ARR already being booked that actually wasn't accounted for in there. They got an additional win from Amazon that will that's not in these numbers as well that will increase that Arr, but on the new ARR side, we've been a lot more conservative in that approach. And even going forward, you can see we kind of essentially held their plan back around 18 months.
with that. I guess I'll just jump into our slides and our projections.

S Speaker 348:20Average the OPEX number you show here, does that management?
Average the OPEX number you show here, does that management?
Average the OPEX number you show here, does that management?
Average the OPEX number you show here, does that management?
S Speaker 248:28Yeah, in general, the lines after I had this comment on the IC slides, I don't see the OPEX for management in the top portion. So,
Yeah, in general, the lines after I had this comment on the IC slides, I don't see the OPEX for management in the top portion. So,
Yeah, in general, the lines after I had this comment on the IC slides, I don't see the OPEX for management in the top portion. So,
Yeah, in general, the lines after I had this comment on the IC slides, I don't see the OPEX for management in the top portion. So,
S Speaker 148:38yes, so 24 is fixed, consistent for both 25 the top lines we reduced, but OPEX is pretty close. I think, I think it's like 134, or something like that, for for management. So slightly, we are more conservative on OpEx. Basically they're going to spend the money that they said they're going to spend this year. Is typically the way I look at 25 plans going forward. Going forward yet, going forward is going to be less than management plan, because they're not growing as quickly. So they'll, you know, kind of have a reset at the end of 2025 come out with the board approved plan and, you know, get the right OPEX number going forward, so it won't it's not as high as the management's plan for 26 and 27
yes, so 24 is fixed, consistent for both 25 the top lines we reduced, but OPEX is pretty close. I think, I think it's like 134, or something like that, for for management.

S Speaker 349:26we can we show that so that at least I understand what, how much we're cutting? You got it? Yeah, but I understand we need to maybe reduce temper a little bit, but hopefully we're not cutting as drastically as we're cutting the revenue the top line
we can we show that so that at least I understand what, how much we're cutting? You got it? Yeah, but I understand we need to maybe reduce temper a little bit, but hopefully we're not cutting as drastically as we're cutting the revenue the top line

S Speaker 149:45I will show you the follow up with the numbers. Okay,
I will show you the follow up with the numbers. Okay,
I will show you the follow up with the numbers. Okay,
I will show you the follow up with the numbers. Okay,
S Speaker 349:50yeah, so it sounds like we're reducing, but not as drastic as the top line reduce proportionally,
yeah, so it sounds like we're reducing, but not as drastic as the top line reduce proportionally,
yeah, so it sounds like we're reducing, but not as drastic as the top line reduce proportionally,
yeah, so it sounds like we're reducing, but not as drastic as the top line reduce proportionally,
S Speaker 149:55right? Like as a percentage of sales, it's going to be a similar weighting, but it's going to be lower, because our overall revenues are lower. I'll get you. I'll get you though,
right? Like as a percentage of sales, it's going to be a similar weighting, but it's going to be lower, because our overall revenues are lower. I'll get you. I'll get you though,

S Speaker 250:05you know Rich this assumes you have a just as efficient sales are. What often happens is you have an inefficient sales work, right? So you have a lot of people not driving enough revenue. So
you know Rich this assumes you have a just as efficient sales are. What often happens is you have an inefficient sales work, right? So you have a lot of people not driving enough revenue. So

50:20just, just, just that comment, right? That was,
just, just, just that comment, right? That was,
just, just, just that comment, right? That was,
just, just, just that comment, right? That was,
S Speaker 650:28I'm just saying, in many cases, we just put the OPEX in line with the management. Maybe here it's a bit challenging, because when the no, it's actually, I mean, the OPEX and the revenues are so high, so you can keep it the same, maybe it's create some issues, yeah, but they agree that, you know, there needs to be a proportion. Usually we put, we don't put us really a mild reduction in objects. We assume the cell is going to be lower. The obvious is going to be pretty much the same, maybe lower as well, but not in the same proportion.
I'm just saying, in many cases, we just put the OPEX in line with the management.

The obvious is going to be pretty much the same, maybe lower as well, but not in the same proportion.
51:00Yeah, basically,
S Speaker 151:02since we have a whole year of 25 I basically said that's the management plan for the year, we'll keep that OPEX going forward if we need to adjust OPEX, right? You kind of, you know your your scale, it could be higher, but I'll get you the right numbers and we can figure out if it's, if it's the right level. Because, based on this case, they're still only spending half of the cash that they're raising in this round, and they still have cash on the balance sheet. Yeah,
since we have a whole year of 25 I basically said that's the management plan for the year, we'll keep that OPEX going forward if we need to adjust OPEX, right? You kind of, you know your your scale, it could be higher, but I'll get you the right numbers and we can figure out if it's, if it's the right level.

S Speaker 351:30and Carlos, did he answer your question about pipeline so forth, or not originally?
and Carlos, did he answer your question about pipeline so forth, or not originally?
and Carlos, did he answer your question about pipeline so forth, or not originally?
and Carlos, did he answer your question about pipeline so forth, or not originally?
51:35I mean, not really
S Speaker 251:39in general, it's an assumption, right? I don't think it doesn't sound like we've gone typically, we do a better exercise in just trying to validate that that pipeline, the likelihood of reaching those numbers, is higher, right, especially for the first year, is harder for the second. But, you know, we just did this with Crest, right? Last week. Yeah,
in general, it's an assumption, right? I don't think it doesn't sound like we've gone typically, we do a better exercise in just trying to validate that that pipeline, the likelihood of reaching those numbers, is higher, right, especially for the first year, is harder for the second.

But, you know, we just did this with Crest, right? Last week. Yeah,
S Speaker 351:59yeah. I think Richard look at it. I think he just didn't explain it. This, this, I think this one, right? We looked at pipeline for next year, right? But we
yeah. I think Richard look at it. I think he just didn't explain it. This, this, I think this one, right? We looked at pipeline for next year, right? But we
yeah. I think Richard look at it. I think he just didn't explain it. This, this, I think this one, right? We looked at pipeline for next year, right? But we
yeah. I think Richard look at it. I think he just didn't explain it. This, this, I think this one, right? We looked at pipeline for next year, right? But we
S Speaker 152:07did look at the pipeline for next year, yeah. And, I mean, we haven't spoken to each of the these customers, so we still have some dd to do or speaking with a couple. But no, I mean, we didn't, you know, kind of go through customer by customer. We spent time with the pipeline to understand it, but we haven't yet done a dozen calls here.
did look at the pipeline for next year, yeah. And, I mean, we haven't spoken to each of the these customers, so we still have some dd to do or speaking with a couple. But no, I mean, we didn't, you know, kind of go through customer by customer. We spent time with the pipeline to understand it, but we haven't yet done a dozen calls here.

S Speaker 352:33So for example, based on when you looked in the pipeline, assuming I understand,
So for example, based on when you looked in the pipeline, assuming I understand,
So for example, based on when you looked in the pipeline, assuming I understand,
So for example, based on when you looked in the pipeline, assuming I understand,
S Speaker 152:40you have, yeah, Schneider. We know Schneider is coming in. That's very close, right? So we attribute higher proportion to some of these guys. Same with CR England. There's a couple of guys here that, you know, we kind of know, and some of the larger opportunities, because these are the top 10 customers, right? So kind of, you know, pretty comfortable around, we know the, you know, half is coming from existing customers. The other half, we're comfortable with half of that, or a larger percentage of that, right? So that's kind of the way we we build it.
you have, yeah, Schneider. We know Schneider is coming in. That's very close, right? So we attribute higher proportion to some of these guys. Same with CR England.

53:17You know, thinking of next year,
You know, thinking of next year,
You know, thinking of next year,
You know, thinking of next year,
S Speaker 353:19so that so the AR growth next year, you're saying half the percent, sorry, 50% from existing customer expansion, is that right? And then the other half from new customer 6040, but yes, okay, 60% expansion, 40% new low load. Correct? Other way around. Other way. 40% expansion, 60% new low correct?
so that so the AR growth next year, you're saying half the percent, sorry, 50% from existing customer expansion, is that right? And then the other half from new customer 6040, but yes, okay, 60% expansion, 40% new low load. Correct? Other way around. Other way. 40% expansion, 60% new low correct?

S Speaker 153:44So the expansion we're comfortable with, like I said, there's a lot of surprises in there. Already. We've seen Amazon come in and react. So the expansions are solid opportunities. It's the new logos that we really kind of focused on. And of the new logos we know guys like Schneider and sent us are extremely close. Those are just, you know, kind of we're like at the documentation stage.

So the expansion we're comfortable with, like I said, there's a lot of surprises in there. Already. We've seen Amazon come in and react. So the expansions are solid opportunities. It's the new logos that we really kind of focused on. And of the new logos we know guys like Schneider and sent us are extremely close. Those are just, you know, kind of we're like at the documentation stage.

S Speaker 154:36but you know, I just wanted to kind of highlight here. I took down from the stage one are our projections even further. I tuned down the growth and for the exit analysis, I also tuned down our multiple this is after speaking a same year. They're generally a little more conservative on their multiples. I was looking at the kind of midpoint, the vertical SaaS companies, I think it's fair to be kind of, you know, that closer under the higher end of the telematics companies and the lower end of the vertical second companies, just to be conservative, there's been a lot of you know, Both private, public, transactional space, the notable high benchmark is samsara, which trades at more like 20x but there's also a number of telematics players who trade sub double digits in the seven to 8x so pretty conservative on the way we approach the revenue. If they can hit 400 to 500 million in revenue, we're still looking at about a 3x on its return profile here, and this is not on a blended, blended primary and secondary basis. It's just 13 million at 1.35
