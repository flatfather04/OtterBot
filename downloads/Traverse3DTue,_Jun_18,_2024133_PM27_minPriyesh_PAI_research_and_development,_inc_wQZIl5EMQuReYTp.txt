S Speaker 10:00vegetation etc. And it will actually go automatically identify where that is in that 3d scene. And we did that a bit. So you it's hard to see but this is the raw RGB video for my Honda. And then I'll show you the 3d asset here in a second. And the idea is that we're just going to enable them to upload their own documents and then upload the 3d or the video and then you're able to create the 3d asset which is what you see there and you can talk with both at the same time you have the model has an understanding of both the 3d scene and the the the documents and so it can walk you through the inspection it can highlight certain things for you, etc. And again, we're still building this out but this is this. Okay,

S Speaker 20:41so this is you took a video call. How long did it take you to render this like
so this is you took a video call. How long did it take you to render this like
so this is you took a video call. How long did it take you to render this like
so this is you took a video call. How long did it take you to render this like
S Speaker 10:5140 minutes? Yeah. 20 minutes. Yeah, well claimants it's crazy. It's only gonna get I
40 minutes? Yeah. 20 minutes. Yeah, well claimants it's crazy. It's only gonna get I

can actually pull it off scions planning based on this.
S Speaker 11:03Yep, definitely planning based. Okay, yeah, there's so my co founder and he's been in some pretty advanced courses and we can show you we can send you one of the projects he did for the course where he was working on optimizing, Gaussian sliding. And then we've actually come up with of course, we were both in which is natural language processing with deep learning is more of a 3d understanding understanding portion and we can send you we can send you a bunch of stuff about the work we've

S Speaker 12:27Yeah, absolutely. And that's exactly it. There's there I mean, just Oh, my gosh, the the research philosophy on this has just been tremendous. And so we're, a lot of it is just us. Like scope and trying to understand the new techniques that are coming out in newspapers and then to them in the product. I mean, we're talking 20 minutes and there was it's a splat just came out and it is getting
Yeah, absolutely. And that's exactly it. There's there I mean, just Oh, my gosh, the the research philosophy on this has just been tremendous. And so we're, a lot of it is just us.

S Speaker 13:00Yeah, just in like 47 seconds, I think was the if the
Yeah, just in like 47 seconds, I think was the if the
Yeah, just in like 47 seconds, I think was the if the
Yeah, just in like 47 seconds, I think was the if the
S Speaker 23:05organizer for Bitcoin or endgame. That
S Speaker 13:08must be Yeah, but like, the other interesting thing about this is that it's time to compute this. Exactly. And so in computers just getting better because of this boom in AI. So this is like a very unsung technological advancement that I don't think enough people really understand the ramifications of this.

S Speaker 23:41know, personally, I believe that in this thesis, along with the thesis in computer vision, I have diseases and compute as well, which is the next decade or two decades, you're just going to see a significant moment of pure because of all this all the research velocity that is happening in AI that is needing to go and compute. Now we're still you know, I was talking to another great researcher and another upfiring last basic, geometric deep learning this morning. And he was telling, he was telling me that, you know, we're going to be compute, if anything, we're going to be compute bound at noon talking more about transformers because essentially synthetic data is going to be there's going to be a need for significant amount of synthetic data. And guess what, everybody has already scraped away and for all the data that was available, so the data that you can create now, in the language domain, not like it's like very excited about the video three, image work, but the language all that has been exhausted so you will be bound by so when we're doing b, we think the same. Now we're building heavy our roadmap is heavily going to be built around running most of the compute on device on edge totally is the sort of cost arbitrage that you're going to be able to have to be able to run it on the edge is is where our bets are. And I think that you're going to have I don't think it's going to be one versus the other. I think the word will be hybrid. But that's where we're spending so we're very excited to run a lot of stuff that you're building actually run it on the device because we're on the cloud if you don't want to.

S Speaker 27:27So So, so right now, the companies that you have listed over here, a lot of parts of their businesses today is 3d reconstruction. Is that, yes. Like this company, which has $6.4 billion, and I haven't heard of them that says that their core part of their business is 3d reconstruction.

S Speaker 17:50Sorry, was that huge businesses who want to go back and show this actually isn't systems. We are the 3d experience company. And they do a lot of like digital twins and infrastructure inspection, manufacturing and things like that. But yes, these are companies that are that are completely kind of predicated on the idea that 3d is going to be that that next new modality would say Bentley is another one that actually will go straight to it and that are focused on capturing 3d spaces. Capturing 3d for surveying for geospatial all of this, and we don't see the demand for these types of capabilities going anytime soon. I think that there's there's definitely some distinctions you have to draw between. There's so many nuances here. There's like what is engineering ready like right now? godson splatting, you've just read RGB you do not have the capability to get a true like survey grade quality like sunset meter accuracy, that they could potentially get there from raw computer vision but there's a lot I get, you know, as well as I do that like it's just a hard problem. Like I remember, you know, truncated Zionist instructions, like it's really difficult to get this done, you know, accurate, and then, but RGBD couldn't be able to get that they need it's like what is CAD enabled? What is What can you put into unity and what can you mash? And put in Unreal, like, there's so many different pieces of the 3d market pie to go after here. But right now we're sitting we're sitting more individual length in the visualization domain and then in the semantic 3d Understanding domain, and you can apply that 3d scene understanding to really, you can apply it beyond Gaussians planning. And actually one of the papers we'll send you we did it straight with point clouds on what was called the scan that dataset. But not to get too deep down the rabbit hole. It's just yeah, there's a lot of opportunity, but it it's a very it's a very nuanced market. And all of these are either virtual training, or some type of simulation or 3d reconstruction.

S Speaker 210:15Now Wow. Some Yeah, I guess there'll be parts that you can address. Yeah, we won and then as you grow the company, and you can I mean, Dassault will be companies like all these public companies are probably not even thinking of nurses. Certainly we've got students bladder.
Now Wow. Some Yeah, I guess there'll be parts that you can address. Yeah, we won and then as you grow the company, and you can I mean, Dassault will be companies like all these public companies are probably not even thinking of nurses. Certainly we've got students bladder.

S Speaker 110:39We we just did those two things. God, I know that we're well over. One more question before

S Speaker 210:58Yeah. Janessa so you're in the right I remember you were saying mission man. So the reason why I ask is UX theater one of the things that each and every one of these companies might guess I can even look at the logos and I can tell you that they have cumbersome. UX is to these were built in the 90 within the state and then That's right. So the disruption that San Francisco brings to all of this is best in class pack best in class UX. So do you have somebody in the team that is that is paying attention to this because what if I can you know a lot of times when I talk to a lot of customers in the space, they're really happy when a startup is disrupting any one of their spaces. They're like, Oh, you know what, I had to click on 10 buttons to do this before, but now I can just click on one button. And guess what? That's going to save a significant amount of time. Yeah. For existing people. But not just that it's going to save significant amount of time to train young people who can use these things. And
Yeah. Janessa so you're in the right I remember you were saying mission man.

S Speaker 112:051,000% I would say that, to be honest, that person is me. I am very much the I would say the most product oriented of the team and I think that just goes by virtue of me having been an end user for a lot of things for a while. It's like okay, I need to be I would need to make sure that my one year old fresh out of high school machine gunner or dude there's way less can actually utilize this this tech and it's not to say we is it a very artistic person. So he's definitely able and willing to do it as well. But he is much more focused on the 3d instruction, things and that is exactly, exactly. And we're a team of five so we're really slim right now and we don't have the capacity yet for a designer but I see what I think you see as well and that is UX is a it's a differentiating factor and it is it is I think it can be can't overcome just like for utility and every case, but man can absolutely even if you've got the best product in the world, if I don't know how to use it, or I can't use it or I don't like using it that isn't there, you're not going to have adopted and so I don't need to be Steve Jobs with exactly how I'm going about like being ruthless about the user experience. But that is something that we're absolutely focused on from day one and we do want to hire a designer and then in a very short term,
1,000% I would say that, to be honest, that person is me. I am very much the I would say the most product oriented of the team and I think that just goes by virtue of me having been an end user for a lot of things for a while. It's like okay, I need to be I would need to make sure that my one year old fresh out of high school machine gunner or dude there's way less can actually utilize this this tech and it's not to say we is it a very artistic person. So he's definitely able and willing to do it as well. But he is much more focused on the 3d instruction, things and that is exactly, exactly. And we're a team of five so we're really slim right now and we don't have the capacity yet for a designer but I see what I think you see as well and that is UX is a it's a differentiating factor and it is it is I think it can be can't overcome just like for utility and every case, but man can absolutely even if you've got the best product in the world, if I don't know how to use it, or I can't use it or I don't like using it that isn't there, you're not going to have adopted and so I don't need to be Steve Jobs with exactly how I'm going about like being ruthless about the user experience. But that is something that we're absolutely focused on from day one and we do want to hire a designer and then in a very short term,

S Speaker 114:02don't completely agree. I also it's on I think it's with the boom independence. Step right now and when they part of that boom is that you know, it's really hard. It was hard for me in the military to go I would put my phone I use Google to get to work and but due to Audible and having great experiences going to work I put my phone in the locker and into the skin and then I would take 20 minutes to boot up my computer and everything was dropped in like 1995 You know what I mean? Millennium edition. It was awesome. And so you have some software that's coming out these new defense companies that are really capitalizing on like, your defense customer comes down and they they understand what your experience is because they have it all the time.

S Speaker 115:30Nothing important, I'm sure. But to close this out. Like we talked about, you know, you talk about the the end of internet data and going to like when you can start to pull information directly from 3d data. I mean, that's where we're going. That is the vision that we asked. So just what I couldn't be smiling more when you when you sit down, but that's like, Okay, did you didn't make that slide. But that's exactly where we're going. I mean, that is what excites us. Why, like, you know, it's been easy to talk with people about this to get engineers excited, because, I mean, everyone sees this bottleneck. that's occurring. We're talking about it for, you know, for web scraping, and like we'll have we'll have a lot more like you talked with the team and open AI has come out by July 15. The spatial intelligence talk is something that we talked about as a team. You also have the like opening I sorta team is talking about how we're gonna have a lot of video data for quite some time, we can go a long way with the video data. But when you want to start really getting spatial intelligence with this, the physical relationships of where everything is at and even then, like when you're training sore and these other devices they're using Unreal. They're using 3d information in order to do this. And we definitely think that like, being able to just have the world be that data source is is the future and that's that's, it's got pretty excited,

S Speaker 217:16that but not so, funding wise, how much have you raised and then where are you in terms of like you talked about military training as one of the Golden monoterpenes and then the other one is, I'm guessing you're already so have you tried to sell to mining yet or not yet?

S Speaker 117:32So we're like right there with it. We actually were talking about Francesco. We've got some meetings that are with bhp. We did some market analysis on this and did some outreach, and they love it. And then they would do it for a survey and then remote site management, but think I might have a version of this. This is not ours. This is what I'm actually speaking with and again on Wednesday, we're trying to hire this guy. He just built a viewer for Gaussians flat two in rusts like by hand like over the last like a couple of months so I want him on the team but being able to do basically remote site management and understand if the, the mind is progressing as you would like in high fidelity photo realism. That is, I think the like initial use case for mining, but then on top of that you still have like some very real needs they have so they we identified that they really want to do 3d Crack detection. So like being able to send a device either subterranean or even. Like it will strip mines there is the need to just understand what if there is a crack in the state for personnel and being able to send a drone in or like you have an autonomous system they can send in and capture that to 3d and you don't get the fidelity that you need with traditional photogrammetry in order to capture that okay, the this practice progressing like this, even better if you can automate the analysis but that's something that we would have to build out personally for them. But there's there's some pretty big opportunities in mind that we really want to go after. Oil and gas is another one. Where they have these huge crude oil tanks they're trying to hold for me the example of a competitor and what they're currently doing right now. So we were speaking with Chevron A while ago, we weren't able to pursue the contract but for a lot of critical infrastructure inspections, whether it's crude oil tanks or bridges, if it's if it's verticalized infrastructure, or if it's infrastructure that you can't just, if you've got a corrosion repair specialist, you can't just drop the GPS coordinate and ask them to go and find this. You have to build the creek create these things. In 3d and they use photogrammetry to do it. Now they're doing some sleight of hand because it probably took them like a day, 12 hours at least to generate the scan. And then they shift over to the images when they zoom in. But that's how they get the labels for this. They're not pulling the images directly off of the the 3d see using like the drone images, they got a good stand in for this. Like there's some cases where that will work just fine. But if you could just upload the entire 3d asset and ask it to show you where all the corrosion is at or show you you know, get an understanding of what the battle damage assessment is from the drone strike or whatever it is. That's the future that we see where you can reduce a lot of the manual aspect of this.
So we're like right there with it. We actually were talking about Francesco. We've got some meetings that are with bhp. We did some market analysis on this and did some outreach, and they love it.

S Speaker 220:32Have you followed what skydio has done? I haven't bothered in a while but I mean two years ago That's what I remember. Is that you want it to do. Yeah, well, I don't know where they are.

S Speaker 120:48They're doing they're doing pretty well. And I would say that they the reconstructions are they're pretty high quality but they require a lot of time. And that's one of the biggest things and then the the advanced scene understanding on top of that is something that they still don't have and I don't think they'll ever have. Okay, yeah.
They're doing they're doing pretty well. And I would say that they the reconstructions are they're pretty high quality but they require a lot of time.

S Speaker 221:06And they were still doing I think a lot of it was photogrammetry back then. Yeah. Yes. And but it's a smart team at this camp.
And they were still doing I think a lot of it was photogrammetry back then. Yeah. Yes. And but it's a smart team at this camp.

And they were still doing I think a lot of it was photogrammetry back then. Yeah. Yes. And but it's a smart team at this camp.
S Speaker 121:20And we we spoke with skydio and naps are actually about we thought like for sure someone's just gonna come in and just squash us and go do this implement it. And both cases people people had to explain to people what NERC was what got some splatting was and then they REMAX are specifically apparently their chief product officer has been going around and showing people on his phone what nerves are and like wants to get people into it, but they're dealing with the weight of having their entire tech stack based on the paradigm was the last one years and there are four things that need to be done in this space like none of it the adapters to get this to go into unity to Unreal all that stuff needs to get built out and still not there yet. So there's still a lot of work to be done in this in this is very much deep tech but it will get there. Okay,
And we we spoke with skydio and naps are actually about we thought like for sure someone's just gonna come in and just squash us and go do this implement it.

And we we spoke with skydio and naps are actually about we thought like for sure someone's just gonna come in and just squash us and go do this implement it.

S Speaker 222:10but I agree. So when did you start the company?
S Speaker 122:14So we started last year and we've been kind of stewing on it for a while but so we last year is when we started really take off we got like a small STTR with the Air Force. And then we went to pitch competition last year. We went full time over the summer and then we were we was graduating with his master's in computer science from Stanford. And we're working on this as we were taking classes. I've since taken my LOA and we are like going full time as of now to really like pursue this in totality. So that last year and really been out to just ensuring that we couldn't see the opportunity here that we consulted the government and etc. And I think we've proven those points out.

S Speaker 222:58Okay, that's good. Yeah. And then you started building and chemo so so you raise precede. I do have
Okay, that's good. Yeah. And then you started building and chemo so so you raise precede. I do have
Okay, that's good. Yeah. And then you started building and chemo so so you raise precede. I do have
Okay, that's good. Yeah. And then you started building and chemo so so you raise precede. I do have
23:08stuff in four minutes. Yeah, just sort of why no worries at all.
stuff in four minutes. Yeah, just sort of why no worries at all.

stuff in four minutes. Yeah, just sort of why no worries at all.
S Speaker 123:15600 620,000 Okay, yeah. And we closed that in January, and then we've gotten smaller objects. A $50,000. Well, we raised 500,000 He got $1,000 Check. Shortly after that. $7,000 check from Francesco and a new we are we're talking with a few and this is not like artificial demand by any means. We there's we've gotten some interest in Seaside and we're talking with Pierre VC and a16z speed run right now. It would be pretty cool that called them tomorrow. But right now, I'd say like, the biggest thing for us is like we're looking for a fee for our seed round. And we haven't exactly gotten the terms of it knocked down but it probably goes somewhere in the $3 million range. We're looking at 2 million but I think that we probably have to go up a little bit. And once we have got a lead, we're pretty confident that we'd be able to fill up around both with pro rata and that also with new investors and there's a few that we would be looking at. Okay. And

24:21so say you're raising a $3 million seed and Okay, so So let me do this. If you can send me the deck some of the links that you will have

S Speaker 124:49Yeah, this is where we are today. So do
S Speaker 224:54you have some revenues coming in already? Yes.
S Speaker 124:59So we have the we haven't completed the pilot yet. But we do have the Dallas Fort Worth pilot. We have the $75,000 efforts. STTR and we're going to be going after more of those we were selected for Director phase two SBIR as well.

S Speaker 125:19And we're hoping to do a few more of these smaller pilots before moving into a category to self serve model where people can sign up and actually you can get a subscription or get a license here by the end of the year. And that's definitely the biggest focus is like shipping and selling is our two main pillars right now that we just need to do to get this word used to be say

S Speaker 225:42So currently, like two pilots, right. Okay. And and then, I guess what are you targeting from NP melakukan standpoint by the end of this year?

S Speaker 125:57Yeah, by the end of this year, we would like to build out one more full stack engineer so get up to six, but also we would like to have at least five so not pilots, but I would say like initial customers, somewhere between the 20 to $30,000 range. And then we would like to get one more contract with the government when we think we can do that. Whether it's a we might have to go with a face on again. So there's only $5,000 contract potentially $150,000 contract, but we want to get $1.25 million based r&d funding in order to actually go apply this to the sub branch of the military. Okay.
