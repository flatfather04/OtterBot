S Speaker 20:30Hi, my name is Anton, and I'm the co founder of videogen. Videogen makes it easy for anyone to create professional videos in seconds. Today we are at over 2.1 million ARR growing over 31% month over month. One year ago, my co founder and I took $30,000 of our savings while interning at AWS and Palantir, and we put it all into launching videogen bootstrapping to profitability out of our senior year of college. Video is quickly becoming the most dominant form of communication with businesses today, spending over $40 billion every single year on professional video production, from marketing videos to training videos to internal communications, we're building the AI video platform that will fully automate video creation for hundreds of millions of businesses worldwide. We're video Gen Thank you.

S Speaker 42:52Hi, my name is Philip, and I'm the CEO of parley. Parley automates flat fee legal work using llms, starting with Visa applications for immigration lawyers. Currently, immigration lawyers are extremely inefficient and spend 20 plus hours putting together a single visa application. We automate this with AI. Since we launched last month, we have eight law firms as customers who are alive on our platform, and have created 50 applications worth 25k in revenue. We expect to make 500k this year from just these customers. There are three and a half million work visas and green cards serviced in the US every year, and we will charge $2,000 per application, which makes immigration law alone a $7 billion market opportunity. Our team has built AI products as PMS and software engineers at companies like LinkedIn and yc, startups like gov dash importer, we've known each other for years as friends and roommates. Thank you.

S Speaker 54:18Hi, I'm Omar and I'm the CEO of ficra. Ficra is the source of truth for every product, screen and user flow, giving companies real time visibility into what their users actually see in their live product. Every founder and pm has lived through the nightmare scenario of testing their signup flow after months of product changes, only to see that AB tests have silently wrecked the user experience. We fixed that my co founder, Mo and I are each three time founders with successful exits. Mo sold sales to the match group after scaling it to 10 million in ARR, we've worked at Apple and Facebook, and both have degrees from Stanford and Carnegie Mellon. Within just two weeks of launching ficra, we closed the 60k annual deal with a uniform previously, their product managers struggled with visibility, wasting hours on complex audits. Now, FIS AI lets them instantly see and search through every user flow for each release for the 200,000 other companies whose product teams are also stuck doing manual, error Pro, error prone tasks, there's a $12 billion market opportunity. We're Fidra. Thank you.

S Speaker 65:39Hi everyone. My name is Isaac, and I'm the co founder of retrofix retrofits, is software that automatically files applications for building incentives. There are $100 billion worth of incentives each year, and our AI software makes the process of applying for them take just a few minutes rather than several days. We launched five weeks ago, and have 120k in ARR. I am a former HVAC technician, and did my undergrad at MIT in material science. Post undergrad, I moved to private equity, where I worked on decarbonization and electrification financing. Daniel, my co founder, did his undergrad at MIT in computer science and machine learning, before dropping out to become a founding engineer at another startup, the 10 most populous cities in the US submit 18 million rebates every year. On average, we make $1,000 per rebate file. This makes this an $18 billion market opportunity. After incentives, we plan on automatically filing all kinds of permits and compliance paperwork previously done by hand. Thank you. Applause.

S Speaker 99:16Hi, I'm Wilson. Parity is the world's first AI sre. It autonomously triages root causes and fixes issues in cloud infrastructure as the first line of defense for on call engineers. AI software engineers like Devin will change the way we write code, but every line of code written also needs infra to support it. AI, SREs are one of the biggest under the radar opportunities today, and we are the team that's building them. We launched last month, and parity is already running inside the cloud infrastructure for six paying customers. We met working together as software engineers at Crusoe. Jeffrey studied CS at CMU Coleman studied CS at Stanford, and I studied CS at MIT. As engineers, we hated being on call and waking up at 4am we're excited to solve that once and for all with parity. Thank you. Priyesh,

S Speaker 1111:35Hello. I'm Sean and I'm the CEO of vendra. Vendra is an AI copilot for hardware teams working with vendors, suppliers and manufacturers. I was a hardware engineer before YC, building things like augmented reality headsets at Microsoft and Apple and autonomous drones like this one at skydio. And I saw that while software teams have really good tools to manage the development process, hardware teams don't have any such tools, because so much of the work they do is with external vendors and suppliers, and no one can really get these external teams to adopt modern solutions. This has been a problem for decades, but we realized we can actually solve this with AI. Vendor simply connects to a hardware team's existing workflows, whether it's via emails or apps like WeChat and WhatsApp, tracks all these communications and automates vendor and project management while building a central knowledge base for all external facing work. We launched this just five weeks ago, and we've already gone from zero to $50,000 ARR across customers and robotics and deep tech in the US alone, this

Finding new cures requires knowing what and where the abnormal molecules are in a diseased tissue, but current tools see less than 1% of those molecules. So cures go undiscovered. We are able to see everything. Scientists simply ship a biological specimen to bio Cartesian and we charge $4,000 per specimen to create a digital molecular map if we capture just 1% of all tumor specimens. That's a $20 billion opportunity. My co founder, Jess, and I did our PhDs together at the University of Pennsylvania in this field. In fact, Jess dropped out of the top MD PhD program in the country to be full time on this I was top in my class in a bioscience commercialization degree at Cambridge. We're bio Cartesian. Thank you.

S Speaker 1719:12Hi, I'm Kelly. We're building craft, an AI motion graphics co pilot. Think playground, but for movement, while there's been a ton of hype surrounding soar, like video generation, we're focused on where the majority of enterprise value lies, vector graphics. I'm at Anirudh, studying computer science at MIT, where we ran the largest undergraduate hackathon in the United States. I worked on infrastructure at discord and was recognized by the White House for design. And aniward has worked on high performance training systems at both Jane Street and vibrance. In just one week, we've already locked down $15,000 in contracted revenue and hit number three on part time in total, we're tapping a $72 billion market opportunity, and we're excited to make motion graphics accessible.

S Speaker 2123:55Hey, everyone. My name is Daniel, and I'm the CEO of apton. Apton is an AIS message that automates Sales and Marketing for consumer service. Businesses, for example, companies like career karma, use aptitude, qualify leads, schedule meetings and automate personalized follow ups. 24/7 since the start and clip batch, we've grown five times fit, 9.4k in MRR. This is a $6 billion market opportunity within the mid market enterprise space alone, previously, our customers were relying on humans to manually respond and follow those leads, but now adapted, they're able to automate personalized conversations at scale that actually convert leads at a higher rate. My co founder and I met freshman year at Berkeley, where I was studying data science and he was studying CS after graduating, we worked in product engineering roles at Tesla in AWS. We're starting with SMS, but we ultimately want to build a multi channel agent that can text, call and email in the exact same way a human can. We are apt. Thank you. You

S Speaker 2427:36Hi. I'm Andrea co founder and CEO of Elaine. We automate family estate planning and settlements on one unified platform, saving users 400 hours per death and facilitating $3 trillion of annual wealth transfers as the AI executor. Elaine was born from a personal experience after my mom passed away, having to settle her estate manually while working caused me to burn out and resign. A common issue costing businesses $100 billion each year, which is why, since launching distribution through businesses six weeks ago, we've signed a $20,000 contract and four design partnerships, including Zendesk, worth $600,000 on conversion, and that does not include another 200,000 in pipeline. Our team is former truebill and Blackstone. I've deployed billions in capital, and my co founder scaled true bill to 200 million. Arr, in the future, we want Elaine to be the digital quarterback for wealth transfers, which, let me remind you, is $3 trillion annually, and we'll take a 3% exec executor cut of it all. We are Elaine. Thank you. Applause.

Spacium is building a network of in space for drilling stations that extend spacecraft lifetimes and unlock new mission profiles in space, fuel is the bottleneck. Once a spacecraft runs out of fuel, its mission ends and it becomes space debris. Our stations bring fuel from Earth, store it in space and make it available to other spacecraft. The fuel is transferred using a proprietary robotic arm that can also make simple repairs. Now, spacecraft can run longer missions, carry larger payloads and go further. Since joining YC, three months ago, we have closed 86 million in binding commercial contracts for retailing. Our first mission is locked in and launches next year. I'm an aerospace engineer. My co founder, Reza is a mechanical engineer. Together, we have designed and built rocket engines, recovery systems and manage payload integrations. We are going to Mars. We are going into deep space. We will get there using fuel from spasm. Thank you. Applause.

The fuel is transferred using a proprietary robotic arm that can also make simple repairs. Now, spacecraft can run longer missions, carry larger payloads and go further. Since joining YC, three months ago, we have closed 86 million in binding commercial contracts for retailing. Our first mission is locked in and launches next year. I'm an aerospace engineer. My co founder, Reza is a mechanical engineer. Together, we have designed and built rocket engines, recovery systems and manage payload integrations. We are going to Mars. We are going into deep space. We will get there using fuel from spasm. Thank you. Applause.

S Speaker 1135:06Hi everyone. I'm Peter, CEO of superunit. Superunit is building an AI powered ERP for companies manufacturing or selling physical goods. This segment represents 1/3 of the $60 billion ERP market, managing physical products creates significant challenges because important financial data is scattered across countless PDFs, spreadsheets and emails with no straightforward way to connect with them without large teams of people. Super unit's first module is an AI accounting and supply chain management software. Since our launch eight weeks ago, we have signed six customers with 8.3k and booked MRR and a pilot with a $200 million apparel company. I experienced this problem firsthand after founding my first company, a golf equipment company that I ran for five years and grew to mid seven figures in annual revenue. My co founder, Zach, was a senior software engineer at stripe, where he built complex payments infrastructure and holds a patent for his work in that field. I have my MBA from Stanford, and Zach has his bachelor's and master's degrees in computer science from Stanford. We are super unit. Thank you. I

S Speaker 3342:12Hello, everyone. I'm guru, co founder and CEO of digital carbon. Digital carbon transforms images or videos into immersive 3d words. We are right now really focused on the real estate market. According to a recent survey, 79% of the home buyers prefer and 90% of the listings don't offer them. The main reason is there's a ton of friction doing these 3d tours, like you have to buy expensive equipment, you have to call in an external photographer, and you have to spend hours doing this photo shoot at Digital carbon. We massively reduce this friction. All you have to do is take two to three minute video or send us some photos, and we can create a smooth, immersive 120 FTS video game like tools of any space we launched two weeks back. We already have 2000 sign ups, and we are working with one of the largest real estate, SaaS providers in the country for potential 2 million ACV. We actually map the entire YC office.
