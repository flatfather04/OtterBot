Mark, very surprisingly, been quite active, actually, in terms of all the deal flows that the companies were looking at, I've been seen you guys have been busy, yeah, yeah. Like, Qualcomm, like, as a corporate is trying to diversify quite a lot in terms of its product offering. So venture team, I would say, acts like a pathfinder for the for the entire corporate to sort of select the areas they should be strategically going towards,

I always loved it, because we got the students to do like diligence on live deals we were working on, but I'm curious whether you ever crossed past the gym.

S Speaker 23:48So Mark, I would say my career progression has been broadly split into two sides, where I've worked as an operator at very early stage startups, but I've also worked as an investor for the last three years. So maybe if I take a reverse chronological pattern to sort of explaining things. I'm currently an investor at Qualcomm ventures. I take a look at Frontier AI, which means all the infrastructure application level companies in AI, but at the same time also something around computer vision, sometimes around industrial technologies, sometimes around physical AI and robotics and the tech stack that can go behind it. So quite opportunistic in that sense. Prior to that, I've also spent time at Menlo Ventures for a six month internship, which was a role between their venture studio and venture investing hub. And I've also worked at Morpheus ventures, which is an LA based fund. Spent time there during for I did my MBA from UCLA, and during this entire period of time, worked with about five different funds as an internship and in part time role. So that's how I got into venture. But taking a step back, I started my career as an engineer back in India. Did my undergrad in Biological Engineering. And during my entire undergrad, I would say, I've worked with a lot of early stage startups, did about 10 plus internships very different kind of companies, from Ed Tech to social media to FinTech, and learned a great deal of entrepreneurship through that. Right after I graduated from IIT Madras, I joined a clean tech firm in their business development team around series A and saw them grow to when unicorn was promoted quite a couple of times during the at the fund took on portfolio PNL management responsibilities. Corporate Development also started a new a couple of new business models for the company, and was responsible for roughly about 17 million era that I drove through, deals that I did so great experience, but I believe I really enjoyed my undergrad time of working with a lot of different startups at the same time, and that's why I wanted to pivot into venture so then moved to UCLA and did the entire venture path I mentioned before. That's awesome.

S Speaker 36:00Jim and I, credit, we started all of our career. Actually, all of us, to some extent, started our careers in corporate venture. Jim started GE venture 17 years ago. I was in corporate venture working for an integrated oil and gas business. And so we have an immense amount of respect for what it takes to work in corporate BC and the relationship building process. And so I love that. I think there's like an element of grittiness that all of us have and respect working with corporate customers and engaging. So definitely affiliation there. I mean, if you spent time at Menlo and qualicom, widen out like you guys are at a pretty interesting inflection point in this whole, like intersection of physical and AI, you got a great platform. So why thinking about a move now?

S Speaker 38:10you a bit of background context on the firm and the role, just to kind of level set around expectations and whether it's fit. So just close our third fund, $400 million vehicle plus sidecar that I'm managing doing kind of BI system roll ups, which I'm spending a lot of my time and attention on these days, kind of like thrive and bunch of other funds buying legacy businesses. The team is lean. Our Website makes it look like we're rather large, but practically it's myself, Jim and Mike Rosengarten. So Jim's Managing Partner, he was with formation eight, and co star with Alex Mike came over from Open Gov, just sold Qualcomm or sorry, sorry, just sold to Cox automotive and and then we have no junior staff, so we're lean partially on purpose ventures, bit of a unique game, but we're hiring for two maybe three roles, because we've got three funds under 20 portfolio companies. I think the pros and cons of being lean is that we don't have infrastructure. Shame on us, but we don't have our department. We've got a good back office team. We have invested there. But the rule itself, you know, I would say, like, 50% of the role is going to be like outbound and just, you know, bringing in qualified leads and working with Jim and Mike myself on opportunities, 50% is like other. And I put an asterisk by other because, like being moving from corporate to decide, the biggest thing I've had to learn is that, like, you know, we have customers too. Our customers are our LPS in each one of the sectors that we play in, we've got not strategics, but like quasi strategic. So in agriculture, I've got to be natural capital Tia. I've got Farm Credit Canada. We do a lot of work and engagement with our LPs, QIA Qatar Investment Authority, state of New Mexico, state pension fund. There's a lot of work that we do to service our limited partners. And on any given day this individual we end up hiring is going to be doing a bit of everything. And so part of that is like, Okay, this isn't going to be 100% deal oriented, which you need to be comfortable with. You know, the previous associate we had actually just went over to Ms and ad did corporate insurance. You know, she sat on like, six of Jim's boards, because he's got 19 of them between this information eight. And so just wanna make sure, generally, you're like, being radically transparent around the role that like, because we're not a pyramid, and have an associate principal partner, like you're gonna be doing everything, and you need to be generally comfortable that. And then the second piece, which is far more important to me, is like, being in a very unstructured environment, I still see us as like a seed stage startup, and the fact that like, I'm starting to get like monday.com and we've been through three CRMs, but just like infrastructure built so we can actually manage like we're a professional fund. But how do you react to both of those things, like, one, the scope being very fluid, and two, the role being very unstructured, and unstructured being like Jim travels 250, days a year. We have an office in San Francisco. The back office team is there? How do you How well do you thrive in that? Because in corporate like, I missed the fact that I had a legal department, and you have all these subject matter experts that like, I miss every day, and most of the time I'm doing everything. So it's a long about way, but it's very important to me to kind of understand how you react to that and figuring out whether there's a
you a bit of background context on the firm and the role, just to kind of level set around expectations and whether it's fit.

Awesome. Any questions for me,
S Speaker 219:41just just one quick question mark, or probably two. I am currently a senior associate at Qualcomm ventures, and I am due to be promoted to a principal level in December. Now, as I know, these tags don't mean much in terms of work responsibilities, but I know the role that you had floated was for an associate, so wanted to understand, just from that perspective, if things would change.
just just one quick question mark, or probably two. I am currently a senior associate at Qualcomm ventures, and I am due to be promoted to a principal level in December.

S Speaker 320:10I'm less concerned around titling, quite honestly, like because we don't have a hierarchy. Everyone's kind of a partner or investor. I'm not concerned about it. I think it's like, we obviously have bans on compensation, which are a little bit more like hard coded. But, you know, I would say, like, clearly the way that we're trying to build these roles, like some firms have a very much like private equity models, like, come in for three years, go back to business school. We obviously want to build somebody that can stay here for the long term. And so like coming in as a senior associate for a year, I think what has to be true we've gotten in the past. Like, yeah, get to a deal end to end, one or two opportunities within fun. Luckily, you're joining at the first start of fund three. We raise another fund in three years. Like, the idea is to have somebody join us as a associate, Senior Associate, now become a principal in fund three, and then get promoted to a partner in fund four. So like we, I'm sure between Jim and myself and you, we can map some process out that way to give you comfort. I'm less concerned about the title,

S Speaker 221:17sounds good. Sounds good. Mark, that works well for me. And one, one question as well, I know I went to the website, I looked at the smaller sub sectors that you particularly enjoy investing in. Smart enterprise amongst those sub sectors is something that I feel I can add a lot of deal flow and value to immediately. Clean Tech as a as a sub sector is also something that I'm very familiar at. I've created a thesis at Qualcomm, which did not fly because we don't have a lot of appetite to invest in that sector internally, but I've spent time there. I've spent three years at a clean tech company. So I understand that space and Life Sciences is something that I can quickly sort of get myself at speed, because I've had a biotechnology engineering undergrad, but I haven't sort of looked at that space a lot. So I just want to understand, do you have any specific allocation mandates across these sub sectors?

S Speaker 322:13No healthcare. I would quarantine because we have two full time healthcare partners. One's a venture builder, one's a medical doctor and so, like, that's an area that, from a subject matter perspective, we're not looking for somebody to supplement. Like, they kind of have that covered RNA, drug discovery, medical devices, biosciences, that's kind of like covered. And we've got our proprietary relationships with George Church at Harvard that we do everything out of his lab, like colossal Biosciences related, and so the smart enterprise side, I'd say we're building our bench strength there with Mike. Mike just joined us with fund three. It's not an area that we've had expertise in, because all of us are very vertical specific, but like clay is a good example, in particular, harmonic Amazon, course, key. So it's an area we're looking to add to. And like, if that's an area of interest, you know, Jim is hiring a senior associate, associate, Mike Rosengarten is hiring an associate. I might actually like right route. You to Mike first, because if that's an area you want to spend more time investing in the way that we kind of look at the firm is like, you know, Jim and I take everything outside of smart enterprise. We're not doing, like infrastructure, networking stuff. It's not what we'll do, yeah, but, but Mike's first deals are, like marketing automation software, stuff that we would have never done in fun too, because none of us have done anything in that area, or we have the right to win. So, yeah, that's of interest. I think that next step would be to connect you with Mike.

S Speaker 223:49That's his background. More, yeah, I think Mark, that would be wonderful. I think I've spent a lot of time there. I've created thesis. I've also created a strong deal flow and venture partnerships there. So could definitely start adding value from day zero in that in smart enterprise sector.

S Speaker 324:10Good. Well, if there are any other questions, what I'll do is, I'll kind of just summarize some of the notes, send it to Mike. We're trying to move relatively quickly to get this role built before the AGM in November. My goal is to have somebody in by like the second or third week of September. So by the end of this week early next I'll probably probably reach back out with some next steps.
