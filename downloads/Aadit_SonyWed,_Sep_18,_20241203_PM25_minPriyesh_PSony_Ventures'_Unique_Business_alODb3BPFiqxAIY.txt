S Speaker 23:50like, personally for you, how interesting it is for you to be sort of focusing on one specific industry, or couple of industries, for that matter. And do you do you look at yourself as sort of gaining deepening down in this word vertical? Do you want to be bread first down the line? How are you thinking about it?

4:11Yeah, great questions. So couple things, right?
S Speaker 25:31yeah, that, yeah. That's very valuable. And I think personally, for that, from that question, for me, is very important right now, because I am at that juncture where I'm I can deep. I can go deeper into a lot of other segments, and I do need to figure out a niche for myself, which is all both exciting enough, but also has a lot of opportunities down the line for me to really create a career. And I guess just a segue, I can give you my introduction, what my background is, how call conventions, operates as a fund. I am originally from India. Others. I did my undergrad in engineering from IIT Madras, and I worked in a clean tech firm for about three and a half years before making a pivot to Anderson and moving to the US. During my time at undergrad, I was very involved in entrepreneurship. I worked with a lot of startups, mostly early stage across all industries, FinTech, Ed Tech, social media, but mostly consumer, I'd say. And then in cleantech, I worked with this company, joined them in around series A in business development, then grew on, took responsibilities around corporate development, saw the company sort of reach a unicorn status. It's still private right now, but that was a great experience. Wanted to still be in early stage, and I realized venture would be a place where I can work with a lot of startups and not really put myself down in one particular idea. And wanted to make that pivot. So at Anderson, sort of tried doing that, worked with a lot of funds throughout my two years, kept interning at fund after fund. Worked with about five funds, including Morpheus, which you may know from LA ecosystem, and then Menlo Ventures in the Bay Area. And finally, right now, working at working with Qualcomm, which is for about eight months as a senior associate here the fund here we invest in deep tech and industries around there would be AI, the entire infrastructure and application stack we've had good investments in, I think the team is more looking at applications right now, and that's where I am focused at and then we do investments in, I'd say, XR, quite a lot. The Qualcomm has been a very strong, I would say, a leader in providing compute for XR devices. So that's a big focus. IoT, anything around industrial automation, automobile tech stack, or, broadly speaking, things that have any angle of compute or connectivity in them, that would be an interest area. So in that sense, the investment focus is broad. I'd say we are, again, a corporate venture fund. So we invest out of the balance sheet. Are for we deploy about 150 $280 million a year in us, and then it's a global fund. So we have offices in India, China, Israel, Latin America, UK, and then, yeah, I was saying the focus areas are broad. So I'm sort of at the juncture where I'm figuring out which areas should I be doubling down. I am breadth first for now. I'm doing a lot of sourcing, meeting a lot of ventures, and that way being sort of stretched across different industries. So trying to figure that out for myself, I guess probably the more I look at different ventures, the more I'll get an idea on what's exciting to me and where I should be doubling down. But yeah, that's that's where the fund is right now,
yeah, that, yeah. That's very valuable. And I think personally, for that, from that question, for me, is very important right now, because I am at that juncture where I'm I can deep.

S Speaker 18:53makes sense. So I guess couple questions for me, like my colleague of mine, this guy studio with the Paul Cohen CEO Summit. I think you guys have that, yeah, in October, yeah. You know what are like the broader venture initiatives that you guys look at? What are the check sizes that you do and what's kind of the thesis behind the venture arm? You know, some teams have it as a way to generate return. Some have it as a focus to just explore new opportunities. Others have it to double down on specific core competencies. What's the goal here? Like, are you guys competing with like, what Nvidia ventures in that group is doing? Or is it very different?

S Speaker 212:17for sure. It's a company called sift tree, s, I, F, T, R, E, E, and I can send you a deck right after my call, so you can take a look. Sift tree. I think it's raising right now, possibly a 2 million round seed check. They have about 500k in ARR booked with a entertainment Management Agency which manages a lot of gaming influences, and they have currently an analytics API for discord, wherein you can plug in that API with discord, get all of your conversation data in, and it will churn out a lot of cohort based analytics. And this, as per my conversations with the team, they are way beyond what traditional analytics tools like Sprout Social or Brandwatch would give you. In fact, some of these companies, which are more established, can use them as a technology provider right now, for us others, they are a little bit early, because we are preferably a Series A and we want to see some traction before we take a bet. But the team's pretty interesting. We got it from one founder we had invested in in the past. So it's a it's through a referral that we value quite a lot, and could be an exciting one to for you to look at. I'll send you to this. Yeah,

S Speaker 113:43is nothing to, you know, frown upon, I guess, what kind of traction do you guys look for in terms of, you know, product market fit, because Series A, for AI companies could be, you know, still product development in terms of getting customers and stuff, or, you know, proving out where they are in terms of AR or financial metrics. So I'm curious, like, is there, is it user engagement metrics base what exactly really gets you guys excited? So

S Speaker 115:05think, for us. You know, one company that comes to mind that might be interesting for you is a company called reecher.

15:13They're doing like, kind of voice cloning and voice
They're doing like, kind of voice cloning and voice
They're doing like, kind of voice cloning and voice
They're doing like, kind of voice cloning and voice
S Speaker 215:37for sure? Other Yeah, I have, I have personally taken a look at some of these companies in the in a similar space, and I guess my follow up question would be, do you do they have any specific angle? I would say, we have an investment in well said Labs, which does voice cloning and voice generation, and that that company kind of fell a little bit bad behind interaction when compared to 11 labs. So if it's slightly, if they have a special, different angle, a different ICP, a different market they are targeting, would certainly be very exciting for us. Yeah,
for sure? Other Yeah, I have, I have personally taken a look at some of these companies in the in a similar space, and I guess my follow up question would be, do you do they have any specific angle?

S Speaker 116:15I think the big thing that really separates them is just the quality of the voice coding that they've done. Yeah, they're working with Emmy award winning. You know, fake studios are working with them. 11 labs, I feel like has done a great job of becoming this, like go to solution for a lot of smaller, venture backed companies that just have something that's cost effective. I would say this is more the higher quality end in terms of what they're bringing to the table. Maybe it's not as comprehensive, but what they do is what they do pretty strong.

S Speaker 216:49Oh, very exciting, for sure. And you feel that the market for specific high quality voice cloning is big enough.
Oh, very exciting, for sure. And you feel that the market for specific high quality voice cloning is big enough.

S Speaker 218:44Absolutely. Aditya, I'd certainly appreciate that. Thanks a lot.
Absolutely. Aditya, I'd certainly appreciate that. Thanks a lot.
Absolutely. Aditya, I'd certainly appreciate that. Thanks a lot.
Absolutely. Aditya, I'd certainly appreciate that. Thanks a lot.
19:49We're kind of going through that process right now.
We're kind of going through that process right now.
We're kind of going through that process right now.
We're kind of going through that process right now.
S Speaker 119:52One company is called JUMP CUT media. It's founded by awarded professor, pretty interesting in terms of how they're building their solution, and then they just haven't had the traction that you would assume the raise that they've had so far. So that's where we get a little worried. But you know, again, it's an area that might not be interesting for investment, but it could be interesting for a business, so it warrants at least

S Speaker 120:38Yeah, like, it would be great to have something more consistent. So if we want to put something every month or every couple months,
Yeah, like, it would be great to have something more consistent. So if we want to put something every month or every couple months,
Yeah, like, it would be great to have something more consistent. So if we want to put something every month or every couple months,
Yeah, like, it would be great to have something more consistent. So if we want to put something every month or every couple months,
S Speaker 220:46it might be worth it, for sure. Yeah, I'll do that absolutely. And a couple of questions I had Adit, particularly on sort of creating a career in CVC. I do not come from traditionally, a finance background. I have been more, let's say, operator first, and I've had roles across product, fundraising, growth, branding, business development, things like that, and then, and I have used that to sort of leverage it a position into venture. Now, the more I think about it, do you think, let's say I personally want to spend the next few years trying to prove myself as a great investor and then sort of trying to make a big move in my career?
