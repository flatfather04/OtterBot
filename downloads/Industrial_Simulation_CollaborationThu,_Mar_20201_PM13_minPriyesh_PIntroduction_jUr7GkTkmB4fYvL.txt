S Speaker 10:12Hi, you have a few minutes. Hi, I'm Priyesh. I'm with Qualcomm ventures. So very nice to meet you physically is a very big focus area for us. We are talking to a lot of foundation model players and also digital twins. So we'd love to see where beyond math lies, how what's your tech platform architecture behind it, and how do you differentiate with against other players in the market? So I

S Speaker 24:01We're still, we're like a seed safe startup. We raised our seed last year. Our partners early stage. We led the rounds, inside partners. Here we have a CBC or JLR. We can say publicly, a lot of people are very private. And we have, we're starting to branch out into like aerospace. So we have a big, multi year project in there. And to give you an example, what we're trying to do is take that project. We're working on manufacturing, technical manufacturing, tapping pressure, and there's very, very small components this big, running around simulations that take two weeks to run, which means they don't really get a chance to optimize. So we're looking at running that in about a minute. That's marketing of 1% improvement in COVID this big, which translates to about $2 billion of fuel for each 50

S Speaker 16:03that's that's very interesting. Thanks a lot for the overview. I totally get. We've been talking to a lot of World Foundation model companies, and we understand they won't be able to get to that level of granularity, which is actually very important for the industrial applications of it. I have personally not come across a company doing simulations for the automobile industry, although internally at Qualcomm, we work with all of the automobile players, and our chips go in all of their ADA systems. So it's a very big strategic focus area for us. I would love to dig a little bit deeper, sort of do my own research and come back for a follow up chat. Would you be open to, oh,
that's that's very interesting. Thanks a lot for the overview. I totally get.

S Speaker 26:39and as well? I mean, just a number of people. So if you think model. So we could do that kind of thing. We have. We haven't seen any demand for weather models out there. And part of the simplification is the earth is simple sphere. So we're focusing on very complex geometries, which is where you need that? Yeah, I'm not sure. Might be the Disney robot. And then the other, the other bit is like, people like Peggy Lee and keep mine and Sora, who are basically learning off video, yeah, really interesting. But again, this, this kind of application. You can't see it, you can't see it, but you can't see here dissipation in video. So we think you have to go the next level. You can't just take YouTube videos. We don't think, yeah, I mean, there's a lot of higher places burning, there's a lot of water flowing, but it's, it's like conservation of mass, not conservation of energy, right? So we've kind of gone down this route. We think it's the right route. And yeah, the next three, six months, we're looking at like a launch. We are our targets been like daily industrial enterprise users, yeah, such a bandwidth constrained company. We're still trying to make green daily with a few sort of sign partners. I agree. Yeah, we scale out. So, but yeah, I mean, we should, we should connect so we're both timers. I've knocked on my business card so I can give you his shots. But then,
and as well? I mean, just a number of people. So if you think model. So we could do that kind of thing. We have. We haven't seen any demand for weather models out there.

8:10yeah, that'd be great.
yeah, that'd be great.
yeah, that'd be great.
yeah, that'd be great.
S Speaker 28:20I guess, in terms of, like, where we are, like funding wise, with raised our seed last year, say, 8 million US in tight, obviously, payment, yeah, we've got a long runway. So I think, you know, we had been pushing back any funding talking. But I think given the speed of things, in the demand. You know, we we may start conversations like later on this year.

S Speaker 18:44For sure, it's always good to sort of have these conversations right now, and when the opportunity comes. Meanwhile, during that process, we can also have some of the business unit engagements and see so they would be the right guys to validate the technology, although I understand them, and

S Speaker 19:02And what kind of data did you use to train your models? Do you have design partners already in place? So

right? And I think, yeah, I'm going to see what's happening.
right? And I think, yeah, I'm going to see what's happening.
S Speaker 29:27I think we kind of have to do that just because of the proprietary nature of all the data. I think if we went down the route of taking customer geometries, we can't train off it, we can't build a platform. We're a consultancy. We want to build a platform. So we've kind of taken that burden of just like we need. Build the data asset ourselves. You need to understand the geometries, understand the kind of flow conditions.

S Speaker 19:55point. So yeah, that also, that pain also sort of builds a good barrier to entry for the player. So it will come in handy down the line. That's great. Thanks a lot for the time, Darren, I appreciate it, and I'll come back with a Yeah, be in touch. Thank you
