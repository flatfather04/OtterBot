S Speaker 121:29So the first four or first five are going to be quick Lightning Rounds. We don't do the decks. It should be super fast. I'll model for the first two, and then we'll go through the first five, and then we're going to do the rest of them one by one by one with the deck. Nice thing is, we got all the other announcements of the way, so it just deals that one plus intros. Okay, so lightning round, one bit sweets. I know somebody who's running a company. David dobrik, is the co founder. We're basically building protein pack snacks that are like sweets from your childhood, but in modern day form. So think like create proteins, but inside of nerves, rope variations, Swedish Fish variations, things like that. I've introduced a few people to them through other channels, but I haven't brought up in this call. They're raising a 315 it's basically a bet on an influencer focused company, kind of like beastables or feastables. I think for Mr. Beast, if you like CPG are curious about this one, that'd be one to go for next one, biological black box. This one is on the complete other end of like deep, deep, deep tech. I got this deal from somebody, and essentially it's two neurosurgeon background folks who are building AI compute infrastructure with live neurons embedded into the infrastructure. So the advantage of that, apparently, I still have to dive into the research, is that they can do model training for about 1/5 the cost, and they've already tested up to GPT two levels. They have Lois from ginkgo Bioworks and for testing it out. And if one of them starts using it, or one of the foundational models starts using it, it could be 100 mill kind of thing in a couple of years. But obviously very binary. They're raising, I believe, 10 on 40, with 7 million brought in, including, I think the head of Google AI, who's an investor. So I'm running SPV for small checks. And unfortunately, small checks means anything under 200k but anything, if you're a quarter million or bigger check and you're interested, feel free to let me know. I know at least one fund on here is already diluted into m&a may or may not. Piggyback off that diligence. Thank you in advance. JJ, and then next up, we'll go with three more Lightning Rounds, and I'm going to shut up because I talked for about 25 minutes straight. Cool. Danny, you're up. Quick note on playback rewards. Yeah, hey everyone, first time

S Speaker 125:34Thank you. No worries. So a turnover is essentially a diamond consumer facing company. What they do is they allow you to make Memorial diamonds from hairs or ashes of loved ones. Thank your pets. Thank your relatives. Thank celebrities that you want to follow. They the biggest things I'd say about them is they're raising, I believe, a 5 million round on a 25 pre and I think they had 14 million revenue last year. So it's a very generous pricing on what they're doing. They have partnerships with, I believe, one of the biggest funeral home providers. Home provider conglomerates in either Japan or Taiwan, and they're expanding out to Asia, where there is an even higher spend on post life services and things of that sort. Think of this expanding over to celebrities. So if you want to get, if you are feeling like getting a diamond made out of the hair of your favorite athlete or celebrity, there may be a way to do things like that, but this is sort of a consumer play with a very reasonable price and something that I think is culturally aligned. So if you're a consumer investor, cultural investor, things like that, they're raising five on a 25 pre that is what I would say in Brian's voice, and I'll leave it at that. Final one for the Lightning Rounds is going to be Jared with upshift.

26:43What do we have here?
What do we have here?
What do we have here?
What do we have here?
26:48Nope, all right, I'm
S Speaker 126:51sorry. Short upshift is a revision to autonomous mobility, where they actually are building cars in a Southwest Airlines model of what autonomous driving looks like. So you have the same car across local fleets, and what they do is they actually have remote drivers, which forgoes a lot of the regulations and compliance issues on self driving vehicles. And they think we're basically remotely driving you places with local No, I believe they're in one or two cities now, 200k Arr, from what they're doing so far. If you look mobility, if you like, really big place. This is an alternate some of the autonomous vehicle challenges that we're seeing out there. That's what I can say about that is the last lightning round one. Trey. Did you have a question about this one or a prior one? Okay, just saw the handout. All right, so sorry. Can you please add the links? And again, I believe we have one person requesting. Thank you so much. Yeah, so that's the lightning round I talk to those ones fast between influencer suites, neurons on computers, gaming rewards, diamonds of loved ones, ashes or hair and semi autonomous vehicles. Now take a breath and go through the more full pitch versions of the 10 companies that I selected that thought would get the most interest from people here. So for these ones, we can structure it a little bit more. I'm going to put it into the group, and that's what the presentation looks like. First up for the longer version ones is going to be Yoni with envy, and this time, we'll have the deck as the parallax in the parallax in the background, and we can dive in.
sorry. Short upshift is a revision to autonomous mobility, where they actually are building cars in a Southwest Airlines model of what autonomous driving looks like. So you have the same car across local fleets, and what they do is they actually have remote drivers, which forgoes a lot of the regulations and compliance issues on self driving vehicles. And they think we're basically remotely driving you places with local No, I believe they're in one or two cities now, 200k Arr, from what they're doing so far. If you look mobility, if you like, really big place. This is an alternate some of the autonomous vehicle challenges that we're seeing out there. That's what I can say about that is the last lightning round one. Trey. Did you have a question about this one or a prior one? Okay, just saw the handout. All right, so sorry. Can you please add the links? And again, I believe we have one person requesting. Thank you so much. Yeah, so that's the lightning round I talk to those ones fast between influencer suites, neurons on computers, gaming rewards, diamonds of loved ones, ashes or hair and semi autonomous vehicles.

S Speaker 628:24Perfect. Thanks, Mike. This is a super interesting one to me. At least came up. I didn't know this was a problem until I came across the founder. And I love those kinds of things. So what MB does is they so the problem, basically, is that there are fertility clinics out there. They're very limited. There's a serious shortage of fertility fertility clinics and and what he figured out, or what this team figured out, is basically how to hand some of that responsibility over to an OB GYN that is perfectly qualified to do the exact same job, and obviously facilitating it all using software, where eventually they plan on getting to in home care. So you don't even have to go to your OBGYN to do certain things. They're doing $100,000 in ARR they've only been live for a few months. They're already in touch with all the major fertility groups throughout the world, basically, but more so in the US founders based in Israel, they're working on a US based entity right now, and they're just growing very, very fast, doing something I haven't seen anybody else do. So that's pretty much the 32nd bit

S Speaker 629:42I haven't seen anybody else doing anything similar. It seems to be an incredibly untapped market. Lots of potential down the line too. So it's not necessary. It's an immediate yes, they're, they're, luckily, this would normally be a con, but they're, they're able to avoid all regulatory issues at the moment, at least when dealing with software only, so they only have to worry about HIPAA compliance, which is relatively easy otherwise. I really haven't seen any cons, but I think someone who might be I'm working together with these guys, so I'm not the industry expert. I'm not if someone else knows more about it, I've done my diligence, but as a male, definitely limited in my knowledge on that. They're doing a 12 and a half cap pre money cap safe right now. And what else, Mike, did I miss? Anything?

32:01all right, like, if you're ready, we'll do truth system.
all right, like, if you're ready, we'll do truth system.
all right, like, if you're ready, we'll do truth system.
all right, like, if you're ready, we'll do truth system.
S Speaker 932:05I'm ready. And sorry, there's actually a typo. It's truth systems, um, so that's the company name, um, truth systems is a hallucination detection tool that enables trust and safety for LMS. They're starting with applying their model to the legal field. I actually met this company when they were an undergrad at UCLA in October of 2023 gave them a small 50k check at that time, it was basically idea on the like a you know idea on a napkin type stage. And since then, they've grown really quickly. They did a great job of putting together a great group of advisors in the legal space. And since then, they've grown to, I think they're at 140k arr. They've also secured four design partners, including unicorn. They I think Bloomberg is also one of their POCs now as well, two of the POCs are expected to convert this month, and the company is just super capital efficient. They only raised the 50k that I gave them, and now are going out to raise a million and a half pre seed round. This is really the first chunk of money that they're getting. We're going to likely participate. I think that the valuation cap. It's undecided right now. They open up the round this week, but somewhere between seven to 9 million is, I think, where they're going to land, depending where retraction is. I think during the fundraise, big thing, I guess, is the team, despite it being really young, they have a ton of experience in the in the AI research space. One of them worked at UCLA, is NLP and Stanford Codex. The other one worked at a FinTech unicorn for some time, but just extensive knowledge in the AI research space. So really impressive team, despite despite their age, the I scored nine. I think reason, same as my pro, they've been able to find a strong ICP for the product. Legal seems to all be very excited about implementing this technology. For a while, we were kind of between legal and med tech, and just because of HIPAA, of course, legal made more sense, and it's been something that they've been able to move really quickly, and it's also been accepted universally. So I think one of their customers is actually in the UK, and then Colin, I guess, would be just their age, and, you know, first experience running a company, but I think that's mitigated by their extensive background in the space.

S Speaker 935:56Yeah, so they detect whether they think it could be hallucination, and then, with the supported text, you're able to, then, you know, determine whether it is or refute it. And I think that's kind of where the line is drawn between detection.

I will get them some legal tech companies. I used to focus exclusively on legal tech so there's definitely a buyer need for something like this. I have a million questions on there and go to market and their customer acquisition of legal tech companies, but that's a train of thought, but Brian, the demand is there for something along these lines.

S Speaker 1437:49Cool. Any other questions? You mentioned that they have some advisors, and I saw some of the names. They are pretty well known in this space, but I'm curious if they have anyone full time, or if they just approach those people like as, yeah,

So they just, you know, we're in, our researchers realize that there's a hallucination problem, which, you know, everyone realizes that there is, and didn't know what to apply it to. And we worked on, you know, what spaces legal tech made the most sense. Then they got these advisors in, and then since the advisors came in, I think within the past four months, they've had four POCs, one converted to 140k contract probably will be 250k next two months. And then they have a bunch of other customers that will hopefully convert as well to be north of 500k Arr,

S Speaker 840:32for chat. Yeah? So really cool company. It's funny enough. I actually didn't love this one initially because I thought the product was a little simple. So what they do is, you know, they work with farms, or basically anyone who steps put on a farm. So these could be distributors, packers, veterinarians, even they take these little QR codes, sometimes they're magnets, sometimes they're stickers, and place them on top of things like farm equipment, trees, basically anything that matters to a farm operator, and the hands the distributor is basically what's going to hop on the farm. Can scan these things and then fill out what they need. So here's the status of the tree, here's the status of the tractor, here's the status of our truck. It basically it powers this data layer for farms that has been missing and, you know, most of the web two era, just given that a lot of the software that sold the farms is bloated, too expensive. They don't want to actually use them. And so my concern for the business is so simple. It's just a QR code and a simple like almost air table, like back end infrastructure to organize all this data. But, you know, as we dug into the business more, I mean, this is, this is a company where, if customer references were probably the strongest I've ever seen. Farmers absolutely love it. They're using it like crazy, both on a, you know, individual user basis, but, you know, spreading out. And it's actually really nice that it's spreading out to, sorry, am I supposed to be going along with the Decker up?

S Speaker 841:59But so it's really low cost, easy to use, you know? And what we're finding is it's bleeding outside of the farm. So food practice, they go onto the farm, they take all the fruit they need, and they say, Hey, what is that little QR code that's really interesting. They want it, and they can deploy it super easily. It's getting moved into bats. It's getting moved into a bunch of different areas. So my concerns with the product being simple, it's actually not a bug, it's a feature, and that's what the farmers want. And you know, of course, they have ideas on how to introduce llms and things, but, you know, funny enough, farmers, soon as you talk to them about AI, there's a lot of cognitive distance there. And you know, it's one of the things we actually really like about this team. So the CEO, he's a technologist, Silicon Valley operator by training, but he grew up on a farm, so he can really speak the language of the customer. And, you know, again, when we do those references, they just say great things about him, and it's like, actually someone who's selling me something that understands my use case and my needs, and they're not just trying to, you know, throw bloated software, done my done my bullet. So major pros that we like, really solid team. They've built businesses before. Really, really good price relative to the traction. They're getting lots of really great usage and Product Market Fit signal. I think the big cons here is, you know, it's, it's ag tech. This is not necessarily an early adopter group. You know, the they kind of have this interesting, like, they're in this go to market death zone in terms of, like, their ACVs. And right now they need to figure out, how do they get the scale? Scale will go to market motion. A lot of it is just founder driven sales right now, and that's clearly not sustainable at the price points. When you talk to the customers, I don't really know that there's much room for increasing ACVs, just given the nature of the farms in their budgets, but yeah, lots of you're seeing people use it all over the place. It seems like a pretty horizontal piece of technology in the context of farmers and people who are working in ag, yeah, I kind of sped through that. Am I missing anything?

S Speaker 844:50asset. Yeah, I haven't looked at that company in particular, but, you know, I think for us, the why now is that, you know, when you talk to all these farmers, you know, a lot of these people, you know, you can sell software to them that you know, biz, op software and data software to them, but it's it's bloated, it doesn't have what they need. It's too expensive, it's hard to use, it's complicated. And I think for the longest time, you know, when you talk to these farmers, we'd ask them, Why? Why? Why are you buying this relative to all this stuff that you've seen before? And they just said, look, we've been running our businesses on spreadsheets, and more often cases, pen and paper. And you know, in the era of seeing their kids go to school on Zoom and seeing like, hey, actually, software can actually be beneficial, but it needs to be the right price, I just think it was the right place in terms of their comfortability with using software. And you know, the business can actually deliver at an attractive price to them, that's my guess, but that's definitely one question where it's like, okay, you know, they have the opportunity to adopt before, but they're not. But I think we got over that concern just how good the reviews are and the references and like, oh my gosh, where's this kind

But it's these older farmers who are like, Okay, I've seen software before. Most of the time somebody comes to pigeon to me, and while Obama hits them because they don't know my, my my circumstance. But, you know, one, I think it's the founder who can actually speak to the customer. And then two, it's, it is that simple. You just scan a QR code. You know, it takes 10 seconds to fill one of these things out for a farmhand. And then they go on their way, and then the owner at the back end can kind of pull up all the data they need. Because the main thing is that they're unlocking all this data that lived on pen and paper just wasn't getting recorded in the first place, and so now they have just much more data surface area to work with. And they're like, Wow, I can actually glean some really interesting stuff from this that it wasn't into before.

S Speaker 847:37Yeah, and I'm certainly not qualified enough to talk to it, but I'll just kind of talk to an example, if you will. So there's one of the references that we did. Was a farmer. They have a truck that is getting kind of old, you know, that they use, it's tree fruit farm. They use this truck to kind of carry a bunch of stuff, mostly the fruit that comes off the trees. And, you know, they have all these, you know, maintenance things that they need to, you know, have their hands check in periodically, and you all the time, it would be some hand misused the truck and didn't want to tell anyone about it. But now that the farm has grip and is mandating every time you get on that truck, truck, take five seconds to fill out what happened. What did you do? They actually have a record of where it went down, who the bad employee was, when it broke down. And what's happening is grip on the back end is saying, Okay, here's a pattern of all the different things you know that, that you know here, here's a pattern of all the different ways that people have logged in and you've done their maintenance record. You can just, you know, they've introduced light AI in the terms of, like, hey, what you know, how did my tractor break down? It will pull up the record. You know, it's more of like, using AI from, like, a user interface navigate all the data piece. But

S Speaker 748:46yeah, I think back to my original question is, like, are they able to show, like, actual cost savings for the farmers? Because over the long haul, like, if they're not, like, it's a great tool. But what's it doing? Hey,

S Speaker 1849:35understanding of it. So when you're looking at analyzing biological samples, the main ways of doing it right now. Better do mass spectrometry, which is effectively trying to scale and weigh specific parts of a molecule, or you're using binding assays, which effectively, if you know what you're looking for, you're able to understand if that molecule or part of the molecule is present there or not.

S Speaker 1850:15They've built the almost science fiction, like ability to understand the vibration of parts of individual molecules and create a digital twin of what that molecule looks like in order to be able to use in anything from modeling or analysis on a computer. So they're effectively transforming biology into a digital twin of that particular molecule. And as I was mentioning earlier, the two ways of doing it right now are either breaking the molecule into individual pieces and using chemical mass spectrometry in order to understand what those species are, or you know exactly what you're looking for using finding the studies in order to understand if that piece is there or not. They're using the molecular operation of the individual pieces of that larger molecule or compound, in order to understand what's inside it without actually destroying the sound, which is, you know, where the magic comes in. So you're looking at the ability to create a digital twin of a biological molecule without destroying the individual molecule.

S Speaker 1851:30And by creating this digital twin, you're now able to use it in anything from running digital experiments so being able to use one molecule without destroying it and running a number of experiments digitally without using any more of the sample size. And the team is all PhDs. It's a Stanford spin out the series A was led by zoig. This is a comfortable note, so we're not talking about a pre seed around here, and they have about 750k left on a convertible note. It's a 26 million post. It's both the hardware and the software that they're building. The hardware is actually the ability to do this quantum sensing. The software is the ability to create a digital twin and then create this spectrum of a molecule that they can be ingested in our software solutions. So think of it as a translation between biology and code. That's probably the simplest way to think about

S Speaker 1152:36just a quick question, how much of the digital twin properties are innately the same as the sample sizes. So in other words, they have the ability to actually act and behave the exact same way as the original core sample. Or is it more the model of what the sample will do digitally

S Speaker 1852:54Yeah, great question. The modeling is not what they're doing, right? So the analysis of that particular sample is not something they're focused on. They're working with other companies to effectively enter translate the biological sample into the digital twin, and that digital twin can be used by other softwares to do analysis. But the benefit of having digital twin is that if there's a new analysis available in the future, you're able to have created that copy that's stored so you actually don't need a second molecule later in the future to be able to analyze it inside. You can look at the same thing multiple times by having created, effectively a copy of it. Does that answer your you know your question?

S Speaker 1259:37all right, am I sharing the storage defender deck. I am all right, so I'm Gary benaroff from new ventures. Storage defender is a deal we did maybe a year ago, and what they do is they have technology to secure storage units and other things, but primarily right now, imagine a self storage unit. And if you go to a big building that has a bunch of self storage units, they sell individually per unit, it's compelling because it's a kind of sleepy market that has really good, sticky, sort of reoccurring revenue to associate with it. And it's a real problem. Two out of 10 of these facilities get broken into. So it's not that hard to sell. And the technology, which is patented, is pretty cool and very simple. Basically, you attach a piece of hardware to your unit, and if somebody comes in, you get a text message. The traction is around 2 million of ARR the teams, I would call them, adults in the room. They've been around the block. They're credible. They've done a nice job. I would say the where am I at? The score? I give them an eight out of 10. When I talk about the cons, I'll tell you why it's not higher, but the Pro is, management's give me a lot of confidence that they're they're onto something here, and they're about to unlock some larger growth. I think a con is that they only grew 33% last year. And there's a lot of reasons for that that I can get into if somebody wants to talk. I think the lingering questions is, you know, can they hit the 3x growth that they're projecting this year? And they're working on a sort of memo to detail how exactly they're going to do that. This is a round that is 16 mil post, of which there's 600k left, and they're willing to sort of take that much more so the round that we did a while ago. So I think it's quite attractive, given the traction. And my involvement is that I'm an investor,

This is a round that is 16 mil post, of which there's 600k left, and they're willing to sort of take that much more so the round that we did a while ago. So I think it's quite attractive, given the traction. And my involvement is that I'm an investor,
all right, am I sharing the storage defender deck. I am all right, so I'm Gary benaroff from new ventures. Storage defender is a deal we did maybe a year ago, and what they do is they have technology to secure storage units and other things, but primarily right now, imagine a self storage unit. And if you go to a big building that has a bunch of self storage units, they sell individually per unit, it's compelling because it's a kind of sleepy market that has really good, sticky, sort of reoccurring revenue to associate with it. And it's a real problem. Two out of 10 of these facilities get broken into. So it's not that hard to sell. And the technology, which is patented, is pretty cool and very simple. Basically, you attach a piece of hardware to your unit, and if somebody comes in, you get a text message. The traction is around 2 million of ARR the teams, I would call them, adults in the room. They've been around the block. They're credible. They've done a nice job. I would say the where am I at? The score? I give them an eight out of 10. When I talk about the cons, I'll tell you why it's not higher, but the Pro is, management's give me a lot of confidence that they're they're onto something here, and they're about to unlock some larger growth.

S Speaker 191:03:47the pros are that's the guy that invented this technology. Is the CTO, and he recently stepped back from the CEO position. They brought on a professional CEO. They took his last company through series D financing. The con is that their revenue has been about flat because they're transitioning from kind of a service model to a platform model. But they're about to sign on a major their first major kind of Enterprise Client, which would dramatically increase their revenues. The rounds are wrapping up. They have about 150k left, 500k raise instead of ten million valuation. Cool.

S Speaker 11:06:28Thank you so much. Now, because we had some fun, and Billy has 15 people that are curious, so I finish on time. I'm going to step in and substitute for the final one. Oh, 17 people now want to know how much spicy um. So the last one I'm going to step in very quickly to do and talk instead of Matt, just because I want to make sure we respect time ethos space in short form, is building essentially ports in space. So think of your average space port. It's a group of access engineers, and they should build space ports on the moon. The big things go about them very strong team. They have an understanding of planetary geology and launch they provide geology, and launch, they put financing partners on board astronomical market sizing. According to them, limited traction, raising $2 million I don't know what the price is, but effectively, if you look at space tech and you're curious about something that's very out there. No pun intended again, space parts on the moon might be the way to go. I know a few funds in here that might go in that might go in that direction, but I would give more time for questions or let somebody else talk, but we are going to end on time. So yeah, Mike, I know much either, but I still hold to it. So you're going to get the links in the follow up email from me. You will be asked to vote by 8am the eastern Pacific, 11am Eastern tomorrow, and please make sure to vote. Oh, look, it's five o'clock and we are done. We did not do the intros. We'll add those. If you want to join the Priyesh chat, you have my number, Gary, please make me the host so that I don't lose the chat. Thank you all for joining. Have a good time at GP if you're there and everybody, have a wonderful evening. Expect a follow up email from me, and if you are slow to vote, that one text message before you get on my bad side. Have a wonderful day everybody. Thank you so much guilt.
