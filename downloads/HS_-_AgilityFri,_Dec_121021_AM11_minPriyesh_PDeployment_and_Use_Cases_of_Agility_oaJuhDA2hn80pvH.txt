S Speaker 10:00Ability means that there's not this fixed relationship between how big the robot is and how big the payloads that it can handle can be. We can actually use our ability to place the stability polygon of the robot to be able to break that relationship where you have a very compact robot that can move relatively large loads in relatively

S Speaker 10:26Now with that, what we've been able to do is take this robot out into the world and deploy it at customers. I'm going to show you some videos of some of our use cases where we've been deployed. Perhaps the most well known is gxo, where we've been deployed for over a year. Now we've delivered 100,000

0:43totes in this AMR
S Speaker 10:45unloading task. And what you can see here is that this task is exactly exemplifying those properties that I was talking about. What makes this interesting and difficult to automate in other ways is that the robot is interacting with an AMR where it needs to reach into the AMR. It needs to be flexible, because the AMR is not necessarily exactly positioned or coming to a fixed location. The totes have not been placed into any fixtures. They're just on a shelf, and it's taking on that uncertainty and connecting two pieces of automation that can then be more structured. The AMR just has to kind of show up in this general area, and the conveyor doesn't need any special fixturing or things like that. We can just connect those two things up. That's what made this such a good use case for us. It's what made gxo interested in deploying this. And this is the type of thing that makes for good use cases, in general, for humanoids that we can go after today, and that's where agility has been focused in finding these types of use cases. We can look at another one here. So this is a manufacturing environment where we've been deployed, and the robot is basically depolytizing Some parts to load into some machinery that does some sort of operation. I'm not sure if this is heat treatment or washing or something like that.

2:00So again, this is
S Speaker 12:01our robot making use of its mobility and its dynamic stability to be able to reach in, pick up these relatively heavy bins of metal parts without necessarily taking a lot of floor space. This is, this is the work cell as you know that, as it was designed before the robot was in, was in places, largely we're just using what's there and moving around it and working with it and these types of applications. And you can see here, this is, you know, we have a lot of hours of video of this now, because the robot is just going at it all day. You just swap out your next pallet of stuff, and the robot is just taking that new palette and moving it through the system. It's really exciting to be able to see our ability to do a task like this really bring value today into something that would be hard to automate using other methods, and achieve a level of reliability where we can do entire pallets worth of work here throughout a full day or a full shift operation. That's what we can achieve today with a humanoid platform. It's really exciting. That's really cool. That wasn't the case you know, years ago. That's what we should all be trying to get to, this level of reliability, this level of usability. Now here's another example from another one of our customers. This is a tote stacking case. So this is basically, there's a bunch of these empty totes that come out, and this customer finds it really inconvenient to try and deploy automation here, because you can see that there's a mobility challenge and a flexibility challenge here. This is a conveyor system that's underneath another conveyor system. There's all these struts and things like that everywhere, and we are able to basically deploy and move around all of that without having to change it, without having to modify the system and do this task where we're putting these stacks together so they can be moved to the next piece of machinery. That's the type of flexibility and use of mobility that really makes a humanoid form factor really valuable, and that's something that we can go after today. It's not it's not an aspirational goal to get to in years and years like these are real customers that are getting value right now, and that's where we can build an ecosystem of useful deployments for this type of technology. So let's switch gears a little bit. That's what makes humanoids valuable today. What makes human rights employable today. What do we need to do to get humanoids into these types of areas and these types of regimes, I would argue it's three kind of big things that we need to bring as a product out to make humans successful. It's configurability, which is a very general way of saying that these robots need to be easier to deploy a little bit earlier. If it's a pain to deploy the robot, then the cost of deployment is really high, and nobody wants to go reliability. If you can't work a full shift, if you can't run for a long period of time without someone coming in to correct issues and do stuff, then you really haven't actually reduced anybody's workload. You just moved it to someone that needs to watch the robot all the time. And we see a lot of early stage deployments of all technology types get hung up in this sort of thing, where they can't achieve that reliability, then they never really produce a return on investment. So it's really important that we can build reliable hardware here, or
our robot making use of its mobility and its dynamic stability to be able to reach in, pick up these relatively heavy bins of metal parts without necessarily taking a lot of floor space.

S Speaker 15:35do the task, really do the task, and then safety. It is super important that safety be a core part of everything that we're doing here, because we're building capable robots, and with that comes robots that can exert very large forces on the world, both intentionally, to do their jobs and unintentionally, if something goes wrong, and safety is about more than just sort of saying, well, I'll go into it in a second, but it's about more than just a high level reasoning of like, yeah, the robot doesn't pick up the wrong tote or, you know, intentionally do something. It's really about reasoning about all of the different ways that you could have a failure that might not be your robot's fault at all. It might be something totally unrelated, and how are you going to deal with that to make sure that you don't end up creating a hazard? Some of the examples back here are what a robot might need to deal with in figuring out if there's a person in its environment. You know, a person where they're not supposed to be necessarily,

S Speaker 18:05All right, here's a robot that's going to have a failure. Wait for it, bam. That was it. Okay. So this robot was an RMA for my customer. It was having this problem where it was kind of walking around and then it would just fall right. And we thought, maybe it's a software bug. Maybe we're doing something silly. We checked all of our code. You know, this is a pretty big safety problem, right? Having a robot that unintentionally falls, right? So what did it end up being? It ended up being a stress fracture in a PCB to a power chain to an encoder, that led to a velocity glitch that happened only when the robot was in the process of moving its leg after 1000 steps had been happening, to wear it enough to cause this fracture, right? And so we think a lot about safety in terms of like the nominal operation the robot's walking around, and it decided to do something unsafe, like walk into a person or something. And that is important. You shouldn't do that. But when we're talking about safety in a Functional Safety Sense, in terms of what it would take to get millions of robots out there, we have to be reasoning about the non nominal operation as well, and agilities have to face this because we have robots out in the world. They do have non nominal conditions. We have things like batch manufacturing issues. And, you know, luckily for us, right? We have all of the functional safety of our work cells, such that when this event was happening, it was safely contained in a work cell the robot goes into, you know, a category one stop. It wasn't an issue for us as an inconvenience. But if you aren't thinking about this stuff holistically, right, there is a lot to think about with safety. So part of what we've been doing to address that is working on the ISO, 25785, working group, which is trying to build out safety requirements for industrial mobile robots with actively controlled stability, aka humanoids, or other balancing robots. And part of this is to figure out, you know, in situations like this, where there could be a hardware fault, there could be an environmental issue, right, there's an oil slick on the floor, right? How are we responding? How are we defining our safety strategy to make sure that we're not going to introduce a hazard to the surrounding folks, the surrounding environment? It's a hard problem. It's a very hard problem, but it's a necessary one for us to solve,
All right, here's a robot that's going to have a failure. Wait for it, bam. That was it. Okay. So this robot was an RMA for my customer.

And so we think a lot about safety in terms of like the nominal operation the robot's walking around, and it decided to do something unsafe, like walk into a person or something. And that is important. You shouldn't do that. But when we're talking about safety in a Functional Safety Sense, in terms of what it would take to get millions of robots out there, we have to be reasoning about the non nominal operation as well, and agilities have to face this because we have robots out in the world. They do have non nominal conditions. We have things like batch manufacturing issues. And, you know, luckily for us, right? We have all of the functional safety of our work cells, such that when this event was happening, it was safely contained in a work cell the robot goes into, you know, a category one stop. It wasn't an issue for us as an inconvenience. But if you aren't thinking about this stuff holistically, right, there is a lot to think about with safety. So part of what we've been doing to address that is working on the ISO, 25785, working group, which is trying to build out safety requirements for industrial mobile robots with actively controlled stability, aka humanoids, or other balancing robots. And part of this is to figure out, you know, in situations like this, where there could be a hardware fault, there could be an environmental issue, right, there's an oil slick on the floor, right? How are we responding? How are we defining our safety strategy to make sure that we're not going to introduce a hazard to the surrounding folks, the surrounding environment? It's a hard problem. It's a very hard problem, but it's a necessary one for us to solve,
All right, here's a robot that's going to have a failure. Wait for it, bam. That was it. Okay. So this robot was an RMA for my customer. It was having this problem where it was kind of walking around and then it would just fall right. And we thought, maybe it's a software bug. Maybe we're doing something silly. We checked all of our code. You know, this is a pretty big safety problem, right? Having a robot that unintentionally falls, right? So what did it end up being?

S Speaker 211:07you so much. So we are headed into our first networking break, so we're going to start promptly back up at 1045, so we came back, but do also.
