S Speaker 33:31a call like this is always good to have a face to the name and you know, but thanks, thanks for making that work festival and so real quick, right? So we are part of the strategic investment arm for Qualcomm. You know, this is our 25th year of investing. We invest across a lot of emerging tech areas with the focus on cybersecurity, right? So we've invested in, we were Series B investors in Sentinel one. We've we were earlier investors in Cloudflare. Then we've made a bunch of other investments, like cyberex, cynet. I have invested, one of my most recent investments was in a cyber security play. It was more focused on below the operating system supply chain, software supply chain called eclipses. They're based out of Portland. So we are, we double with this, with this whole notion that Priyesh and I, we, we are part of the North American team here, and we are working on this thesis about, how do you secure AI within an enterprise, right? And we are not talking about individual teams. We are talking about a broad based, you know, internal AI development, third party apps, or, you know, even like legacy apps, deploying their own AI features, right and right? And that introduces a new attack surface. But how do you protect it, right? So I think with this kind of resonated that sense, and I think a lot of and we are still mapping the space and understanding the different ways people are attacking the problem. But what was so super interesting is the sales side of witness, right, which, I think, you know, you you guys have cracked something with the enterprise. It's resonating, right? And the lands are, you know, I have to call it out. It's, it's something that I it's not usual to see such impressive lands, right? And this is mostly discover. I think the other two can be more expansion. But so that got us excited. My quick background, I'm, I've been with the ventures team for six years, but have been investing for 10 plus years. I have tech undergrad that started as a developer. So we can also unpack a little bit of the technical aspects, how you position it for your customers. But yeah, I mean, I focus a lot on infra software dev tools and cyber security and and, yeah, looking to looking to learn more, and happy to answer any questions, missile, if you have. But let's Priyesh introduce, and then we can, we can take it from there. While he's introducing, I'll just get my charger. I think my batteries will know I'll be back

S Speaker 16:10Pleasure to meet you. I'm a Senior Associate here in the team. I've been with the Fund for about a year and a half. Prior to that, I spent some time with Menlo Ventures and sometimes with some time with Morpheus, and then early career started out as an operator across multiple different startups, or startup grow from series A to unicorn. So that was a great experience. But now working with Deepak on our DevOps AI infra focus. Other than that, I focus on frontier AI applications.

go ahead. Yeah, sure. So
S Speaker 26:56I'll start from graduating undergrad, graduate undergrad from the University of Georgia, actually started as a individual. Contributor. I worked at E trade, etrade.com before you actually had, like a soccer security operations team. So I was able to do a bunch of different roles there, like a new college hire program, and where I fit in eventually was in security operations. Created security operations and engineering, and then actually architecture. We did essentially everything, soup to nuts, for security, for e trade at a time, there's four of us and our manager. So we would, you know, architect solutions, deploy them, and then operate them. Then after a while, we grew the network operations team to start managing tools. I was there for approximately four years, and every time I'd meet a vendor, they would say, hey, you need to go into the vendor space. You need to become like an SE. So one of the largest projects I had was deploying all the Ford proxies, for for E trade worldwide. And from there I went to, yeah, I went to web sense, and actually, you'll see there'll be kind of a little tie into what we're doing here. So we so I did that. I went over to web sense, and I was the first se there. First se that was a specific overlay SME to basically combat Bluecoat, because I deployed all the forward proxy for Bluecoat outside. So I did that as a subject matter expert for them. And then from there, I got recruited over to a company called Imperva. Remember them, web application, database administration. I was the first se on the East Coast for them. I was there for almost nine and a half years. Went from maybe 2 million maybe not even that. And that was that's not Arr, right, the it was different. We're selling appliances, so it's much lower. So basically, from 2 million ish all the way to we went IPO, and by the time I left there, I was running the entire SEO organization worldwide. And then from there, I went to a company called exaby, and if you've heard of them, and they use their behavioral analytics. And then sim space, I was the first sale rep there. So I changed roles, became a sales rep, and I was there for almost, almost 10 years, had various roles, from running regions and teams to being, you know, again, a direct contributor, starting off as running our, our, you know, strategic account team. So I had held different roles there as well. And then from there, I came here at witness. And it's going on year two for me. And where I came here, there was basically, you know, Figmas and ideation of what we're doing from a product perspective. And we started off by getting design feedback partners from there, going through a beta round, and then going GA and now we're on version 2.5 to roll out version three, and to answer your question Deepak, or your comment of like, how it's a little, you know, atypical about where we are and how we sell. I think there's two big reasons for it. One was when we were talking to a lot of these design feedback partners, we started at the fortune 500 level. So a lot of our design partners were those folks. So if you think about it, when you're building a product that's enterprise grade, you want to start there, and you want to build that enterprise grade products. It's easier to go downstream than go upstream. So that was our focus and our plan. It so happened that, you know, I do have lots of deep relationships with a lot of folks, so I was able to get those design feedback partners. So that's how we started it. But that was purposeful. I think it was purposeful for Rick to bring me here to do that right, to kind of build out, to go to market. So that's what we did, and that's where, you know, when you look at why we're getting traction. I think we have a very strong go to market team. Absolutely, we have a strong product too, yeah, but also, we purposely built this product for that space, and I think it's very different, because I've worked at, as you saw, two other startups. We just wanted to get in anywhere you could validate the product. We did it differently. We're thoughtful around, you know, you know, especially around the design feedback and then the beta round, right? Like we wanted to really figure out how we built this product. So it's not, you know, vaporware. Does that make sense?

I went over to web sense, and I was the first se there. First se that was a specific overlay SME to basically combat Bluecoat, because I deployed all the forward proxy for Bluecoat outside. So I did that as a subject matter expert for them. And then from there, I got recruited over to a company called Imperva. Remember them, web application, database administration. I was the first se on the East Coast for them. I was there for almost nine and a half years. Went from maybe 2 million maybe not even that. And that was that's not Arr, right, the it was different. We're selling appliances, so it's much lower. So basically, from 2 million ish all the way to we went IPO, and by the time I left there, I was running the entire SEO organization worldwide. And then from there, I went to a company called exaby, and if you've heard of them, and they use their behavioral analytics. And then sim space, I was the first sale rep there. So I changed roles, became a sales rep, and I was there for almost, almost 10 years, had various roles, from running regions and teams to being, you know, again, a direct contributor, starting off as running our, our, you know, strategic account team. So I had held different roles there as well. And then from there, I came here at witness. And it's going on year two for me. And where I came here, there was basically, you know, Figmas and ideation of what we're doing from a product perspective. And we started off by getting design feedback partners from there, going through a beta round, and then going GA and now we're on version 2.5 to roll out version three, and to answer your question Deepak, or your comment of like, how it's a little, you know, atypical about where we are and how we sell. I think there's two big reasons for it. One was when we were talking to a lot of these design feedback partners, we started at the fortune 500 level. So a lot of our design partners were those folks. So if you think about it, when you're building a product that's enterprise grade, you want to start there, and you want to build that enterprise grade products. It's easier to go downstream than go upstream. So that was our focus and our plan. It so happened that, you know, I do have lots of deep relationships with a lot of folks, so I was able to get those design feedback partners. So that's how we started it. But that was purposeful. I think it was purposeful for Rick to bring me here to do that right, to kind of build out, to go to market. So that's what we did, and that's where, you know, when you look at why we're getting traction. I think we have a very strong go to market team. Absolutely, we have a strong product too, yeah, but also, we purposely built this product for that space, and I think it's very different, because I've worked at, as you saw, two other startups. We just wanted to get in anywhere you could validate the product. We did it differently. We're thoughtful around, you know, you know, especially around the design feedback and then the beta round, right? Like we wanted to really figure out how we built this product. So it's not, you know, vaporware. Does that make sense?
I'll start from graduating undergrad, graduate undergrad from the University of Georgia, actually started as a individual. Contributor. I worked at E trade, etrade.com before you actually had, like a soccer security operations team. So I was able to do a bunch of different roles there, like a new college hire program, and where I fit in eventually was in security operations. Created security operations and engineering, and then actually architecture. We did essentially everything, soup to nuts, for security, for e trade at a time, there's four of us and our manager. So we would, you know, architect solutions, deploy them, and then operate them. Then after a while, we grew the network operations team to start managing tools. I was there for approximately four years, and every time I'd meet a vendor, they would say, hey, you need to go into the vendor space. You need to become like an SE. So one of the largest projects I had was deploying all the Ford proxies, for for E trade worldwide. And from there I went to, yeah, I went to web sense, and actually, you'll see there'll be kind of a little tie into what we're doing here. So we so I did that.

S Speaker 215:31right? Yes, so yeah, so think of us of a highly scalable platform, right? We're different AI engines that you can apply, right? We use AI in our own site that you can apply towards the consumer model side or internal employees and governance around it. So different. We have different, highly scalable engine that we can apply depending. You know, that's why we built that platform, as I was mentioned. So you look at NTT DATA, there's

S Speaker 216:56I'll talk about delta really quick. And expand potential is going to talk it's going to really resonate with NTT. So yeah, with Delta specifically, there's a couple things, right? So we on the user side, we we license per user. So on Delta specifically, we are only doing 50,000 users. Delta is 100,000 user organizations. So one, we have an upsell opportunity, just on users, right? Just easy, just on users. And then we have the concept of different guardrails that you can add to protect right? So depending on what they want to do, and we're working on that, there were no time until January. But, for example, we've talked to them about all the different ones we have, like, we just released, you know, the most recent guardrails, or PCI guardrail that's somewhat of interest for them, right? There's the harmful response. There's different things we can do around that. Even on the Chatbot side, there's more guardrails that we can sell them. So there's opportunity. That's the whole plan is to get in and then, you know, you know, expand it out. So does that make sense? On Delta, definitely

There's, there's there's witness for employees, there's witness for developers. Then they can do a la carte, different guardrail so like DCI one, if they want to add that, there's a charge for that, right? So we can, we can upsell constantly. That's the idea. As we release new features, release new guardrails, we can sell that, and that's both on the model side and as well as the employee governance. So we can do it on both. So it gives us more streams of revenue

S Speaker 218:24focus was just the user side. They don't have any chat bots right now. They have none of that. And same kind of thing. But they're a massive organization. Delta is huge, right? And Steve bigger, like probably the largest, top three telcos in the world, same kind of thing for them they wanted to do observability and visibility. A directive came down from the board, and the CISO said, No, Wales, no. Ai threw that in, and we're able to deploy them in a much more complicated environment, three different Zscaler instances, all rolling out of a tenant out of Europe, and that's how we have them deployed. Got them up and running in less than 10 days, 150,000 users to just talk about expansion there. They just want a new visibility for they had a they accelerated this from budgeting timeframe as well, so we were able to get that in. Now they're fully in on guardrails. We're discussing expanding them on all different guardrails, because they're just observable. Not only there, we are in the midst of closing NTT Japan, another 65,000 users, and it's going to go the same way. They're going to do visibility for this quarter, and then we're going to do guardrails, hopefully by the end of this year, if not going into q1 right? So that's just going into these large enterprises. You're right. It's more painful in terms of, there's a lot more to do, but the revenue opportunities are great. As long as you can service them and provide them good service and obviously, a good product, they don't have the opportunity to get recurring revenue outside of just renewals, right? And what

I don't because of the reason is because there a lot of them are not in these large enterprises. We don't see like, prior to Cato acquiring aim security, we didn't really see them.

Now, you got to remember, we're doing it on two different sides. Right on the model side, I'm seeing Palo Alto and I'm seeing Google model armor. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yeah. We just, actually just finished a POC in Latin America, which very large airline in Latin America. We were double digits ahead in terms of percentages on efficacy for detection over both of them, and our latency was much better. So that's on the model side. So I'm seeing them more often, seeing them more often on the employee governance side, I am seeing Zscaler more because of just their you know, deployments right out there, that they're a major proxy out there, and they're just adding this on, but it's just the mainly, it's the DLP focus thing. We're doing a lot around intention. I don't know if you know you talked about,

So I'm seeing them more often, seeing them more often on the employee governance side, I am seeing Zscaler more because of just their you know, deployments right out there, that they're a major proxy out there, and they're just adding this on, but it's just the mainly, it's the DLP focus thing. We're doing a lot around intention. I don't know if you know you talked about,
Yeah, not the club. In terms of, probably feature parity. I'll probably say aim is probably the closest in terms of now, where we see deals. Now, you got to remember, we're doing it on two different sides. Right on the model side, I'm seeing Palo Alto and I'm seeing Google model armor. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yeah.

But my question, I think, is, like, you know, from a from a differentiation standpoint, right? Today, I think before the acquisitions, they were, there was nobody that directly competed with you. Maybe these were design partners, and, you know, you kind of

We would see but you're we would see him, yeah, but you, if you're talking about consistently seeing them, right, we wouldn't see them. Now I'm seeing Z scalar a lot.

S Speaker 328:09And that's unweighted and and I had, I had a few more questions right focused on this one is a the budget, where it comes from as a writer, so today, I don't know if CISO has an AI book security budget. It might be coming from vulnerability management or data DLP protection, right? You might be taking it away from I don't know if there's an additional budget that's been deployed that might be different when it's coming through channel. Maybe channel is packaging it in a bundle with tools to do a more comprehensive solution. But where do you see like, are you seeing allocations or even budgeting cycles, factoring that a million dollars for a large enterprise will be spent on just employee visibility? It's not a small number, so it has to and once that happens, is a big unlock, right? Once every enterprise start thinking that, hey, my next, you know, fiscal year, I want to make sure that I have, you know, the capital to protect my AI deployments within the company. That's a different conversation altogether with an enterprise, right? Yeah, 100%
And that's unweighted and and I had, I had a few more questions right focused on this one is a the budget, where it comes from as a writer, so today, I don't know if CISO has an AI book security budget.

S Speaker 229:12so, so just, just to go back like we're just not only the employee governance, right? So we also do the chat bots, and there's ROI, there's money associated with that, right? So, of course, we're seeing acceleration and deals and opportunities around that another very large hotel chain. We're working with them on the employee governance side, and all of a sudden the CISO came to me, who I know, is like, hey, we have this chat bot that's being released. We need to protect it now, right? And that's another one where we we went up against Paulo and model armor and beat them both. So far, are the results are in our favor from a technical perspective. So just just the one I want to make sure I call that out, but in terms of what you're asking for, in line item budgets, there are line item budgets that are being budgeted for for next year. There are already some that already had it for this year. We're seeing a lot more for next year as they're budgeting, and we're in budget season now. Yeah, that's happening. Yeah. The other thing is that you mentioned, like, it's a board and a C suite type conversation. So I've been at other startups before where you're creating a market, you're basically evangelizing creating market. We don't have to do that at all. Everybody understand that problem? Yeah? Every security executive or identity person that we talked to or legal person we talked to, yeah, they're like, I don't need to create a budget. I can go get it. I can get it somehow, because the board understands, like, I don't have to tell them about deepsea people know, I don't need to tell about copilot. They understand this. This is not, you know, going back to my days at X Men Women for creating a category of user and NC behavior analytics, there's been 40 minutes trying to explain what this does, right? Same thing with an early WAFF or a damn. They're like, I'm talking horns coming out of my head, right?
so, so just, just to go back like we're just not only the employee governance, right? So we also do the chat bots, and there's ROI, there's money associated with that, right?

And I'm not just saying that it's a very aggressive number, right? For our first year of full sales, very aggressive. I think we have, we have a quite a good path that, if you look at this quarter right now, we have approximately 450,000 booked. We should Eclipse let me give a range here, right? My cut for this quarter is easily over a million to maybe 1.5 up to maybe two, depending on how some things break right, depending on timing for the year, I feel confident we'll hit six. Best case, maybe, maybe up to 7 million, depending on what happens all the way through q4 that's what I'm thinking. Six to seven. I think we'll
So we're at 3.4 million. AR trailing right now, right? We are. Our target is 6 million. I feel very confident that we'll hit that. And I'm not just saying that it's a very aggressive number, right?

S Speaker 332:49hit our if you do to this quarter, 1.5 this quarter, that kind of release some pressure from q4 right? Hopefully, and maybe, can we talk about some of the deals you know, off the top of your mind, or if you have an Excel, or if you have something that we can walk through.
hit our if you do to this quarter, 1.5 this quarter, that kind of release some pressure from q4 right? Hopefully, and maybe, can we talk about some of the deals you know, off the top of your mind, or if you have an Excel, or if you have something that we can walk through.

S Speaker 333:19I think the point is not to is not to, how should I say we just, we just want to assess the confidence levels and have some background around different conversations. You can, you know, as long as you mentioned, it's like a top five hotel, that's exactly, yeah, yeah, that's fine. No worries. Yeah, so,
I think the point is not to is not to, how should I say we just, we just want to assess the confidence levels and have some background around different conversations. You can, you know, as long as you mentioned, it's like a top five hotel, that's exactly, yeah, yeah, that's fine. No worries. Yeah, so,

S Speaker 233:37yeah. So let's start with probably the largest utility in North America. We have a deal with them that we we've agreed on in MSA, there's some things that we have to do on our side that looks pretty likely for this quarter. The add on for NCT, like I mentioned, NTT Japan looks solid. We have a large, a large car manufacturer. We were finalizing a deal with them.
yeah. So let's start with probably the largest utility in North America. We have a deal with them that we we've agreed on in MSA, there's some things that we have to do on our side that looks pretty likely for this quarter.

S Speaker 334:01So this is super interesting. We have a big automotive business. When you say a large car manufacturer, what? Again, the use case is similar, which is,
So this is super interesting. We have a big automotive business. When you say a large car manufacturer, what? Again, the use case is similar, which is,

So if you can, if you can, correlate,
So if you can, if you can, correlate,
So if you can, if you can, correlate,
S Speaker 234:18yeah, the large utility is user governance, yeah, the entity is user governance. Car manufacturers is model protection. Yeah, we have another airline that's both, that's in Central America, very large. We're in contract negotiate MSA negotiations with them currently that would be both model and user.
yeah, the large utility is user governance, yeah, the entity is user governance. Car manufacturers is model protection.

S Speaker 234:47medium sized hedge fund that's looking at us on the user side, a large hotel chain that is model protection only, and other Latin American, South American Airlines that is only model protection. So you'll see there's a good mix here. But then we have some other ones, insurance company that's in play, that is just user governance. We also have a technology manufacturing company, let's call it that. They are also just on the user side. And then some couple smaller opportunities, another larger one that is just on the on the user side, so that it's a mix. Sorry, I'm just looking at my Salesforce next. It's quite a, quite a good mix, right? So, and the, you know, we have a, we have a pretty strong pipeline for this quarter. So, you know, we have over, I mean, over 2 million. That's been very conservative. The way we forecast, everything is quite conservative. We want to be right conservative. Even our pipeline is conservative, right. We have over 2 million in active pipe that we can potentially close this quarter, just this quarter of this is this quarter. Yeah, got it. Got it. No, that gives at least a good sense of you might get closer to six, 6.5 right? If a lot of things align, you never say never, say, Never, right?
medium sized hedge fund that's looking at us on the user side, a large hotel chain that is model protection only, and other Latin American, South American Airlines that is only model protection. So you'll see there's a good mix here. But then we have some other ones, insurance company that's in play, that is just user governance.

S Speaker 337:18Got it? No, that's, that's super impressive, right? And, and I know this, sales people don't like forecasting beyond but I have to ask you, like, let's say you hit six, right? What do you have for 2026 right? Ending, chat, 2027 Yeah, just high level. You know what, what you feel. And maybe you know, I know you conservative. You probably talk numbers only. What's in the Salesforce, but where do you see this land, right? And what's your view?
Got it? No, that's, that's super impressive, right? And, and I know this, sales people don't like forecasting beyond but I have to ask you, like, let's say you hit six, right?

37:45Yeah, yeah. So, I mean, I
Yeah, yeah. So, I mean, I
Yeah, yeah. So, I mean, I
Yeah, yeah. So, I mean, I
S Speaker 237:50hope Rick doesn't hear this. I don't, I don't think I understand growth is completely out of the question. If we can execute higher enough and get them ramped and get them going, right? I think, yeah, yeah. We have capacity models for veteran reps. Non veteran reps, we have to do a haircut on, you know, the new international expansion, you know, I think, I think the all the ingredients are there to do that. That's, that's what we're trying to focus on, is under percent growth, 12 million new Arr, next year. It's a very aggressive goal. I think it's possible if we do all the right things, hire ramp, enable do all of that as soon as possible. Right? It takes, takes six to nine months minimum, to get a get a rep ramp and going right. But then all the cascading down supporting functions, the SES marketing, there's a lot to it, all the way into the product and engineering. So, but if we could do that, I I think by what did net scope file? When they're asked one, they just went public, they said that this space is a $30 billion total addressable market, I think, right, okay, yeah. So, I mean, it's there, it's it's there, it depends on how we execute. So I don't think that's out of the question. Is something that we're, that's what we're, that's our goals, right? And, of

S Speaker 239:22quota, hearing that what? So, yes, yeah. So, so it's basically one before, yeah. So, right now it's one per per rep. Basically, right. Yeah, right. So next year, depending on the, you know, there's a yield in the quota, we expect the yield for the veteran reps to be about 1.3 you know, sign a little haircut for over signing, take a haircut on some of this international expansion. We can get to our 1.2 million. I mean, our $12 million number, excuse me, where we had basically eight more reps quarter, carrying reps, having about 12,

S Speaker 241:21So it depends on the on the vertical, right. So you have look at hospitality, right? It could be a large hotel chain. They have, let's say, 300,000 employees, but not all of them are not knowledge workers. Same thing with like Delta Airlines. Not everybody's going to be logging in and accessing AI. They could be folks on the on the jet ways, right? Baggage handlers. So there is part of that. So entity specifically there, there's Entity Data, Inc, right? That puts the entire globe, but then there's a different units, right? So entity, Japan is its own unit. We're doing 65,000 just with that 5000 users. So it depends on the on the industry. It really depends. So with Delta, they started with 50,000 we probably can increase that, but they still have a lot of folks that are not necessarily using from an employee governance side. They're going to be using AI. They're going to be baggage handlers.
