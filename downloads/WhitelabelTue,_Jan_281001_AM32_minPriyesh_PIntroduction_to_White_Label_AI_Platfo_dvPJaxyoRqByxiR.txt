S Speaker 31:03yeah, I think it's, I think the reason because I was really like, toy, you're NSF, right? Yes, no. I think the reason I was toying is like, it depends what kind of businesses you're doing. I think there's a so many, like services business that are trying to automate with knowledge management or whatever that it's it's good to be close to be close to the customers sometimes, you know, right?

S Speaker 33:49No, I think, I think it sounds good. I think it'd be nice to get a reflection. Like, if you're looking at AI agents in the application level, was there anything recently that you're just, like, I don't know, like, where you're seeing, kind of the market tailor itself too. I mean, it's fascinating. You know, the upset some stuff made recently, like with AI operator and stuff like that. You seen any shifts when you're talking to funds.

S Speaker 35:32Okay, cool, perfect. Do you want to give a little bit of an introduction of who we are, what we're up to?

S Speaker 35:40free to stop me on the time, and I'm happy to show you a little bit of products as well as just to give you a flavor of it. But yeah, really quick background. So me and my co founder worked together for six to six, seven years, and we built our first company, actually as a services business. So we're effectively being asked to kind of bring ring fence federal money and support in building the strategy and the investment in the investment kind of applications, and then evaluate the success of those projects. Yeah, and that was everything from investment in tourism projects, health projects, place making projects, all sorts of stuff. And I guess our USP was, you know, being able to actually communicate an investment pot at a city level, whether that's for politicians, communities, investors, or whatever that might be. But to be honest with you, about 18 months ago, we decided we didn't want to die at F still 70, trying to build a boutique delight. Then the natural kind of pivot was to x pop pipeline and our services business, which we did, and focus on, how do we productize what we've learned? And the thesis of white label really is built off of that experience. And whilst there's a lot of knowledge management apps in the market right now, there's none that really focus on externally focused knowledge work and like managing relationships at scale. And what I mean by that is things like investor relations, sales relations, and dealing with a bunch of unstructured data that needs to be effectively communicated out well. And there's a ton of workflows out there that are very fragmented stakeholder base, but it's important for the user to get really close to that mass, confidential audience, and where we kind of started that journey is because of our experience, was just looking at particularly investor relations. So just to start with and what we were finding, and I'll show you an example, is there's a heap of unstructured data, like a deal room on steroids, or how do you get a Gen ticket creating the next investment memo? Or what might that be? And that's our kind of laser focus right now, just to build a bit of a moat and get to traction. But there's really simple, obvious applications of how that transfers. I was one with a shipping and logistics company this morning, which have just paid for a beta after seeing the platform and what they're using it for, even though it's identical to investor relations, is take all the shipping unstructured data, communicate that out for the auditors, or even back to the recipients that are shipping their goods, if that makes sense. So there's many different applications, but our later focus right now is looking at fundraising. And how do you get closer to effectively close a thumb around, communicate the deal as we build out early traction. And it's obviously the proof is in show and tell. So I'm happy to show it for two minutes and then just so you get a feel for it, absolutely you can ask it. Well, yeah, let
free to stop me on the time, and I'm happy to show you a little bit of products as well as just to give you a flavor of it. But yeah, really quick background.

S Speaker 28:39while you do that, Ralph, you mentioned, the focus right now is on fundraising, but not as much, I would say, on report in for investments, to report it back to their investors, or any of those applications.

S Speaker 38:53We've got real early traction on early deal flow and like the funds fundraising, so naturally, we've pivoted that way. And because we've just, we're just really staying close to the early customers. And then if there's an obvious overlap between 10 investment funds, then it's an obvious thing to build out. If that makes sense, to stay more sticky. We have been asked for the fund that I'm just about to show you is to basically take over their investment portal space of like, can we just take these PDFs of quarterly performance and update our lps on specific deals and so that's more around data enrichment. So either overlaying how they're getting that performance data or attaching to their CRM to be able to steal that or whatever that might be, show you a very quick use case example. So have you ever heard of these guys? By any chance? They're like a private equity investment platform.

S Speaker 316:47Correct? So everything that you saw in White was like them sharing it with their IPs, yeah, everything in blue was the investor relations team, right? So where we're getting the traction from is the clients on the blue side saying we can't handle all of these stakeholders. Let's make their life easier, but also we'll learn from the interactions and the chat history and asset management, seems the obvious industry to focus in on, because it's repeatable. So it's the most traction has been the VC funds with large LP bases and private equity investment platforms that kind of space syndicates

S Speaker 217:25call it on your traction page. I also saw unstructured what's a startup like that doing in terms of using white label today? Yeah, we're
call it on your traction page. I also saw unstructured what's a startup like that doing in terms of using white label today? Yeah, we're

S Speaker 219:02Yeah, that makes sense. That's pretty interesting. I was a little bit curious, but that makes a lot of sense. Having them as an partner makes a lot of sense. That's that's very interesting. So you are very focused on becoming the front end layer here. You wouldn't down the line, sort of go into deep data analysis
Yeah, that makes sense. That's pretty interesting. I was a little bit curious, but that makes a lot of sense. Having them as an partner makes a lot of sense. That's that's very interesting.

S Speaker 220:48Ralph and today for you to partner with some of those SaaS companies, let's say we have a bunch of them in our portfolio. So I'm just thinking from that angle, what kind of data sources would you need from them, and where can you integrate directly on what layer?

S Speaker 321:03Yeah, it depends. So either at the data lake level and working on that, on that side of stuff, or depending how they're structured, if they're generating the PDF, so to speak, the unstructured data is just passing that via API directly into the library. Yeah, and obviously the branding and the platforms could be really connected between that process.

S Speaker 224:08It was interesting earlier to note that you're thinking about data mode. Can you explain that a little bit more to me? And how does that sort of

24:18compound over yours as you bring in more clients?
compound over yours as you bring in more clients?
compound over yours as you bring in more clients?
compound over yours as you bring in more clients?
S Speaker 225:29get a part of that, Ralph, I get the fact that if, let's say, you have an analytics dashboard on top of it, that's a valuable data point to give the client back, how are you using those data points to sort of reiterate on the product? And I understand it, it will give you some indications on where should the product go in its next iteration. But how are you improving the entire product use based on that? Yeah,

S Speaker 325:56it's really good. So many silly things, like, right now, really tiny things are like, you know, clicking a document in our in our product, but then has to go to a new tab of a video player. And that sounds so really silly, but just seeing the post op way that that's used, we're like, why aren't we embedding, you know, mixed media into our knowledge portals or whatever, right the way through to we're actually searching the chat history, refining that in prompt layer, and then we're running tests on the questions. So this shouldn't have responded about ESG in this way, it didn't pull the right facts and figures, or it didn't show facts and figures. Let's refine our prompt so that's a more constructive answer. So we're using it really deep in prompt engineering, right the way through to functionality, what's needed next, and stuff like that. If that kind of answers your question,
it's really good. So many silly things, like, right now, really tiny things are like, you know, clicking a document in our in our product, but then has to go to a new tab of a video player. And that sounds so really silly, but just seeing the post op way that that's used, we're like, why aren't we embedding, you know, mixed media into our knowledge portals or whatever, right the way through to we're actually searching the chat history, refining that in prompt layer, and then we're running tests on the questions. So this shouldn't have responded about ESG in this way, it didn't pull the right facts and figures, or it didn't show facts and figures. Let's refine our prompt so that's a more constructive answer.

S Speaker 327:18Yeah? Really good question. So I think the serious network effect opportunity here, so like, the, there's the unstructured partnership play, then there's stuff, like, you know, Yale was sending us out to 10,000 alumni or moon fair, sending it to, you know, 71,000 LPS that are from private equity, yeah. So we're being really subtle on, like, notifications, like, how was this powered? How was this built? So it's product led sales. On that front, we're driving a lot. We're going to drive a lot of building momentum, because some of our clients are putting this, like, front and center on their websites with, you know, 100,000 clicks a month. There's a lot of product led growth. And then one of our key hires will be testing certain duty GTM. So like growth led marketing, very specific to private equity and venture capital space and stuff like that, we want to hit naught to two. Effectively, we're on the trajectory of nought to two this year. That would allow us to say right at 2 million. We found market fit. We've really defines that IP in that mode, and then we can start thinking about how we bridge and build the market and the TAM based on leaping into into other industries, if that makes sense. It

S Speaker 228:25does. It does. Thanks a lot for that. Yeah. I guess my last question here would be, how big a round Are you raising? How deep are you. You in that already? Is there a timeline that you're looking at?
does. It does. Thanks a lot for that. Yeah. I guess my last question here would be, how big a round Are you raising? How deep are you. You in that already? Is there a timeline that you're looking at?

S Speaker 328:38Yeah, so we only started raising just before Christmas. Are you starting the process? So we're only about three or four weeks in. We've actually just this week, been offered our first term sheet, which would be around a million co invest, which is exciting to start the process like to raise around 2.5 to 2.75 something like that, which would give a strong two months runway, very focused on go to market and building out the use cases and the features we know we don't have. So basically, it's just fueling the engineering team. There's six of us at the moment, while I'm working for swear, you know, a very lean burn like 50k a month at the moment, so it's just about bringing some engineering talent in. Don't really need to scale much more than that, but until we get the right stickiness on those low hanging markets and use cases and. And yeah. So two months are on my first round. We've bootstrapped so far, but based on our exit and a little bit of angel money, through some strategic angels that wanted to come in, in our effort,

S Speaker 229:41understood Ralph and so you say 2.7 roughly one of it is more or less committed. Congrats on the term sheet, though you just started, and it's great to see the first term sheet coming in within a month. That's that's very exciting. So 2.7 Roughly about a million of that committed, would you have the capacity to sort of increase the round side a little bit, if that's the need,

S Speaker 330:05of course, and because there's even though it's a decent sized term sheet, if we go with that fund there, it's not like they're seeing themselves of having to be the lead so we have the right lead investor, we would like to actually build the round out with them, for obvious reasons, and making sure, I'm sure there'll be some other investors that maybe want to bring for very specific strategic. Reasons, like building our pipeline faster or, yeah, so we would just shape around the right lead when we get that feeling.

S Speaker 231:11Yeah, absolutely. That'd be great, Ralph, and then I can get back to you by the end of this week with the next steps on our end.

S Speaker 331:17Okay, that sounds fantastic. Was really lovely to meet you and yeah. And the other thing, just to say, you know, there's a really obvious use case, even within yourselves, like, do let me know. Like, we're always excited to, like, build out an off. An obvious use case, seeing as you're one of the first kind of customer markets we're looking at, and if there's a different fund that you're like, they would love this absolutely.

S Speaker 231:41I do see a lot of. Of use cases that we can adopt ourselves and over the time, I guess over the last years, we have been experimenting with a few of services out there haven't really. Really found something which is credible enough for us to completely adopt, but I believe I would give it a try and come back to you on that aspect as well. Yeah,

S Speaker 332:01well, keep, keep that in mind, and then come back with a good use case, and then at least we can try that absolutely.
