S Speaker 10:26your wife is here. She's here. She was here. She went back to India. She'll come back by the end of this month. Again, it's a very different world than LA, for sure, but I guess getting into the job life being here looks fine, at least for the kind of job I'm trying to do to skill here.

S Speaker 11:00It's hybrid, in a sense. I don't need to go into the office, but there are times job, the team meets, we discuss deals and also and work. I was expecting it to be quite light. It's not that way. Coffee. Sara Kucha, it's not easy, man. It's not easy, like you get in founders from all across the space, and you have to be better well researched than them, like the people who are about their company, and they have been building it for years, and you have to say, Naini, I don't think this will work, and this will work, and this is how it should be, and things like that. So yeah, there's a lot of learning, and I think the learning curve is quite steep right now. With being good, it's a good challenge, I guess.

S Speaker 21:55Again, I thought it would be like being an unpaid internship. I thought it would be light, but light covid, I just thank you so much for taking time out Absolutely. But we are what we are doing, inspire AI. I think you must have overdo it, because they keep coming to UCLA, yeah,

S Speaker 12:17yeah. I think they were also in EAS fair, if I'm
S Speaker 13:48this right, right platform? Tell me a little bit on where does the workflow and on the recruiter side. Is it AI based interviews, is it finding the right candidate, selecting them, filtering them kind of thing? Yes, it is.

S Speaker 24:10So the process should end like the workflow should end on the recruiting side. Actually, it should not be ending. It is a loop. It is supposed to be like the loop where are entered into a system. Yeah, you have your job description and everything. Take care what you're trying to recruit for, what you're looking for. And then it filters resumes and candidates, and it it also has this feature called Theo, spies, for example, people who are in the system. And deep match is one feature that we're trying to sell the hardest, because from all the 100,000 resumes Jovi here it will curate it to 1015, people who match very deeply with what you're trying to do. And it is reinforcing, self reinforcing. It keeps understanding from the decision that it is making.

S Speaker 25:10then it, it does the deep match. It sends up, for example, if it sees that there are some gaps in your resume with respect to the job description and stuff, it will also send automated questions to make sure interviews are very clear. And then there's an AI interview component to it, which is like a pre interview interview that takes the their AI bottle, take your interview, and then it does a proper, you know, debrief on that interview to the recruiter, from soft skills to hard skills, everything, right? And was it relevant? Not relevant. And then eventually, what happens is, after that round, usually people take a one on one interview as well. Okay, yeah, and they stay in the system. After that, the candidates, irrespective of whether they get selected, not selected, they stay in the system. So future, for example, a job description, rejected candidate match here, yes,
then it, it does the deep match. It sends up, for example, if it sees that there are some gaps in your resume with respect to the job description and stuff, it will also send automated questions to make sure interviews are very clear.

S Speaker 16:18you will propel it to right. Right makes sense. Got it. And I can imagine and like, correct me if I'm wrong, but I can imagine it being a horizontal solution. Targeting all the possible industries would be very difficult, especially if you're doing a deep match kind of thing. So are there any specific industry, specific type of job profiles that you're targeting right now, right now
you will propel it to right. Right makes sense. Got it. And I can imagine and like, correct me if I'm wrong, but I can imagine it being a horizontal solution. Targeting all the possible industries would be very difficult, especially if you're doing a deep match kind of thing.

So are there any specific industry, specific type of job profiles that you're targeting right now, right now
7:16So those are the two things that we targeted primarily.
So those are the two things that we targeted primarily.
So those are the two things that we targeted primarily.
So those are the two things that we targeted primarily.
9:42in terms of scale, finding the perfect fit, yeah,
S Speaker 29:46even the two things that I told you, the two segments that we are targeting, both have opposite needs, HR and staffing firms. Yes, scale is the game, right? Yeah. But for startups, it is finding deep matches out there that is the unique selling proposition, that is our main value addition. So I think for now, like from whatever discussions we've been having, the current focus is to ensure the perfect fit, right? Because filtering, but currently
even the two things that I told you, the two segments that we are targeting, both have opposite needs, HR and staffing firms. Yes, scale is the game, right? Yeah. But for startups, it is finding deep matches out there that is the unique selling proposition, that is our main value addition.

S Speaker 110:30Yeah, that makes sense. I think if you are really to make that company successful scale with a bottle, finding the perfect fit can give you some long term, lifetime value, I guess, bro, it's, it's a very typical catch 22 other situation wherein, or the cold start problem, is what it's called, typically in startup languages, is like, it's a two sided marketplace, in a way, And then you have a platform in between to perfectly filter and connect people. And you have to figure out one side of the marketplace which would scale faster, and if, right now, bringing revenue is the goal, then which would where there is a high willingness to pay, in a sense, MATLAB, I can imagine, if you have 100,000 potential candidates on a platform, and I am recruiting, I would definitely give my needs to you, or on the other sense, if you have 100 job applications open, a lot of candidates would come in. But dono side of the marketplace, Mr. Kiss a side. Ko target Karna could be the solution here, and then you'll have to find a wedge on how do you target that segment very effectively, and how do you onboard a lot of those people very soon. To me, it seems like having the applicants profile on the portal even after he has been rejected or not selected for a role. Means key you guys are trying to sort of generate a very large pool of candidates that you have on your platform and then leverage that to sell it to recruiters. Is that correct? In a way,
Yeah, that makes sense. I think if you are really to make that company successful scale with a bottle, finding the perfect fit can give you some long term, lifetime value, I guess, bro, it's, it's a very typical catch 22 other situation wherein, or the cold start problem, is what it's called, typically in startup languages, is like, it's a two sided marketplace, in a way, And then you have a platform in between to perfectly filter and connect people.

S Speaker 113:16why don't you do something like this? Why don't you scrape all the job portals that you have. Maybe have an AI agent do that for you. Website to spread all was great. Gregor was job portal. Job application, even if the startup is not giving you that officially, just scrape it out from their websites, from a lot of VCs, which have their own website where all of their portfolio companies list their jobs and scrapings, they create a very robust database of these startups hiring in these profiles, and this is the link to apply. And based on that job description, start matching candidates already. And once you have matched those candidates, you have, let's say, a series B, company, product management, role, 10 candidates from my profile pool, which fit well with that, start reaching out to startups. Okay,
why don't you do something like this? Why don't you scrape all the job portals that you have. Maybe have an AI agent do that for you. Website to spread all was great. Gregor was job portal.

Okay,
S Speaker 214:13that makes sense. Actually hold out each other. Yeah, you're right. You're right. We could like do something. Like that, completely spray for job portals and stuff, and see,
that makes sense. Actually hold out each other. Yeah, you're right. You're right. We could like do something. Like that, completely spray for job portals and stuff, and see,

S Speaker 114:28yeah. And a good point to start there would be to find some of these big venture capital firms or UNK website. My Y Combinator has this. I'm sure a 16 Z would have it. Bessemer would have it. Khosla ventures would have it. So buddy venture funds website may all of their portfolio companies list their jobs, and Yeon K for profile me a subject out there. So that would be a good place to like scrape it in scale. And all of these companies are funded by great investors, so they have good capital they can spend on talent be raised. Their prime need would be to spending on talent so they would be willing to entertain you way more than a random startup. I'd say, okay, okay.

S Speaker 215:22They then I can actually start off by looking at these VC funds, and then, yeah, you're right. That's
They then I can actually start off by looking at these VC funds, and then, yeah, you're right. That's

S Speaker 115:32about targeting approach, and then reach out to these guys, say that, Hey, I saw you are raising a year, and yeah, I have five candidates filtered for you, and based on our AI system, I think these days match, because reason, fine tune that. Mail a little bit. Send it to someone in the team agar, if it is series A or lower, then sending it to the founder makes sense, because founders coffees are involved with hiring me Series B work, and they have HR team direct to the product or director of product or covid, I guess that will make sense. And at the same time, let's say, if you have scraped all of these startups, and you have, I'd say, 400 500 job opportunities from startups on your portal. Also start reaching out to guys like Parker or buki Sarek, jagepi, whoever are these guys, the career centers, and say that we have a portal. Just send out an email to your guys and have them register on our platform so that you have both sides of the marketplace working together.
