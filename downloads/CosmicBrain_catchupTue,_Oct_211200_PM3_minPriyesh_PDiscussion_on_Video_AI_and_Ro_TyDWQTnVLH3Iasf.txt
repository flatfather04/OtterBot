S Speaker 10:00To after a long, long time, absolutely I remember the last one was really interesting. We just couldn't make up our mind for this early stage. But yeah, I also met one of your co founders at one of the meta events. We had a good chat around some things that are happening in video AI and robotics and things like that. So, yeah, awesome.

S Speaker 20:24Yeah. I think lot of lot has changed after, like, we talked like, we have actually launched the product that, like, started general revenue, and why not be doing a $2 million seed round as well? Like, still, like, on the on racing side. Is this something that aligns with your current interest. Or is this so too early for you

S Speaker 10:44guys? It would be early handle. Given the check size, I think we would be more comfortable writing a five to $7 million check in, say, at around series A so when you're raising something upwards of $15 million around, that would be our sweet spot. We have done some seed but it's like our seed muscle is still developing. We're just sort of trying to understand the space so we don't take a lot of seed beds at the moment.

S Speaker 21:09God, it sounds good. Well, I'd love to invite you to one of our fight clubs. So we organized a lot of robot fights. Yeah, we have been getting a lot of passion. We got like 100 million views all over the internet, and 3000 people showed up for our last fight. So if you want to see the robot in action on how it's getting trained and how people are using it to do sports and entertainment kind of stuff, do

S Speaker 12:06absolutely. And I was just just wanted to say, I mean, we are excited about the space quite a lot. We are spending time. It feels like Qualcomm silicon would power a lot of humanoid companies going forward. And we recently invested in Figure AI as well. So we're very actively looking at the space. So keep us posted on things, how things evolve. And in case, if you see any specific investors in my network that you'd like to get connected to, or anyone in the network itself happy to make those intros, absolutely.

S Speaker 22:36And you said, like call from chips want to power the Human Rights right? Yeah. So we AWS is actually sponsoring one of our fights to power on robots with their chips. So if you want to sponsor any of those fights in some some sort of way, it will be like a huge broadcast across the world. Like it's like, yeah, people know about pop culture and how it functions on a robot real time. Yeah. So if you want to approach in that
