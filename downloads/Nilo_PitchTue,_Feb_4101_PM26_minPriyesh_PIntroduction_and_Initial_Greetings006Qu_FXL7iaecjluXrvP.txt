S Speaker 24:21amazing and great background. Thank you. Do you mind if I ask a few questions before diving deeper into new Absolutely, yes, yeah. So you mentioned that it's mostly series A especially with a ticket size, it makes sense. But also you mentioned that you would be investing now in seed, especially in AI, which also makes sense. But then, would the ticket sizes still be the same, or you would you bring it down?

S Speaker 14:43So I would say we wouldn't do anything less than a $1 million check typically, because inside, we have to go through entire compliance, legal and stuff like that. So like, we have to get a lot of wheels moving in the corporate as well. So I think check size lesser than a million dollar wouldn't really move the needle. That

S Speaker 25:06makes a lot of sense. Yeah. And in terms of the funds page, and I ask, because creating this kind of creation tool, you know, I've been in this space for a very long time. Like Roblox is 20 years old. It is 25 years old. Unreal Engine. 35 years old is going to take a while. And I'm not saying with AI, it can be accelerated, but it's going to take a while. So I'm looking for partners that are with the on the journey for the long run, and someone that goes like, I need to return this in two years. Sometimes doesn't make sense. I just want to ask that question? Absolutely,

S Speaker 15:40that's a very fair question. So for us, it works out because we are an evergreen fund. We don't have a timeline on the fund, so we don't have to return it back to Qualcomm. So we, from that perspective, exit wouldn't be a concern for us at all.

S Speaker 25:54Yeah, cool. But I was wondering what other kinds of investments you've made in terms of deep Tech game simulation, Tech game engine, that kind of sense. So
Yeah, cool. But I was wondering what other kinds of investments you've made in terms of deep Tech game simulation, Tech game engine, that kind of sense. So
Yeah, cool. But I was wondering what other kinds of investments you've made in terms of deep Tech game simulation, Tech game engine, that kind of sense. So
Yeah, cool. But I was wondering what other kinds of investments you've made in terms of deep Tech game simulation, Tech game engine, that kind of sense. So
S Speaker 16:06we have a partner very dedicated to the gaming ecosystem, and I guess down the line, I would love to connect you to them as well. Rich, he has made a lot of investments in gaming ecosystem. Let me see if I can find a few of them. But especially in AR VR, given that Qualcomm supplies most of the chips, probably 90% of the entire AR VR devices are powered by Qualcomm chips. So we have had a few investments in that space. So Vios is one name which comes to my mind, and then I'm sure I can find a few more and send it to your way, but I'm just not getting the names right out of my head. Yeah,

S Speaker 26:42absolutely. I asked specifically about that because I know that you're very big in AI and VR, so I was wondering about the other side

6:49as well. Yeah, absolutely, yes.
as well. Yeah, absolutely, yes.

as well. Yeah, absolutely, yes.
S Speaker 26:53Maybe it's worth me giving a little bit of background in true and myself and Nilo. I know that at the devil day, I didn't do a good job explaining the vision, because it was more about the demo, and without context, it doesn't make that much sense why I'm building this, or why we got in 360s in the first place. So maybe it's worth so for me, I've always been in the games industry. I wanted to be a game developer since I was 12, I was playing Final Fantasy seven, and I was like, oh, what this game is making me feel right now is what I would like to make other people feel as well. And from then, I was set for life. I taught myself programming, games programming. I went to so I did Computer Science and Engineering in Lisbon, which is where I'm from. And then I went to the UK to do a master's in games programming, which allowed me to then get into the industry. So I went to Germany to work at Piranha Bytes and again, called Reason three, because I had played a game that that company had made years ago when I was a kid called Gothic, and that was the best introduction to the industry I could have gotten, because that's when I was responsible to actually ship a console title. And that's when I started my journey working in custom game engines and creation tools. So was working on AI graphics. I was working on animation, working on optimization of the engine. So very much in the nitty gritty for four years, and then I wanted to see how a game production that is big in scale actually operates. So I went back to the UK. I joined Microsoft. We're working on Fable Legends, because I had played fable when I was a kid. And Fable Legends one of these really big, dozens of millions of dollars production, and now I was able to see how a big company now operates and creates games at that level. So give me a different perspective of smaller company, bigger company, and then I joined a startup, polystream, which was I was the first engineer hired at polystream, which does cloud gaming, but without using video. So virtualizing the graphics card of the games of the cloud, compressing the commands and then sending the streamed commands to the clients to play them back on the client, which is very interesting. And Intel gave us a 12 million Series A round. That's what we raised from them. And so it was a Silicon Valley story, but in the UK, you know, where company grew to 50 people, got that seed series A eventually, the company was acquired by mythical games. But I mentioned this because that was the first time that I had the entrepreneurship bug. That's when I saw, Oh, if I would like to do something like this in the future, then I can't just be focused on engineering. And this is how you fundraise. This is how you do marketing and sales. And so my journey towards preparing to have Nilo today actually started back then, almost 10 years ago. And the CEO Bruce Grove, who was engineering manager at Sun Microsystems and many other companies. He is today an advisor in the alone. So very good friend. And after that, I joined epic, and I was in the console team for Unreal, engine five and Fortnite. And one of the things that people are not very aware of at Epic is that actually the console team is just six people. It's like one person for Sony, one person for Nintendo, one person for Microsoft, for Xbox, you know? So that team is extremely small, yeah, but it's filled with some of the best people in the industry. And again, that was a great learning experience for me, to be able to see how a scale up does things, and how you operate at hundreds of millions of users, and how you actually do that in the first place. So I joined before Unreal Engine five was released. Once it was released, I moved and created the optimization team for Unreal Engine five. And again, that was an amazing opportunity and great experience, which sets me up to today, where I've had more than 15 years seeing all of these different perspectives in the games industry, always working with creation tools. And the problem is that all of them are frustrating to use. It's really, really hard to actually get anything done. And just a small example. If I want to see a small change in Fortnite, I need to wait 15 minutes on one platform, and the thing runs on eight platforms, and every time I want to see a change, it takes me a long time to use. I spent so many years learning these tools, and even today, they are hard to use. Like, I can't create content. Creating code is hard. Putting the things together I need to go and search for documentation. Like, if it's hard even for me, how are common people going to use these tools? And that's why I created new like, I want something that is joyful for me, but I also want to give that same joy of creation, ability and creativity to young people, to 13 year olds that today are playing Roblox Minecraft fortnight every day. They're pretty native. They understand 3d space, but once they start to get at an age where they want to create and customize their experience, where do they need to go? Blender, Unreal Engine. But how? How are they going to go from the other so the idea is to create something, and why? Now, this is a good point, because I could have created this before, but I never did, because there was no compelling why. Now, now we have the browser, WebAssembly, web GPU. Big companies are actually making it a powerful platform where you can create a game within two to five factor of experiences that are very compelling on desktop, whereas before, you had two orders of magnitude where you couldn't create any compelling experience because the browser was not good. Today it is which enables the best distribution model of all, which is just sharing a link. So Neil already runs on the phone, as you've seen, it runs inside. Telegram, runs on Discord, runs on desktop. All the users can be connected across multiple different platforms because it runs on the browser. But more importantly, today, we have generative AI. Just a couple of years ago, you could not have created a model out of nothing. And today I can see that every three months, the model quality continues to improve. So what I can do is to give that ability to users to say you don't know what, to create art, and it will take hours for you to do that. But it doesn't matter. You can create art. You can create code. I can create a package for them to be able to, even without skills, be able to learn and express their creativity together, right? And that's why I created nulu in the first place, to enable that. And of course, then we go into the big vision of where I want to get this. But I'm going to pause there and let you ask any question that's
Maybe it's worth me giving a little bit of background in true and myself and Nilo. I know that at the devil day, I didn't do a good job explaining the vision, because it was more about the demo, and without context, it doesn't make that much sense why I'm building this, or why we got in 360s in the first place.

And that's why I created new like, I want something that is joyful for me, but I also want to give that same joy of creation, ability and creativity to young people, to 13 year olds that today are playing Roblox Minecraft fortnight every day. They're pretty native. They understand 3d space, but once they start to get at an age where they want to create and customize their experience, where do they need to go? Blender, Unreal Engine. But how? How are they going to go from the other so the idea is to create something, and why? Now, this is a good point, because I could have created this before, but I never did, because there was no compelling why. Now, now we have the browser, WebAssembly, web GPU. Big companies are actually making it a powerful platform where you can create a game within two to five factor of experiences that are very compelling on desktop, whereas before, you had two orders of magnitude where you couldn't create any compelling experience because the browser was not good. Today it is which enables the best distribution model of all, which is just sharing a link. So Neil already runs on the phone, as you've seen, it runs inside. Telegram, runs on Discord, runs on desktop. All the users can be connected across multiple different platforms because it runs on the browser. But more importantly, today, we have generative AI. Just a couple of years ago, you could not have created a model out of nothing. And today I can see that every three months, the model quality continues to improve. So what I can do is to give that ability to users to say you don't know what, to create art, and it will take hours for you to do that. But it doesn't matter. You can create art. You can create code. I can create a package for them to be able to, even without skills, be able to learn and express their creativity together, right? And that's why I created nulu in the first place, to enable that. And of course, then we go into the big vision of where I want to get this. But I'm going to pause there and let you ask any question that's
Maybe it's worth me giving a little bit of background in true and myself and Nilo. I know that at the devil day, I didn't do a good job explaining the vision, because it was more about the demo, and without context, it doesn't make that much sense why I'm building this, or why we got in 360s in the first place. So maybe it's worth so for me, I've always been in the games industry. I wanted to be a game developer since I was 12, I was playing Final Fantasy seven, and I was like, oh, what this game is making me feel right now is what I would like to make other people feel as well. And from then, I was set for life. I taught myself programming, games programming. I went to so I did Computer Science and Engineering in Lisbon, which is where I'm from. And then I went to the UK to do a master's in games programming, which allowed me to then get into the industry. So I went to Germany to work at Piranha Bytes and again, called Reason three, because I had played a game that that company had made years ago when I was a kid called Gothic, and that was the best introduction to the industry I could have gotten, because that's when I was responsible to actually ship a console title. And that's when I started my journey working in custom game engines and creation tools. So was working on AI graphics. I was working on animation, working on optimization of the engine. So very much in the nitty gritty for four years, and then I wanted to see how a game production that is big in scale actually operates. So I went back to the UK. I joined Microsoft. We're working on Fable Legends, because I had played fable when I was a kid. And Fable Legends one of these really big, dozens of millions of dollars production, and now I was able to see how a big company now operates and creates games at that level. So give me a different perspective of smaller company, bigger company, and then I joined a startup, polystream, which was I was the first engineer hired at polystream, which does cloud gaming, but without using video. So virtualizing the graphics card of the games of the cloud, compressing the commands and then sending the streamed commands to the clients to play them back on the client, which is very interesting. And Intel gave us a 12 million Series A round. That's what we raised from them. And so it was a Silicon Valley story, but in the UK, you know, where company grew to 50 people, got that seed series A eventually, the company was acquired by mythical games. But I mentioned this because that was the first time that I had the entrepreneurship bug. That's when I saw, Oh, if I would like to do something like this in the future, then I can't just be focused on engineering. And this is how you fundraise. This is how you do marketing and sales. And so my journey towards preparing to have Nilo today actually started back then, almost 10 years ago. And the CEO Bruce Grove, who was engineering manager at Sun Microsystems and many other companies. He is today an advisor in the alone. So very good friend. And after that, I joined epic, and I was in the console team for Unreal, engine five and Fortnite. And one of the things that people are not very aware of at Epic is that actually the console team is just six people. It's like one person for Sony, one person for Nintendo, one person for Microsoft, for Xbox, you know? So that team is extremely small, yeah, but it's filled with some of the best people in the industry. And again, that was a great learning experience for me, to be able to see how a scale up does things, and how you operate at hundreds of millions of users, and how you actually do that in the first place. So I joined before Unreal Engine five was released. Once it was released, I moved and created the optimization team for Unreal Engine five. And again, that was an amazing opportunity and great experience, which sets me up to today, where I've had more than 15 years seeing all of these different perspectives in the games industry, always working with creation tools. And the problem is that all of them are frustrating to use. It's really, really hard to actually get anything done. And just a small example. If I want to see a small change in Fortnite, I need to wait 15 minutes on one platform, and the thing runs on eight platforms, and every time I want to see a change, it takes me a long time to use. I spent so many years learning these tools, and even today, they are hard to use. Like, I can't create content. Creating code is hard. Putting the things together I need to go and search for documentation. Like, if it's hard even for me, how are common people going to use these tools? And that's why I created new like, I want something that is joyful for me, but I also want to give that same joy of creation, ability and creativity to young people, to 13 year olds that today are playing Roblox Minecraft fortnight every day.

And of course, then we go into the big vision of where I want to get this. But I'm going to pause there and let you ask any question that's
S Speaker 214:33so the games industry has been growing at 10 to 13% compound annual revenue growth for a very long time, until a couple of years ago, that's actually growing at either not growing or growing at 1% the only part of the market that is currently growing is user generated content. So Roblox Minecraft, right? And so Roblox has 400 million monthly active users, 58% of which are kids. So you have more than 200 million users, and now what you're asking about, okay, what's the monetization? Right? Actually, Roblox monetizes very little compared to any other platform, even though it has more use, like Roblox is bigger than all game consoles combined, and it monetizes less than them, because, why? Because kids are not paying right? Yeah. And so where is needle difference? The difference is that as I speak with parents, and as I do user interviews with with children and their parents, what the feedback that I'm getting is that kids would not have dedicated Roblox and Minecraft time because it's a game, right? But what I'm hearing is that because there's a code editor, because it's creativity time, they would get dedicated Nilo time, parents would actually pay for a subscription, because it's a learning tool, right? And so this is where we start to get into a very interesting dynamic where it's fun for kids to use, and parents would pay for it. So that's where I see the opportunity, and that's where I see the market being big. Is that,
so the games industry has been growing at 10 to 13% compound annual revenue growth for a very long time, until a couple of years ago, that's actually growing at either not growing or growing at 1% the only part of the market that is currently growing is user generated content.

So that's where I see the opportunity, and that's where I see the market being big. Is that,
S Speaker 116:09like a hypothesis today, Nuno that parents will be paying for this? Or do you have some indications from the market that this is, and I'm assuming this would be, then, a prosumer app, native across multiple devices. Do you have an indication that parents would pay, or do you have a willingness to pay? Sort of figure somewhere in your mind?

S Speaker 216:31So I had two parents that already said that they would pay if I had any kind of payment, but that's, you know, I only wrote the first line for Nilo for that six months ago. So this is something that we're going to go out and prove that it's actually possible and feasible. So we've used this time to create the product, create the prototype, and it's going to continue to improve, and eventually we're going to find out that, hey, the market is also there, but that's the journey. That's what we're raising now, to get there,

That's what we're raising now, to get there,
S Speaker 117:04absolutely, I get that. So on the product side, again, let's, let's two spaces that I'd like to dig deeper. One is your go to market. How are you planning to sell it? How are you planning to sort of acquire a lot of target audience here, in case, in this case, children and to on the product side. I saw the demo, and I understand how you create games, but how do you sort of go from a physics enabled 3d model to an entire game on the platform?
absolutely, I get that. So on the product side, again, let's, let's two spaces that I'd like to dig deeper. One is your go to market. How are you planning to sell it?

S Speaker 120:07That's amazing, Nunu, and that makes a lot of sense. And with the positioning now and the target audience and the vision you have in my night, it also makes it very clear that the product is very differentiated from all the other prom to 3d game generation assets companies. So that makes a lot of sense. Where are you today? What milestones do you plan to hit over the year? And when? When does a fundraising round come in? Things like that? How are you looking at 2025?
That's amazing, Nunu, and that makes a lot of sense.

S Speaker 122:21Yeah, that makes sense. And you mentioned you plan to prove some early traction this month, sometime before, what's your sort of target threshold that you want to read before you sort of start the fundraising round?
Yeah, that makes sense. And you mentioned you plan to prove some early traction this month, sometime before, what's your sort of target threshold that you want to read before you sort of start the fundraising round?

S Speaker 123:32Absolutely no. That makes a lot of sense. It's very exciting, for sure. I would like to go back do a little bit more research on the market and the space, I particularly am not as familiar with that so, but it's very interesting, for sure, you early on, you mentioned that it would take some time for it to scale and prove traction. I know it's too early, so for me to sort of ask that question, but typically in your mind, what sort of metrics do you see from a year from now, a couple of years from now?
Absolutely no. That makes a lot of sense. It's very exciting, for sure. I would like to go back do a little bit more research on the market and the space, I particularly am not as familiar with that so, but it's very interesting, for sure, you early on, you mentioned that it would take some time for it to scale and prove traction.

S Speaker 224:07I don't know, to be honest, I'm just pulling like numbers out of thin air, but that's going to depends on how much interest there will be once people actually see it from the user interviews I've done one by one, and I am not saying, Hey, here's the discord link. Just join now. I'm going like, you are a good person to join the discord link. It's like a curated community. I don't care about, oh, we have 10,000 people from the user. Interviews I've done where children have played with their parents, even behind them and everything. The feedback has been very positive, and I'm recording all of this interviews, right? And the feedback from both parents and kids is that this is something that they haven't seen before, that they would actually enjoy doing now, if I put this in front of more people, would they actually be interested? And in how many numbers like, I don't know. I would just be pulling numbers out of my asset. I don't want to do that. And that
