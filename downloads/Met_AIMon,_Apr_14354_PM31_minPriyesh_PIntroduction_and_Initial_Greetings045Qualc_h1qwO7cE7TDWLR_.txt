S Speaker 21:24to the United States. Yeah. I think me and myself, and also the CEO, Daniel, both of us will be there, and also our business development team. Yeah. So if I remember correctly, I think I met Daniel during the NVIDIA GDC event, and then particularly excited here, Dave is work physically high, broadly speaking, is a very exciting space for Qualcomm what we'll feel down the line when human rights or a lot of other robotic infrastructure gets adopted on a mass scale, we feel a lot of compute for some of these robots would be done on Qualcomm chips. We feel Qualcomm chips are best positioned to give you performance per watt, and we pride ourselves in that particular metric. And we feel a lot of these robots will use our chipsets. Our chipset. And hence we want to be very strategic about the space down the line. We feel there'll be a lot of partnership opportunities with companies building in the space. And then had a great conversation with Daniel. Would love to understand a little bit more about what you guys are building, and then see down the line if you have any partnership opportunities. I believe Dave you, you raised around already earlier this year, so I'm assuming there is not an opportunity to be fundraising anytime soon. Actually, we we will have this year, and we'll test market if everything goes smoothly. I think we're strongly considered to raise another round in the end of this year. So I think there's some possibility that that we might need to raise in order to, like, push the speed of our business fastest. Well, that is, that's great. I

S Speaker 12:38think that's, that's great. We can start the conversation today, down the line, when there's an opportunity. Okay, opportunity, just would be happy to evaluate that as well, and then, particularly when to create a thesis on physical AI, talking to a bunch of robot foundational companies, digital twin companies, synthetic data creation companies, and putting together my notes. So we'd love to sort of have an understanding on what met AI is doing, and then we take it from

S Speaker 112:51Dave. That was a very comprehensive overview. And I really enjoyed the venture capital perspective of why you invested, why you joined the company as well. And so for sharing that, so a couple of, couple of, couple of follow up questions. There are several companies today in the market which can create, which use generating, create a 3d model from a 2d model or a picture or an image. I understand you have a semiconductor partnership with Ken mech. Sorry, I'm missing the name you mentioned, but this moment, right? But how does your technology, how is it significantly better than other 2d to 3d model companies out there,

S Speaker 115:16That's that's very interesting. I mean, yes, that makes a lot of sense. A lot of companies that we have come across with 3d models, they are focused more on how the model would look like, and not as much on how the model would behave. And is it that? And that makes sense, because a lot of use cases that they targeting are also in advertisement game generations. So in for some of those industries, that might work, but for the more, I would say, sensitive industries that you are waiting for, you need a lot

S Speaker 215:40of, you can say the vertical AI. So to serve you, if you don't understand extremely this equipment operate, how can you let the AI to learn from this equipment, right? So there's no way you can do the physical AI understanding each of the equipment, how it works, agreed.

S Speaker 115:54Yeah, that makes sense. So, Dave, you also mentioned on the platform, you currently have a model built for a lot of equipments and a lot of piping systems that you had to go on and build some of these one by one. To include how some of these equipments work. Do you think that's that could stop you from scaling significantly? Do you think you will be able to handle all sorts of equipments without a direct partnership with them? How are you thinking about that
Yeah, that makes sense.

S Speaker 118:36makes a lot of sense, and that's interesting way to put it. Dave So Einstein, there's a foundation business model. On top of that, you have vertical focused AI agents. Let's call it that. Imagine from it is like maybe drawing a parallel to the traditional LLM industry. You have a foundation model, or an infrastructure to train a foundation model at there, and then you have pre fine tuned foundation models for very specific vertical applications about it. And how do you decide which of these AI agents do you plan to build? First, okay?

S Speaker 121:52That's very interesting. David, that's crazy. I think you probably did you beat the salt. That could be like one of the companies. But that's, that's crazy. That's, that's amazing. So is the plan to be, say, infrastructure layer company throughout. Or do you also see yourself sort of creating very small foundation models that you can plug and play into some of these smart robots and get them enabled immediately?

S Speaker 123:05But I believe in this entire process being the infrastructure player, you're also collecting some very valuable data that would be very exclusive to you, and you can use that to bring foundation models, something like the world labs of the world, but way more deeply, more verticalized. Do you? Do you have plans for that? Do you thinking about that currently, or maybe in the future, actually,

S Speaker 223:26exhibition, we will have a demo video and create by our generating model. So we have a close relationship with Nvidia. Every week, we'll have some discussion, because we must invest by their corporate ventures. So we care about our development of our product business. So you mentioned that each of the video that we create can provide a material for this vertical, AI to trend and learn, so that right now, we are not targeting to provide a lot of existing data for you to trade. We just provide a tool for you to build yourself. So that will be more easier, but that's a different kind of business model. But we don't want to. We don't. We don't. There's a company called Sky engine. You can, you can go strong England, but their valuation the market is quite small, because they are building Cosmos material for synthetic data, so into the project based company. So they are solving problems, providing those in the data, one by one each industry. But we want to do that non scalable business model. So we believe that providing this infrastructure is more scalable to offer you the tool, but the tool is easy and even for you to understand, even though you don't have any experience in omnibus,

24:22that makes a lot of sense. They so fast

S Speaker 124:26manufacturing of your G teams currently. Can you give me a sense of how big that market itself is, and in that market, how? What's attraction like today? Yeah,
manufacturing of your G teams currently. Can you give me a sense of how big that market itself is, and in that market, how? What's attraction like today? Yeah,
manufacturing of your G teams currently. Can you give me a sense of how big that market itself is, and in that market, how? What's attraction like today? Yeah,
manufacturing of your G teams currently. Can you give me a sense of how big that market itself is, and in that market, how? What's attraction like today? Yeah,
S Speaker 224:38right now. I was first inserted the strategy. Right now. We collaborate with each joint of semiconductor effect. They paid us more than for three to four minutes US dollar just by building this platform. But this is this is also can be skilled, because we won't discover parameter. We don't know about parameter. We just build this platform. But the good thing is that we want to build this platform at the same time. They also need us to build this platform. So they pay for to build this platform. That's good, yeah, and every have to pay out, pay us millions of the reoccurring maintenance fee to use our platform. This is the first, this is one of the corporation. So you can imagine every, every customer getting into this piping system. Maybe needs some customization. So we will trust the millions dollar to build this like customization for you a little bit, just a little minute power. So imagine, right now this NRE it just took like, six, six months and less than 10 people, and we do this product. So you can think about, we have more agent, and just each agent just need a very minor after people, and very minor of the time. So, so, so this business model is that we charge million, and every which is a lot of million, we go to market by like micro and texture instrument and the gold market strategy is that we collaborate with, like, essentially this kind of SI system integrator in both in Taiwan, and introduce us together to go to this kind of market. So I think if you are Imagine the time about about this is that every year they are wasting a billion dollars about rearrangement, about this layout, but the year they delay of this fabulous year, of the loss of the revenue that they can create originally. So this market, I believe, is quite huge, but you can say that there's not a lot of people are building this kind of the fact, right? There's a limit number, but at the same time, this can become semi subconductor. Fab already have another five topic, five different kind of age, and they want to collaborate with us, looking measure the production line, Agent equipment, AI, agent, so the more, the more people can serve, because it's an infrastructure. So it's really hard to tell about the 10. But right now, recently, we are doing research about the 10, because the next round we might do another fundraising might be important to let the investor knows. But right now, I think the problem behind is not the 10. Is the problem behind is that there's no player that is complete with us. Yeah. So every step we move is the whole new step. And then sometimes we're adding a media about the step we already reached into energy that they know, oh, the problem that we can solve. So the problem behind is that, when I met this company, the problem because is that this people don't understand the value, but enterprise don't have a budget to do this kind of building in physical AI. So right now we are step by step to create a value, to network, to know, and then we get just a point to connect the market, first about the importance of physical AI, digital twin, practice and data. So we are the we are the one to make it happen. So from the investor perspective, I don't really pay a lot attention on the team, but mostly to let the work that enterprise understand the value behind so you're willing to adopt it. That makes
right now. I was first inserted the strategy. Right now. We collaborate with each joint of semiconductor effect. They paid us more than for three to four minutes US dollar just by building this platform. But this is this is also can be skilled, because we won't discover parameter. We don't know about parameter. We just build this platform. But the good thing is that we want to build this platform at the same time. They also need us to build this platform. So they pay for to build this platform. That's good, yeah, and every have to pay out, pay us millions of the reoccurring maintenance fee to use our platform. This is the first, this is one of the corporation. So you can imagine every, every customer getting into this piping system. Maybe needs some customization. So we will trust the millions dollar to build this like customization for you a little bit, just a little minute power. So imagine, right now this NRE it just took like, six, six months and less than 10 people, and we do this product. So you can think about, we have more agent, and just each agent just need a very minor after people, and very minor of the time. So, so, so this business model is that we charge million, and every which is a lot of million, we go to market by like micro and texture instrument and the gold market strategy is that we collaborate with, like, essentially this kind of SI system integrator in both in Taiwan, and introduce us together to go to this kind of market. So I think if you are Imagine the time about about this is that every year they are wasting a billion dollars about rearrangement, about this layout, but the year they delay of this fabulous year, of the loss of the revenue that they can create originally. So this market, I believe, is quite huge, but you can say that there's not a lot of people are building this kind of the fact, right? There's a limit number, but at the same time, this can become semi subconductor. Fab already have another five topic, five different kind of age, and they want to collaborate with us, looking measure the production line, Agent equipment, AI, agent, so the more, the more people can serve, because it's an infrastructure. So it's really hard to tell about the 10. But right now, recently, we are doing research about the 10, because the next round we might do another fundraising might be important to let the investor knows. But right now, I think the problem behind is not the 10. Is the problem behind is that there's no player that is complete with us. Yeah. So every step we move is the whole new step. And then sometimes we're adding a media about the step we already reached into energy that they know, oh, the problem that we can solve. So the problem behind is that, when I met this company, the problem because is that this people don't understand the value, but enterprise don't have a budget to do this kind of building in physical AI.

S Speaker 128:05We are more financial investing. I would say we invest in areas which are strategic to Qualcomm. So anything around compute connectivity, robotics, IoT, computer vision, industrial automation, are areas where Qualcomm is interested. But in those areas we make a very financial bet. So we have to follow financial discipline. We have to make sure we return money back to the fund. So we do all that, but then we invest only in areas which are strategy, and at the same time, we for any company we part we invest in, we make sure we partner with them through our business units, do any engineering collaboration, try to see if Qualcomm and can act as a customer for the company, or if we can introduce the investment into a lot of other partners. Because we talk to almost all of the automotive OEMs, almost all of the mobile OEMs. So those are very close partners. We try to take our portfolio and see if we can get them in duty team. So we do a lot of that as

So we do a lot of that as
S Speaker 129:44they are research on a lot of physical aid companies. I think probably in the next three to four weeks, we will come to a conclusion on how the market looks like. What are the players in the market? And potentially at that point, I would love to reconnect with you, have few more of my team members join in and have a wider discussion, maybe, maybe during that process, I would love to come back with a few more questions on my end. Questions on my end, so that will be great. And then I know as a few digital twin companies, because they may have a need for it. So let me work internally with the business unit and see if we can possibly also suggest you as a vendor, and see if that can be a commercial partnership. We can start
