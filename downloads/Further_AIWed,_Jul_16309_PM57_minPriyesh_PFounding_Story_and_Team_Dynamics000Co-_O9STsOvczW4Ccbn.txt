S Speaker 10:36it won't work. That happened in my first company, like a great team of engineers and sales people, it is still at couple of minutes in revenue four and a half years. Like, what took me about four years to get to we did it in six months at further. Ai, okay? Like, that's the difference with the market is pushing you and the pain is happening, right? So, but yeah, we do have a like two coffee sirs, two co founders, seshank, who is the CTO. We studied together at IIT Bombay, Vijay also. But antibombi had these two kinds of people in it. And every batch you would have people like Seshan ban. Vijay is actually smart, like insane Genesis. I'm not that kind, the other kind who's like, slog their ass off, like work till maybe 14 hours a day during J time.

S Speaker 21:37top 100 ranks, yeah, in JEE are those type of people who don't have this long at all. Mine
top 100 ranks, yeah, in JEE are those type of people who don't have this long at all. Mine

top 100 ranks, yeah, in JEE are those type of people who don't have this long at all. Mine
S Speaker 11:43was 52 what je rank 52 Yeah, just
was 52 what je rank 52 Yeah, just
was 52 what je rank 52 Yeah, just
was 52 what je rank 52 Yeah, just
1:52being modest. Then
S Speaker 21:56most of the JE rank top 100 that I've seen. They're just, they don't have to work as hard at all. No.
most of the JE rank top 100 that I've seen. They're just, they don't have to work as hard at all. No.

most of the JE rank top 100 that I've seen. They're just, they don't have to work as hard at all. No.
S Speaker 12:04So interestingly, like, because I was in the batch of, like, all je rank 100 joined CS in it, yeah. So I was in that group, and I saw that these two groups of people very clearly, where few were, like, insane geniuses like Sushant, who have a friend who was ranked for his name is Nishant. I think he's at MIT right now, PhD. After three years down, he could do math by 137 multiplied by 165 and give you the answer. And I was like, looking at a calculator. Yeah, you're right. So that's one kind of, I hear you, but okay, these are people who

S Speaker 12:47Yeah, exactly. So is an interesting reality check. That's where I'm like, Cool. I want to stick to my guns. Work 12 hours a day. That's the only way I would sort of finish towards the top of the class and so on. But that's like the two guys. And at further AI, I wanted to partner with somebody who I feel is really smart, because then I would respect them and who would respect my background, because, like, I'd built a company before, and so on. So who would know that? Okay, I know how to build a company. Want to do it again, much, maybe with a chip on my shoulder this time around, but the first one was not super successful, yeah, so that's like the founding story, I
Yeah, exactly. So is an interesting reality check. That's where I'm like, Cool. I want to stick to my guns. Work 12 hours a day.

S Speaker 13:32batch 2012, to 16. Got it got it funny. Turn off events. I met my wife at his wedding. So his like, my wife is friends with shank. She also went to IIT Bombay. I knew her, but she didn't know me. Again, the ratio of the batches are so, but I met her at the shanks wedding. So sort of, are you all what? CS, yeah, no, so Shashank and I'm in. CS, my wife was in here. Like, so she's a co founder. So, yeah. Like, it's sort of interesting. So I keep telling us, telling my seed round, that one of the reasons that companies fail, 65% of companies fail because of co founder conflict. Yes, we have avoided that thing altogether, because both of us would get a whooping at our houses if we don't work well together, or if there's any conflict, like, our parents know each other. They hang out together back in India. So in that way, that thing has okay, like, we picked the right team. We are a very good team. Like, I'm all about aggression. Let's go fast and so on. So shank is a very steady force. Okay?

S Speaker 24:40So it's the two of you, just two of us, and then two of you are co founders, and then you have, how big is the rest of the team? 12
So it's the two of you, just two of us, and then two of you are co founders, and then you have, how big is the rest of the team? 12

S Speaker 14:57and it's working out pretty well, like I think we are right now limited by the people we have, in some ways, to take care of the demand, because, like I'm doing, I did 60 meetings on an average in the last eight weeks. So it's becoming, like very difficult. So need to sort of balance it out a little today, because it's my if I count, and not to brag about it, because that means I'm not planning well. I need to sort of plan better. This is my ones, 234-567-8910, 11, 12/13,

so most of those were half an hour meetings.
S Speaker 15:41They were few which were one hour one and so I mean, but that's not to brag, because that's like, I need to find more people who can do few of these things. Some of them were first time customer conversations. Some of them are account management conversations and so on. Some of them are relevant, like that. I need to talk to the stakeholders for, let's say, doing a press release with for the AI and so on and so forth. But some of them could be handled by a junior perspective. We are building that capability right now. I spoke to one of our angel investors, and he saw our deck and so on. He saw that, guys, your biggest risk right now is that you don't have account management team, because you have been able to close these accounts, these big accounts.

But do you have one or two people right now,
But do you have one or two people right now,
But do you have one or two people right now,
S Speaker 16:31me and Shashank are doing the account management. So we built, firstly, the engineering core, yeah, okay. We need to build something when customers come. Then we built a sales top of the funnel, like I was doing the outreach, and then we had one more person for outreach, so that once we have the top of the funnel, we can choose to select between customers and so forth. Then we built the middle of the funnel. I was doing the demos. Now I don't need to do the demo and so on. Then still closing is by me yet about a million. So I've wanted to do till a million closing personally, so that I can build that playbook and optimize every part of the equation Correct. After that, I wanted to have an account management team. Till then, I wanted me and Shashank to run that account management so that we are taking there's no second hand feedback firsthand customer feedback, and so on. And it also exposes him to engine like sales sort of things, account management. And he gets to learn with the nu, and he's very he can be a salesperson as well. Okay.

7:38Yeah, right time to actually go higher.
Yeah, right time to actually go higher.
Yeah, right time to actually go higher.
Yeah, right time to actually go higher.
7:40Yeah, now it feels like
Yeah, now it feels like
Yeah, now it feels like
Yeah, now it feels like
S Speaker 27:42the sales, first sales, hire, true sales. So sales we have now, or maybe
the sales, first sales, hire, true sales. So sales we have now, or maybe
the sales, first sales, hire, true sales. So sales we have now, or maybe
the sales, first sales, hire, true sales. So sales we have now, or maybe
S Speaker 17:47account management, yeah, that we don't have, like, customer success, yeah. So I was thinking like just one person can do both account management and customers. It's hard to find. I was earlier thinking find a person who can do engineering. You
account management, yeah, that we don't have, like, customer success, yeah. So I was thinking like just one person can do both account management and customers. It's hard to find. I was earlier thinking find a person who can do engineering. You

account management, yeah, that we don't have, like, customer success, yeah. So I was thinking like just one person can do both account management and customers. It's hard to find. I was earlier thinking find a person who can do engineering. You
S Speaker 28:02get your sales person to do account management, and then you get your customer success person to engineering, plus customer deployed, right? Yeah, yeah.
get your sales person to do account management, and then you get your customer success person to engineering, plus customer deployed, right? Yeah, yeah.
get your sales person to do account management, and then you get your customer success person to engineering, plus customer deployed, right? Yeah, yeah.
get your sales person to do account management, and then you get your customer success person to engineering, plus customer deployed, right? Yeah, yeah.
S Speaker 18:11So not being able to close that role, it's been insanely hard to find a forward deployed engineer in the Bay Area, because every other company is going for that role? Firstly, engineers. Very few engineers could be forward deployed, correct? Because that's like, you have to be good at code, but also good at talking to people, which is a rare skill,
So not being able to close that role, it's been insanely hard to find a forward deployed engineer in the Bay Area, because every other company is going for that role? Firstly, engineers.

S Speaker 210:09So those are the types of requirements that they have, versus some of the others. Like, what I would recommend is you can look at for these roles, GitHub, GitLab has been able to hire over deployment engineers a lot, so I know that some, like baits and biases had hired people from there, and then they had some because I had gotten them a contract with Qualcomm so our guys had appreciated customer success. People a lot.
So those are the types of requirements that they have, versus some of the others.

10:48Okay, interesting.
S Speaker 210:51But that role, those roles are like, make or break, like they can have a major impact, like one of my portfolio companies. They found out that some of the larger accounts started churning, revenue churn, and then they figured out, okay, what's going on here? And turns out that that customer success person was dropping 12. And turned out that was just yeah, that account, some other accounts had same, same issues. So so that role in general, in that role, you have to be ruthless, as in, hire fast fire, fast you as an early stage startup you cannot afford, like it's so that role is very you need to have, like, a very active pipeline of people
But that role, those roles are like, make or break, like they can have a major impact, like one of my portfolio companies.

So that's, that's direct so, so that's, but it's okay with us, because it's still because that aipc Business is a growth business, and it's a relatively new business for us, right? So over there, we want to work with more ecosystem partners and enable them on our platforms. It's
with an LLM company, that makes it more so.

S Speaker 218:51Oh, the aipcs? Yeah. I mean, we had, like, for example, last year was the first time when we had, like, a custom CPU, like, think of like apples M processor. So now, I mean, everybody, Microsoft Surface has AI, PCs, Dell, HP, Lenovo, everybody has them. And then so, and they're doing well. So the we think that the future of PCS is on. We don't think the future of PCS is going to be x86 because Apple's already have to run, and it's much better power performance.
Oh, the aipcs? Yeah. I mean, we had, like, for example, last year was the first time when we had, like, a custom CPU, like, think of like apples M processor.

So over there, yeah, so we, I mean,
S Speaker 219:45there's, it's doing really well. But essentially, the way that market works is you, you need to incentivize the channel a lot. So we are incentivizing the channel heavily. And then we, you don't necessarily just rely on the channel. You will go build your own channel, which is you go sell to the end customer. Like for businesses, for the consumers, we leave it to, let's say, the best buys of the world, but to businesses, we go sell them. For enterprises ourselves. So we've got, like, a large enterprise channel team. That's great.

S Speaker 120:23It's fascinating, because I can see the world where, especially in industries like insurance, which are like super data sensitive, like the PCs themselves, will have some of the AI tools like further AI hosted and pre packaged and so on.

S Speaker 220:41Typically, what you do is like, so pre packaging used to work. The world of pre, pre loads has gone away. Interesting. But what works is you go to, let's say, an insurance company, and you sell them that, hey, by the way, this company further, AI, can run everything on device, okay, nothing leaves, I mean this device in terms of processing. And then they say, oh, that's essentially for a lot of them these days, actually, for several use cases. People are like, Okay, we want that for sure, yeah. And then they say, Okay, go cut a deal with we don't even take any like, there's no archition as such, yeah, there's no cut. So then we say, Okay, go work with further AI we've already validated. Then their models work on these devices, and here's the performance numbers. And so you incentivize all the sales people with, Okay, here's the here's how you sell further, AI to insurance companies, right? So here's two, three slides.

S Speaker 223:44I mean, the idea is that in the world of NCP servers, and so they have this reinforcement learning based agent that auto configures what should be the chain of thought, and at the same time, it will figure out which API to call, and if you have an MCP server, or if you don't have an MCP server, I mean, essentially, it negates the need of having an MCP server altogether, and figures out that in that chain of thought, what should be the input From output from this, and what should be the input to the next? And then which API should I call, or if it's an MCP server, somebody's really element of an MCP server, then again, what should be the input to that MCP server, everything. So it auto figures that out. And it's a super early stage. They just went GA beta, GA

S Speaker 124:47Very cool. And you do some series, a seed, big seed, 12 million seed, that's amazing.
Very cool. And you do some series, a seed, big seed, 12 million seed, that's amazing.

25:07yeah. That's happening like we
yeah. That's happening like we
yeah. That's happening like we
yeah. That's happening like we
S Speaker 225:09did another one context.ai. Which is also another 11, $12 million seed. Whoa, that's the Joe that I'm talking
did another one context.ai. Which is also another 11, $12 million seed. Whoa, that's the Joe that I'm talking
did another one context.ai. Which is also another 11, $12 million seed. Whoa, that's the Joe that I'm talking
did another one context.ai. Which is also another 11, $12 million seed. Whoa, that's the Joe that I'm talking
S Speaker 125:15about. Got it, yeah, it's interesting. Yeah. And are you, like, leading the rounds? You're participating in the rounds. Are you thinking about that? We lead?
about. Got it, yeah, it's interesting. Yeah. And are you, like, leading the rounds? You're participating in the rounds. Are you thinking about that? We lead?

about. Got it, yeah, it's interesting. Yeah. And are you, like, leading the rounds? You're participating in the rounds. Are you thinking about that? We lead?
S Speaker 225:24We so in both of these, we entered after they had we found out about after they had lead.
We so in both of these, we entered after they had we found out about after they had lead.
We so in both of these, we entered after they had we found out about after they had lead.
We so in both of these, we entered after they had we found out about after they had lead.
S Speaker 225:35So in both of these, our seed checks are, anyways, 2 million. It's like for seed, and especially, like a 10, $12 million seed. Yeah, I'm not putting $5 million in seed, because our max check size is 10, right? So depending on the round, like, for example, I can lead with a $10 million check in a Series A and B. I cannot lead with a 10, but I cannot lead in a Series C. Makes sense? Yay. God, so and I don't do lead with in seeds, where the seeds are 10, 12, million, which is the case these days.
So in both of these, our seed checks are, anyways, 2 million. It's like for seed, and especially, like a 10, $12 million seed.

S Speaker 126:18Yeah. Is it as common? Because we did. We wanted to do a smaller but didn't want to do like, a two minute seed. We did a five minute seed. So we're like, okay, let's
Yeah. Is it as common? Because we did. We wanted to do a smaller but didn't want to do like, a two minute seed. We did a five minute seed. So we're like, okay, let's
Yeah. Is it as common? Because we did. We wanted to do a smaller but didn't want to do like, a two minute seed. We did a five minute seed. So we're like, okay, let's
Yeah. Is it as common? Because we did. We wanted to do a smaller but didn't want to do like, a two minute seed. We did a five minute seed. So we're like, okay, let's
S Speaker 226:28getting, I mean, these days, right now, in AI, the seeds are becoming bigger. I wouldn't say like it like, depending like, if you were to really, it's only specific areas, like if you're building, if you're if you have some sort of an infra play that makes sense, infra play with a founder
getting, I mean, these days, right now, in AI, the seeds are becoming bigger. I wouldn't say like it like, depending like, if you were to really, it's only specific areas, like if you're building, if you're if you have some sort of an infra play that makes sense, infra play with a founder

26:54to raise, yeah, and you'll
to raise, yeah, and you'll
to raise, yeah, and you'll
to raise, yeah, and you'll
S Speaker 226:58you'll see, Then you'll see a lot of people chasing so then all of a sudden that seed becomes
you'll see, Then you'll see a lot of people chasing so then all of a sudden that seed becomes
you'll see, Then you'll see a lot of people chasing so then all of a sudden that seed becomes
you'll see, Then you'll see a lot of people chasing so then all of a sudden that seed becomes
S Speaker 127:05big. Understood. How do you see about like, the Series A? Are the benchmarks I know, the growth above anything else is what I feel as well, but all the preventive benchmarks and so on, Series
big. Understood. How do you see about like, the Series A? Are the benchmarks I know, the growth above anything else is what I feel as well, but all the preventive benchmarks and so on, Series

27:17series it all depends
series it all depends
series it all depends
series it all depends
S Speaker 227:20which space. So in case of, let's say, for example, the space where you're building InsurTech, and
which space. So in case of, let's say, for example, the space where you're building InsurTech, and
which space. So in case of, let's say, for example, the space where you're building InsurTech, and
which space. So in case of, let's say, for example, the space where you're building InsurTech, and
27:28which is a vertical
S Speaker 227:34I'd say, depending on how see, you can raise a series AR, $1 million Arr, you can raise a Series A at 500 kRR, you can raise a Series A at 3 million. It all depends on how you want to price. It makes sense. Yeah, so we're looking at what's that contract manager, what's the is that series B or Series A? That series B,
I'd say, depending on how see, you can raise a series AR, $1 million Arr, you can raise a Series A at 500 kRR, you can raise a Series A at 3 million. It all depends on how you want to price.

28:05Series B? So they're at 20,
Series B? So they're at 20,
Series B? So they're at 20,
Series B? So they're at 20,
S Speaker 228:08Series B at 20, yeah, Series B at 20. That's That's nice, yeah. So there are, and
Series B at 20, yeah, Series B at 20. That's That's nice, yeah. So there are, and
Series B at 20, yeah, Series B at 20. That's That's nice, yeah. So there are, and
Series B at 20, yeah, Series B at 20. That's That's nice, yeah. So there are, and
28:15how quickly did they get there? Is it like
how quickly did they get there? Is it like
how quickly did they get there? Is it like
how quickly did they get there? Is it like
S Speaker 228:18they've pivoted a whole bunch of times, and it's like in contract management, but now not pivoted bunch of times. Actually pivoted once, initially and then, so it was 21 is when they had their first dollars. And then from 21 through now, yeah, but last year was 2x Okay, last year was 2x and then this year again is
they've pivoted a whole bunch of times, and it's like in contract management, but now not pivoted bunch of times.

28:49close to 2x Yeah. I do feel that
close to 2x Yeah. I do feel that
close to 2x Yeah. I do feel that
close to 2x Yeah. I do feel that
S Speaker 128:53like from an industry perspective, what we are seeing as well, the land is hard, yeah, but the Expand is super easy, yeah. And if the product is architected in a way that you built for London, expand that growth to a million might takes eight months or nine months, but one to 10 Minute can happen in like one quarter or two, because all of the existing contracts will not have, like this use case, that use case, and that's starting to happen to us. We don't have the bandwidth to support that right now. That's what we need to build. But, yeah, at one year, doubling from 10 to 20, I can see that happen very easily. Yeah, expansion is set up. Well,
like from an industry perspective, what we are seeing as well, the land is hard, yeah, but the Expand is super easy, yeah.
