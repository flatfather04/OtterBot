S Speaker 11:04So the next question of your business plans is 30% Is this legal? Oh, and you'll probably want to write if it is different. Make sure that it's aligned and you have that corrected for your final map. Right. And I like your response to that. So yes. Okay, yeah. Yeah. God asked about the workflow and what happens in the case of an emergency. Is it real time review from the doctors? I noticed that your when you answered and during your response, she was nodding and like really liked it. So I think that's a question that tends to pop up a lot and you guys are getting good on on answering that pretty concisely. Jim, asked, what is the difficulty or what is the most difficult thing about going after the rural population?

S Speaker 12:39love that you interview the patients. So good job putting that out there and emphasizing that. However, you have a lot to work out on the operating model, renting the equipment workflow of reading and response, EMR integrations. She says the devils in the detail which is I think something that we've already known, right like as you're going to plan out the next steps. What's important is figuring out how you actually do it all again, like it's not something that's impossible. It's just takes time. That's my comment. It's see spend time assess, does this result, improve outcomes? And then the comment on CMMI Okay, which is interesting. Okay. So I had forgotten about that one. That was a good one. Yeah, right Medicare Medicaid. CMMI. Byron, he loved the company name and started off strong talking about stillbirths, and he said that he liked you taking modern
love that you interview the patients. So good job putting that out there and emphasizing that.

S Speaker 13:50the end. So that's interesting. And I know that's something that we've been trying to work on is how do we make this even clearer? I think you were pretty clear, but again, maybe even finding a way to just emphasize that even more, okay. One thing that worries him is the burden of on the physician of the back and forth messaging, and is the CBT code enough to expand expand their practice to do that? Yeah. Okay. And of the 441 million market, how much of the existing market has something like that thing done already? Versus market development? And I see where he's coming from on that, right? Because that could take extra effort with development. Would you mind repeating that one? Yes. He said, and this was his numbers. I think this is on your slide. That's 441 million market. How much of this is with something
the end. So that's interesting. And I know that's something that we've been trying to work on is how do we make this even clearer?

S Speaker 24:52that is already being done? So I think what he's trying to ask right is, are you trying to just steal business away from the competitor, which they are writing something that's already being done? I'm assuming that's what he means at home versus market development having to go with I mean, honestly, it's, I interpret it as right is or do you have to go and educate people on on doing this at home, but no one's doing this directly? Or maybe he means do you have to take it take, you know, some of the I guess if people were using this with a different product, but I don't think that there's anything that anyone's doing exactly, so I'm not sure what he exactly means by that but interpret as you wish. Overall, very impressive. and he encourages you to keep moving forward with it. Yeah.

S Speaker 15:46I have a question on this last one on the market because when I heard it,
I have a question on this last one on the market because when I heard it,
I have a question on this last one on the market because when I heard it,
I have a question on this last one on the market because when I heard it,
S Speaker 35:50I also was not sure in which direction they would like the question was pointed Yeah, and it just made me think, going to think your lab now.
I also was not sure in which direction they would like the question was pointed Yeah, and it just made me think, going to think your lab now.
I also was not sure in which direction they would like the question was pointed Yeah, and it just made me think, going to think your lab now.
I also was not sure in which direction they would like the question was pointed Yeah, and it just made me think, going to think your lab now.
S Speaker 36:06After this as of now, and we expect this to also grow because like high risk is growing. And then we expect that just the remote aspect could basically penetrate to all that like the sum more than
After this as of now, and we expect this to also grow because like high risk is growing. And then we expect that just the remote aspect could basically penetrate to all that like the sum more than

After this as of now, and we expect this to also grow because like high risk is growing. And then we expect that just the remote aspect could basically penetrate to all that like the sum more than
S Speaker 16:20the sum, right? Like expanding to the sum. That is the overall high risk pregnant mothers that this becomes just the standard of care. If you have any kind of risk, just go monitor at home and we'll see if we need to do something. How would be like a smart way of presenting the source showing that growth that opportunity that is way larger than those numbers that we're showing
the sum, right? Like expanding to the sum. That is the overall high risk pregnant mothers that this becomes just the standard of care.

S Speaker 36:43You have the percentage growth on the slide, right? Yeah, but it's just IVF.
You have the percentage growth on the slide, right? Yeah, but it's just IVF.
You have the percentage growth on the slide, right? Yeah, but it's just IVF.
You have the percentage growth on the slide, right? Yeah, but it's just IVF.
S Speaker 16:47No, no, I wouldn't say that's that. Yeah, that percentage growth is not for
No, no, I wouldn't say that's that. Yeah, that percentage growth is not for
No, no, I wouldn't say that's that. Yeah, that percentage growth is not for
No, no, I wouldn't say that's that. Yeah, that percentage growth is not for
S Speaker 36:53like one is the IVF growth. One is the overall CCG monitoring growth, but that does not account for the fact that the market will grow bigger if

S Speaker 17:01you start sending these machines back home, you know, like the testing frequency will increase and like, we are actually creating somewhat of a newer market as well. And that is something which is not captured on that slide or we do not talk about right. It may feel like that in that last question. Like that doesn't really, he's not accounting for that either. Yeah, right. So I think you've raised a good point. There's different ways to go about that you can either decide if you want to do when can you edit your slides until for nap? Because they were not sure actually. They sent the date they sent the date. A few more days. We can update the business number nine and the pitch deck by 13 5pm. Like thank you for doing so. And I'm gonna tell you something. I don't know who the judges are yet for GAAP, but they feel like they're going to be more generalists, too, by the way. Yeah. I mean, you'll probably know soon and I think once you know that, I think this is actually like a really interesting lesson too, by the way, like if you know you're going to have a lot of people from the medical world so
you start sending these machines back home, you know, like the testing frequency will increase and like, we are actually creating somewhat of a newer market as well.

what it would be like in five years. but of course like you that would be if you were applying
what it would be like in five years. but of course like you that would be if you were applying
S Speaker 48:43percentage increases and but it could get messy so
S Speaker 18:47you could either just, you know, put the numbers down somewhere or really just speak to it and have a tagline on the bottom and be like, This is where we are now but then like, you know, X years is going to be massive, something like that. I forget what I want to try to pull up a slide. It just really depends what you have on the slide now and you don't want to make it too busy. But you do want to emphasize that point. Yeah. Are you guys looking at the slides? I'm trying to pull up a screenshot of this slide by

S Speaker 19:23Yeah, just give me a moment. I'm like I'm going off of memory. Yeah, just give me a moment. growth metrics and then some wine like little bullet points yes my little my favorite one in the yellow okay just send you to iMessage Eric

S Speaker 111:15to tech I'm liking that too. Okay. And then Jim's overall comments is that you're addressing an immense need for health equity again, they all really like that angle. But then he his concern is that you know, are you going to raise enough money to keep this going until you basically can reach all the rural people and you know, until then he thinks that maybe you might run out of money, and instead I'm smiling and I know you guys were smiling to know that you go after the wealthy parents first. And of course, he uses my favorite examples, which is this new and the outlet sock. Which I have both of and where's the first room the early adopters for, but I think that, you know, I know that you know, the population to go after, but maybe there is some sort of consideration like, Can you do a little bit of this in the beginning to get enough money,
to tech I'm liking that too. Okay. And then Jim's overall comments is that you're addressing an immense need for health equity again, they all really like that angle.

Which I have both of and where's the first room the early adopters for, but I think that, you know, I know that you know, the population to go after, but maybe there is some sort of consideration like, Can you do a little bit of this in the beginning to get enough money,
