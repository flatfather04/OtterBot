1:15Yeah, a lot of learning. Of course, we moved to,
Yeah, a lot of learning. Of course, we moved to,
Yeah, a lot of learning. Of course, we moved to,
Yeah, a lot of learning. Of course, we moved to,
S Speaker 31:22I think we came a long way, but so we sold like couple 100 device to DEF CON. And were
I think we came a long way, but so we sold like couple 100 device to DEF CON. And were

1:36previous version, yeah,
previous version, yeah,
previous version, yeah,
previous version, yeah,
S Speaker 31:38which was like local AI capability, all that. So the basically, they bought it as a bell medical batch. So we put some like medical models in the device and like just so like that interesting.

It's not kind of medical models, if you can mention
2:00there's one like, just a common crime model,
there's one like, just a common crime model,

there's one like, just a common crime model,
2:06and there's another one
and there's another one
and there's another one
and there's another one
2:10called Mad, Mad gamma. It's an

2:13open source Google model, okay,

2:16yeah, we, we didn't really enjoy
yeah, we, we didn't really enjoy
yeah, we, we didn't really enjoy
yeah, we, we didn't really enjoy
S Speaker 32:22May because just realize we don't like B to B, yeah, yeah. It feels like we're working for someone else again, and kind of defeat the purpose of we quitting our job and starting our startup.
May because just realize we don't like B to B, yeah, yeah. It feels like we're working for someone else again, and kind of defeat the purpose of we quitting our job and starting our startup.

2:40Yeah, yeah. So after that,
Yeah, yeah. So after that,
Yeah, yeah. So after that,
Yeah, yeah. So after that,
S Speaker 33:45the customer enjoyment didn't came from, it's a local model or not? Yeah, it came from the creation part. So kind of a better lesson so we can we dropped that local model was saying that they used to be our main thing, yes.
the customer enjoyment didn't came from, it's a local model or not? Yeah, it came from the creation part. So kind of a better lesson so we can we dropped that local model was saying that they used to be our main thing, yes.

S Speaker 14:02But so now it is local, or is it hybrid in that sense? Yeah.
But so now it is local, or is it hybrid in that sense? Yeah.
But so now it is local, or is it hybrid in that sense? Yeah.
But so now it is local, or is it hybrid in that sense? Yeah.
S Speaker 24:10So, because at that point we already build a really good yes base that we build all the SDK and stuff like the hardware supposed to be working very well with AI agent, yeah. So the moment, the moment we connect cloud, open air model to it, it's very good. So it's like, people basically have a magical moment. So they tap in some stuff, it immediately happened, like, okay, code the code the LED, or code the screen. Like, when we deliver the device, we deliver it with a small ESP 30 to work. So we basically made anyone can program a ESP 30 to board, like walls. Like, I don't know anything about hardware, but now I can hack any hardware now, yeah. So that's a turning point for us. Then we immediately start selling.

S Speaker 15:04Yeah, that's That's amazing. And how does the say, what's your target market for the developers? Like, how is the coding interface? Is it more natural language targeted at more non technical people, targeted everyone? Or is it more say, a developer prototype that you're targeting. It.
Yeah, that's That's amazing. And how does the say, what's your target market for the developers? Like, how is the coding interface? Is it more natural language targeted at more non technical people, targeted everyone? Or is it more say, a developer prototype that you're targeting. It.

S Speaker 35:24It's an interesting thing to learn. We didn't know at the beginning, but we slowly learn who is our target user. Yeah, of course, in the beginning, there's always those early adapters who pick it up the device. They are highly technical. Yeah. They they want, they bought device trying to hack all kind of the other device printers, you know, heck, I don't know. They jam it into their car as well.

They they want, they bought device trying to hack all kind of the other device printers, you know, heck, I don't know. They jam it into their car as well.
S Speaker 25:53Then there's cyber security people who love this as well, because they do penetration testing, yeah, and they have, like, penetration testing agent, which they will not run on their laptop. Now they have an actual sandbox to run those agent, so that those are the early customers. Then later we start selling more. There's semi technical, or even non technical, people start picking up, yeah, like very some good example is like designers who build to build, like, like, you know, the Pomodoro timer, yes, like, you know, you count 10 minutes, yeah, it's absolutely decreasing. So the designers feel those kind of product, but have great design, but they just have to put some kind of esprit Arduino in there, but they don't know how to program it, yeah, even on this own a laptop, they don't, still don't know how to how to program it. The most they can do is copy pasting code from chatgpt, yeah, but that that can only get them like this far, yes, but not enough to deliver a product. Yeah, so they just buy our thing, because it's the Linux, and they just connect their adrenal to the device, immediately recognize what Chip connect with, and just start programming. So that's why one example, there's like, Lawyer by us, us as well, which I was very surprising. I was like, what do you what? Why do you need this? So they comment like, this thing enable me, something that Windows cannot do for me. And I'm still very confused. So I took a look how exactly this customer is using it. Yes, it's using chat, chat GPT on the device. So I was like, why? Like, why don't you just use chat GP, like a normal person? Why do you need a device, right? So, and what makes me realize is they all need a file system. It's a Linux, right? So those lawyers they call, they pull like 60 all kinds of documents and all in the device, it's very hard for them to drag 60 documents to chat GPT and let chat BT figure it out. That's all. That's basically impossible. But when they use the agent on there, the agent will just go search the documents. Yeah, so you so the benefit they got is a file system with some kind of AI agent. Super interesting. But there's more example like that. So like non technical people, same in technical people start picking up, yeah,
Then there's cyber security people who love this as well, because they do penetration testing, yeah, and they have, like, penetration testing agent, which they will not run on their laptop.

S Speaker 18:30super interesting. Tianjin, you know. See, there are a lot of startups out there. Even the use case that you mentioned about sandbox, initial developer use case of having a sandbox. There are a lot of sandbox companies out there. There are, like, tech digital companies right. There are a lot of storage companies out there. There are a lot of DLP protection companies out there. But just the value proposition of it being a separate hardware makes it so much more, I would say, interesting, and it's it's much more on a deeper level that you are as a consumer, much more comfortable in having a sandbox as a separate device, or your file handler as a separate device, understanding that all the data access is just happening over here, and you're still able to sort of use chat GPT to the maximum extent you want, like the best models, the frontier research models, now that you have a hardware, a hybrid architecture, that possible as well, right?

S Speaker 29:32Yeah, yeah. I mean, it just, it bothers me a lot, because I saw, saw those are non happy people suffered, and they end up have to come back to our device, like all the so. So all they need, it's an agent on their computer. Yes, but chat GPT, they don't build computer, and the computer company, they don't have AI agent. So it's like, they have to buy our device to get the drop down now. And, yeah, like you said,
Yeah, yeah. I mean, it just, it bothers me a lot, because I saw, saw those are non happy people suffered, and they end up have to come back to our device, like all the so. So all they need, it's an agent on their computer. Yes, but chat GPT, they don't build computer, and the computer company, they don't have AI agent.

So it's like, they have to buy our device to get the drop down now. And, yeah, like you said,
10:08it's, it's like,
S Speaker 210:12there's no copy out there that's building posts right now. Yeah, yeah.
there's no copy out there that's building posts right now. Yeah, yeah.
there's no copy out there that's building posts right now. Yeah, yeah.
there's no copy out there that's building posts right now. Yeah, yeah.
S Speaker 110:16And just, you can have say, try to pass on the same features, same value through a digital service as well. But in your case, having a hardware form factor, a separate form factor to run compute, actually makes a lot more sense.
And just, you can have say, try to pass on the same features, same value through a digital service as well. But in your case, having a hardware form factor, a separate form factor to run compute, actually makes a lot more sense.

S Speaker 210:34Yeah, because I, I strongly believe in we make money by selling the hardware. Yeah, I don't believe in you make money by reselling tokens. That's like a temporary thing, like, there's no point on me buying token from a third party providers and buying it directly from chatgpt or cloud, yeah.
Yeah, because I, I strongly believe in we make money by selling the hardware. Yeah, I don't believe in you make money by reselling tokens. That's like a temporary thing, like, there's no point on me buying token from a third party providers and buying it directly from chatgpt or cloud, yeah.

S Speaker 110:52And so two questions, Tianji, this is super, super interesting space, right? Two questions, how are you thinking this evolving right, or where is your and the team's main focus is for the next few months? Do you see, say, on the developer platform, where you can program the hardware? Do you see a lot of focus going in there? Or do you sort of focus more on getting the hardware better and the compute side of things better. How are you thinking about it?

And so two questions, Tianji, this is super, super interesting space, right? Two questions, how are you thinking this evolving right, or where is your and the team's main focus is for the next few months? Do you see, say, on the developer platform, where you can program the hardware? Do you see a lot of focus going in there? Or do you sort of focus more on getting the hardware better and the compute side of things better. How are you thinking about it?
S Speaker 211:27We our hardware already got into a stable stage. Yes, we are prepared. We are actually preparing different SKU right now. We are working on one, one that's smaller, it's like a key keychain, and another that's bigger, like a tower that runs all local So, but for this one, we're maturing the development on this because, like on September, we sold 40 device. Then October, we sold like 70 plus. November, we sold 100 plus. So we're quickly, we it's gonna, it's quickly growing into, we're gonna sell 300 to 1000 US per month, yeah, which we're working on, basically scaling up the production right now. We hired people at SF, just like we put a small symbol line assembly line, that's not gonna work well if we sell hundreds of them. So that's this, where the hardware it's at, in terms of software like this is basically, this is one of the US interface, yes, like, you know, I just chatting with the agents. This is a link to the device. You can pull the device anywhere you want and just remotely command the agents we need, like, data analysis for us, or whatever agent you running the vision.

12:58It's like, this is going to slowly replace your laptop.
It's like, this is going to slowly replace your laptop.
It's like, this is going to slowly replace your laptop.
It's like, this is going to slowly replace your laptop.
13:02Like for our team,
S Speaker 213:05where we have a train trend right now, so all the team members have to use iPad, yeah? Like we have this small app. Okay?
where we have a train trend right now, so all the team members have to use iPad, yeah? Like we have this small app. Okay?

13:22Do did I get stuck
S Speaker 113:31Hey, tmchi, sorry it got stuck. Can you hear me now? Oh, okay, okay, yes, yes, I did not hear the say last one minute or so, yeah.
Hey, tmchi, sorry it got stuck. Can you hear me now? Oh, okay, okay, yes, yes, I did not hear the say last one minute or so, yeah.

S Speaker 114:47Makes sense. Makes sense. I believe in that. I understand this. There's like a path to going from where you are to actually replacing the laptop, because just the form factor, the screen, the user interface being designed for a laptop, sort of a form factor, takes some time to replace it, but I think I'm sure, like you're thinking about it in the right way. I also feel like on the coding interface that you have to code the hardware that can take an entire, say, sort of a journey that the current White coding apps are taking like white coding apps initially were just front end, then they come in with front end plus back end, plus security, plus or plus a lot of packages already in there as templates once you have that, or maybe you can even go about a marketplace skill sharing model. And once you have that piece, it becomes a completely new form factor, with Compute and with entire usage, yep, yep, wow, that's that's pretty amazing. Tianji, I am a love how things have evolved. How are you thinking about say, the initial foundation was running models locally. Now you have more of a hybrid approach, right? What are there any say, compute, cost benefits, latency benefits that the current hybrid architecture gives you. Say, I'm thinking, if I can run the entire my entire open AI chat GPT account on my mobile, versus if I shift to Pamir, does that give me some sort of a cost advantage as well in terms of compute cost running things?
Makes sense. Makes sense. I believe in that. I understand this.

S Speaker 216:32Yeah, so I don't believe in running model on your phone, because it just doesn't make sense like I might like my phone supposed to be working 10 hours per day. Now I run your agent. It works only three hours per day now, so it just, it doesn't make sense. The phone supposed to be the interface. It should stay at an interface. So the same way building is computer for the agent, which means if you there's multiple bar, you can scale right? You can scale the agent. Can scale context. You can also scale the compute, which means the more computing give it to do it, the more work it can get done. Yeah, as for right now, most of our software related work can devote to the device, but some heavy work, like build a Linux image, I cannot put on device. It's going to take it like three hours to build the Linux image. Well, that we still have to do it, which means that part is still my work, my job. Yes, correct. So, but imagine this is still to like a laptop, PC compute level, it can go build its own Linux image now, okay, it took that part of job off me. So that's how, when I'm thinking about computers, that's, that's, that's like a scale, you can scale up and down. You know, we if you don't need that much compute, you buy a smaller device. Yeah, yeah. And in terms of local model, I thought about it, I just don't, I mean, there's company building that on the market, which means there is a demand for it. But I just, I just think there's bigger saying to do right now.
Yeah, so I don't believe in running model on your phone, because it just doesn't make sense like I might like my phone supposed to be working 10 hours per day. Now I run your agent.

S Speaker 118:09I agree. I agree. What I'm thinking about, from a local model perspective, is say you would need for most if you say you run, you look at all the users you have today and the uses, the kind of use that they are making out of the hardware, you will see there are a few buckets or say few things that are repeated in most of the workflows. Let's say you would see a speech to text model being run almost every time say, for example, or if you see some sort of a summarizing function being run every time, do you sort of create an orchestration engine which runs on top of the hardware and realizes that for these buckets, let's just have the device run some things. Or is, will it be more free flowing than that? Is my question,
I agree. I agree.

Or is, will it be more free flowing than that? Is my question,
S Speaker 219:01yeah, yeah, that's a great question, and there's a market for that. But we are startup, we have limited resources. We decide to not focus on this in cost. I just okay, I believe those models will get commoditized. Yeah, it's not, it's not our job to make it, optimize it or make it wrong, because it will run, it will reach to state of art, eventually it will get commoditized. So we, as a small startup at this stage, we need something compounding. So like working on those local model today is not a compounding action, meaning, like, if we're what, what is moving fastest in the industry right now? Like agent, right? Yeah, and cloud is working on agent every single day, even, even if the company don't do anything today, we're still compounding. We're kicking back with Cloud growth. Yes, if we're working on local model, we spend six months trying to optimize a local model. What are we compounding? You know, nothing.
yeah, yeah, that's a great question, and there's a market for that. But we are startup, we have limited resources. We decide to not focus on this in cost.

S Speaker 120:04Yeah, yeah. Makes sense. Makes sense. Totally. Get that agreed, yeah, very interesting approach. Tianjin, glad we had this chat. What's your thought about some of the other form factors that are coming in, right? There are ring form factors, locket, form factors, all of this. They come in with one specific vertical, one specific use case in mind. It's not programmable. I see all the differentiation, but thoughts about how that market will evolve.
Yeah, yeah. Makes sense. Makes sense. Totally. Get that agreed, yeah, very interesting approach. Tianjin, glad we had this chat.

S Speaker 220:36I'm not a strong behavior replacing your existing interface, because we already got enough interface. I have my phone, I have my iPad, you know, I have my laptop. So trying to replace that, I don't think that some some play you should do as a small startup. Yes, most, most likely people not gonna put two device in their pocket. So yeah, and the phone is gonna be there to stay, but I'm more leaning towards how to utilize them and how to cooperate with the current, existing form factor. Yeah, one only form factor I'm looking forward to is AR glasses, and I believe it's gonna happen in, like, very soon, like two or three years, you're gonna get a really good VR glasses that's light and have, you know, good interface, like eye tracking, or even the the meta band. Very soon, there'll be third party support that selling the exactly band. So that's gonna be a pivoting point for us, if you get a really good air glasses, this will be perfect, right? Because all your glasses need a compute compute module, yeah, and work to guess where all your contacts and products store that you know your Asian computer. So that's, that's one thing I'm anticipating, and we are making plan towards that.

S Speaker 122:02Yeah, super interesting. Tianji, so say again, like we discussed the target market you're thinking of right now, right? One of these companies say a locket company comes in and its core value proposition is, I will record your entire day, conversations through your entire day. I'll create memories for you, and these based on these memories, you can have better answers or something like that, right? That's one particular use case that that locket form factor is targeting today, but that same use case can also be served by you, right? In some sense, you can have the hardware programmed in that way that it records your audio for whatever time it runs and creates memory on top of it. Do you see different kind of form factors coming in, taking in slice by slice of different use cases of the market or and how do you see yourself positioned in that way.
Yeah, super interesting. Tianji, so say again, like we discussed the target market you're thinking of right now, right? One of these companies say a locket company comes in and its core value proposition is, I will record your entire day, conversations through your entire day. I'll create memories for you, and these based on these memories, you can have better answers or something like that, right? That's one particular use case that that locket form factor is targeting today, but that same use case can also be served by you, right? In some sense, you can have the hardware programmed in that way that it records your audio for whatever time it runs and creates memory on top of it. Do you see different kind of form factors coming in, taking in slice by slice of different use cases of the market or and how do you see yourself positioned in that way.

S Speaker 223:03Well, this there's two kind of startup, like once, one type of the saying you are describing, yeah, it's a it's a one 200 race. It's a problem on the table. Everybody's trying to solve that problem. So who, who's gonna win? Like, there's, there's, like, at least 50 startups trying to solve that problem, and the only one, so you either all compete them, or you come up with something that just one up them, like, totally novel. Yeah, and when that race, so I don't want to participate in that competition. I'm going to create my own category. I'm going to be zero to one. Well, I just don't think that's again we want to, we want to be in, but I'm sure, so I'm sure white collars, they all need that kind of device, and there's at least 10 options on the market than for you, for you to pick right now, we're more targeting to those people who who love to use Asian and trying to replace partial of their workforce. Yeah, put that thing onto a compute and let it work in the background, and the whole team can access to it, like, for example, like, how we tracking our inventory right now? Yeah. So while hardware compete, our hardware engineer, builder, builder, inventory tracking, agent and put on device, and all the team have access to it, so even if the hardware team is taking time off, right, well, we don't have message now. We just message to the device. Hey, what's inventory right now? Do I need to order something? You know? Okay, fine, I'll order it, even if the hardware engineer is not there.
Well, this there's two kind of startup, like once, one type of the saying you are describing, yeah, it's a it's a one 200 race. It's a problem on the table. Everybody's trying to solve that problem.

S Speaker 225:05a heads on app right now? Yeah, right. So, so right now, the web app on phone, it working great. The the on the web browser, it's a VS code so, so we pretty much have it, have everything that those customer, technical customer, needed right now, yeah, but we're trying to do some innovation right here that trying to extract the core value out of it, because we don't want to compute in the VS code space. There's already enough company doing that, so where has done based on the user feedback, we developed some kind of app, either on a phone or iPad or desktop, that can work along with you, so you can have like Tik Tok on on the right part and the agent on the left part. That's That's what we'll be focused on in the next two months. What? Because we never launched yet. So we're gonna have, we're gonna, we're gonna have a really good app, yeah, after production ready, we launch, yes, we're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna reach to 1000 device per month, solid sales at in two months. That's my plan.
a heads on app right now? Yeah, right. So, so right now, the web app on phone, it working great.

26:20Yeah, launch, after that or before that.
Yeah, launch, after that or before that.
Yeah, launch, after that or before that.
Yeah, launch, after that or before that.
S Speaker 226:24We, even if we don't launch, I can look slowly ramp up to that, yeah, because I'm pretty sure we already find the group of people who need less. All we need to do is just, and there's word of mouth happening already, like 30% of the cells coming from organic.
We, even if we don't launch, I can look slowly ramp up to that, yeah, because I'm pretty sure we already find the group of people who need less. All we need to do is just, and there's word of mouth happening already, like 30% of the cells coming from organic.

Well, the launch just gonna accelerate that. Yeah.
Well, the launch just gonna accelerate that. Yeah.
26:47Well, my spirit rich
S Speaker 326:49to that we can, like with a Series A and spend more time to expand. SKU, Yeah,

I would be willing to pay close to 400 for sure, makes sense. Makes sense, totally super interesting. Would love to sort of stay connected till the time you you're raising a Series A when do you or do you think of opening it up for other developers to build on top of your compute? Anytime soon?

S Speaker 228:21have a lot of actual consumer use case and extract pattern out of it, and double down on that. If you give it to developers, they're going to try to build all kinds of stuff. But still, you the hidden pattern. I believe there's some kind of hidden pattern underneath, and we just have to get that out, meaning, like developer bison, you know what they do,
have a lot of actual consumer use case and extract pattern out of it, and double down on that. If you give it to developers, they're going to try to build all kinds of stuff.

S Speaker 228:51and after work. That's your second job. They're doing two job, yeah? So they're using the time in the day job to do their second job, which running out there, yeah? Which is interesting. I think there's some some hidden saying behind that we can extract all of it and make it package into a consumer product.
and after work. That's your second job. They're doing two job, yeah? So they're using the time in the day job to do their second job, which running out there, yeah? Which is interesting.

S Speaker 129:11I agree. There is definitely a lot of trends that you will start seeing Once users start using it at scale. You you're tracking a lot of use cases, right? How have you designed it internally to sort of evaluate how people are using it, and then how are you tracking it?

S Speaker 229:55I have, I have a, this is my data on that. We don't have data engineers so, but this is my data engineer, yeah. So it, it goes through the chat history, extracts interesting session for me. And every day a host, a host the session for me, yeah, like every this is basically every day I'll go, go there, take a look. Yes, this is a chat history. What exactly everyone's doing, yeah, yeah, that's all so like, the way all the company to move faster is trying to replace as much people, like resource as an agent, agree,
I have, I have a, this is my data on that. We don't have data engineers so, but this is my data engineer, yeah. So it, it goes through the chat history, extracts interesting session for me.

S Speaker 130:32I guess, yeah, yeah. If you're building, say, a company which will allow people to do that, you should do that yourself as well. So of course, yeah, and super interesting. Love, love, how the progress has been. I know the last time we tried to connect Qualcomm business unit, that did not work very well because there wasn't a lot of scale. But I'm sure if say you reach the 1000 users per month, these guys will be much more, much more willing to have a chat and engage more deeply. So we will, whenever you feel that you're ready, let me know. I'll restart those conversations
I guess, yeah, yeah. If you're building, say, a company which will allow people to do that, you should do that yourself as well. So of course, yeah, and super interesting.

S Speaker 131:50yep, yep. Would be, would be a great time to chat again. Tianji, whenever you have, say, any business report or anything like that, prepared right if you are working on something or for any conference or anything like that. Send that my way as well. I am happy to take a look, sort of give you feedback as the at the same time, we'll keep the Qualcomm teams involved and informed about how this is happening, and then when the time is right, we can, we can restart that discussion
