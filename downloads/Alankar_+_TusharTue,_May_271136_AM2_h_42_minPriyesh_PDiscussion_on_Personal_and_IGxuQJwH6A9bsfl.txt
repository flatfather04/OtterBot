S Speaker 14:11So the common friend that I'm talking about who introduced Nikesh and I, we, I like, I have known her since our internship, actually in Qualcomm, Hyderabad. So that's how I came to know her, and she is a very close friend even now, like she lives very close by, so she connected the two of us, and because both of us were going to CMU and we were roommates, that's how we became roommates in CMU, and have been very close friends as well. Okay,

that's good, yeah. And so at Google, both of you are in the same team
S Speaker 14:40or different team, same all. So we were in search, but different parts of search. I was more involved in features and quality for retrieval and the embedding models for retrieval quality. Nidish has been more involved in llms on search. So this was extractive question answering first, and then generative question answering after chat. GPT, so yeah, different parts of the stack, but in the same hall,
or different team, same all. So we were in search, but different parts of search. I was more involved in features and quality for retrieval and the embedding models for retrieval quality.

you guys are both part of Yeah. Search
S Speaker 15:16is like 6000 people, yeah, and search quality are all and Gemini team is still part of search or separate. It's separate, yeah. So Google DeepMind is, like,
is like 6000 people, yeah, and search quality are all and Gemini team is still part of search or separate. It's separate, yeah. So Google DeepMind is, like,

again, 6000 people as well. And so Gemini is like, oh, Gemini
S Speaker 25:31is part of DeepMind. Yes. Okay, I just might have graduated from DeepMind to, you know, typically what they do is like they used to do, I don't know they used to not have depth Deep Mind to right, commercialization,
is part of DeepMind. Yes. Okay, I just might have graduated from DeepMind to, you know, typically what they do is like they used to do, I don't know they used to not have depth Deep Mind to right, commercialization,

S Speaker 15:44right? So they maybe chat GPT, right, right? Yeah, exactly. So that there were a bunch of changes that happened. So basically Google Brain and Deep Mind combined to form Google Deep Mind. So basically GDM became like the research arm of Google. This was like early 2023 made sense, because three different orgs, Google research, Google Brain, were all pursuing their own foundation models. So that's when this Gemini as a foundation model, black box team started so early 2023 and the funny thing was that the user facing chatbot was called Bard at the time, and then it re christened to Gemini. And then last year, that entire team of like 1000 people moved to Google deep mine. It makes a ton of sense. Otherwise,

6:37Bard, Gemini. Now everything
Bard, Gemini. Now everything
Bard, Gemini. Now everything
Bard, Gemini. Now everything
S Speaker 16:39is Gemini, but everything is Gemini with different with different models, I guess, yeah, become an overloaded term sometimes, like, when we try to use, like, we have to specify Gemini app, Gemini or Gemini the model. And sometimes we just, like, call it bar. It's like, it's too confusing. We're talking about Bard. Yeah, so yeah, things have changed a lot in Google. My art has also increased a lot. So our VP was, I don't know if you know him, like Pandu Nayak. He's been like a Google legend. He actually recently stepped down and became an IC. He became chief scientist for like all our Google search and then our VP changed. He is now chilu. He was an apple before we seen him over. Before that, he was in Google. So now this like 800 person organization called Search Quality, now become 1300 1400 people. Name now has also changes search intelligence. So, yeah, that's what we are now. A lot of changes
is Gemini, but everything is Gemini with different with different models, I guess, yeah, become an overloaded term sometimes, like, when we try to use, like, we have to specify Gemini app, Gemini or Gemini the model. And sometimes we just, like, call it bar. It's like, it's too confusing. We're talking about Bard. Yeah, so yeah, things have changed a lot in Google. My art has also increased a lot.

search ads, in my opinion, to search these days. Gemini answer is, you don't click,
S Speaker 18:27right? Yeah, it's a challenging balancing act, right? So on one side, one hand, I mean, 20% of Google searches have ads. The rest of the 80% don't, and those 20% power all of revenue that comes from Google search, and not all of those queries have the Gemini AI overviews answer. A small segment of those have so that's why like ads so far has been has not been affected to the same extent. But at the same time as Gemini increases in its coverage, some of those ads will have the Gemini overview, and then people might skip ads, having said that the places where Gemini like so these were all experiments that were being run internally right to identify like the slice where we wanted to launch this shopping slice was where AI overviews and some of these AI powered features did not perform as well, which is Why, for for the key like shopping, commercial queries, you still see those ads and like products, which is what the users are looking for, looking for options, exactly. Yeah, so Exactly. And that was very interesting to see that the core thing where we are making money from is still unaffected.
right? Yeah, it's a challenging balancing act, right? So on one side, one hand, I mean, 20% of Google searches have ads.

S Speaker 110:06bit, there's like a 3000 person team just doing Google Shopping, so it's huge because of that reason. And you know, like Amazon. The other thing, the headwind for Google in shopping space is that Amazon search has improved drastically in the last five years. So people used to start their journeys on Google search and then go to Amazon. Now they start their journeys on Amazon, and that has been a headwind that Google is dealing with on the shopping slice, because it's a monetized, heavily monetized slice, and then Tiktok. Gen Z is doing their shopping on Tiktok, and that is a big existential body for Google. So those are big, big tailwinds. I feel chenya is actually a tailwind for Google, obviously, like it still needs to figure out AI mode, which has now come up, versus AI overviews, and where the users go. But AI overviews is rapidly increasing Google search traffic. So now, essentially, users come in and then they like these answers, and then now they issue more queries, and a bunch of those queries are monetized, so even if AI overviews does not trigger for monetized. So for example, let's say that I am issuing a query which is an answer seeking query, so I see that answer which didn't exist earlier, and now I see that answer, I'm happier, right? So I have a bunch of more follow ups and some of those follow up queries, because now I like Google search more, I'll issue those queries on Google as well. And some of those follow ups might be monetized, monetized queries. So that's how it drives Google Exactly. So you like the product more,

S Speaker 111:46So that's the thing that, even before generative AI, right? Like the web answer. This is the all Nitish was in where, like, extractive question answering, basically take a snippet from an existing web page and show that as an answer when you would search for something like, why is the sky blue, right? So they did this study over like a year where they basically ran an ablation. What happens when you remove those answers? What they saw was that not only insulin growth was reducing, that people were looking for answers, seeking queries like those go down at the same time for Google search as a whole, traffic was reducing. So that was really interesting, that answers actually increased Google usage. So Google Search usage, yeah,

S Speaker 212:34and these things are not obvious until you actually start seeing behaviors Exactly. But like for example, there's a lot of doom about Google because, tragically, is taking up a lot of search traffic. But maybe that becomes a tail end instead of a head down, because Google still has massive distribution. I think the only challenge for Google would be if at some point, Apple ends up in the Apple ends up releasing them from their default. That's a huge traffic.

S Speaker 213:18happening, then right now, what Google Pay is $20 million Yeah, it's crazy a year Apple, yeah, so, yeah, I think that money
happening, then right now, what Google Pay is $20 million Yeah, it's crazy a year Apple, yeah, so, yeah, I think that money

13:47it's been starting
S Speaker 113:50your own. We've been wanting to do this for a long time, both of us, and I think for me, just the kind of things that were being enabled through AI outside of Google gave me a whole bunch of promo apps, like, if I continue at Google, this is the small set of things. So big companies enable specialization. That's what I really learned and enjoyed. But I realized that the opportunity outside was bigger.

14:17So the timing played a
So the timing played a
So the timing played a
So the timing played a
S Speaker 114:20big role in terms of AI, where things were going into the eye. I think the second part for me personally, was that I was really looking for breadth as well. I wanted to go beyond just the tech, also look at product and hiring and sales and understand the whole gamut of things that are required to build a company. So that's, that's the other thing that gave me to sort of take this decision. It's a Yeah, I might eat my words, like a year down the line when, you know, like my our hairs are on fire, like nobody is Yeah, so, but I mean, all I can tell you is, like, all the founders, I the founders who make that decision, you Ask them, even when their hair is required.

26:56but everything else
S Speaker 226:58in the stack is a build versus buy this company. So what that typically seems is that they end up leaning towards a build because I'll tell you why these ml engineers are the toughest to sell. These
in the stack is a build versus buy this company. So what that typically seems is that they end up leaning towards a build because I'll tell you why these ml engineers are the toughest to sell. These

S Speaker 227:19that they can build. And then the only reason why weights and biases work is because weights and biases said, I'm going to solve the super easy part, super easy and super boring part that you don't want to see, which is essentially, it's
that they can build. And then the only reason why weights and biases work is because weights and biases said, I'm going to solve the super easy part, super easy and super boring part that you don't want to see, which is essentially, it's

So no ml engineer takes pride in the thing about
So no ml engineer takes pride in the thing about
S Speaker 227:53ml engineers take pride in building better training mechanism, building inference stacks, compilers and runtime ml engineers all take pride. So what I've seen is it

S Speaker 228:15So how, how are you thinking ml? Building ml, the world where, I think the world where these ml models get strong enough, is that if they're tackling what I'm trying to say is you can sell the product if you're a few orders of magnitude.
So how, how are you thinking ml? Building ml, the world where, I think the world where these ml models get strong enough, is that if they're tackling what I'm trying to say is you can sell the product if you're a few orders of magnitude.

To say that, I've been in many, I used to take
To say that, I've been in many, I used to take
S Speaker 228:42many customer calls with many of my portfolio companies to try and understand biopersonality For more detail. And then, as you can imagine, at Qualcomm as well, we have like,
many customer calls with many of my portfolio companies to try and understand biopersonality For more detail. And then, as you can imagine, at Qualcomm as well, we have like,

28:54hundreds of mm teams and
hundreds of mm teams and
hundreds of mm teams and
hundreds of mm teams and
S Speaker 228:58even selling them. So we were able to make you make weights and bias in
even selling them. So we were able to make you make weights and bias in
even selling them. So we were able to make you make weights and bias in
even selling them. So we were able to make you make weights and bias in
29:04customer right away,
S Speaker 229:07like within the first month, I set up some conversations. Reason why no ml engineer ever wanted to build a version. Same goes for their customers. Were everybody at OpenAI, everybody
like within the first month, I set up some conversations. Reason why no ml engineer ever wanted to build a version. Same goes for their customers. Were everybody at OpenAI, everybody
like within the first month, I set up some conversations. Reason why no ml engineer ever wanted to build a version. Same goes for their customers. Were everybody at OpenAI, everybody

S Speaker 131:58think we recognize the fact that for every stage in the workflow, there are, as you already mentioned, hundreds of point solutions for every single thing, evals, data ingestion, data transformations, model training, deployment. So it became very clear to us that that is not what we want to do, because there is no dirt of those point solutions. In fact, if at all there is an excessive supply of them, that's so one of one of the things that we noticed when we were talking with all these machine learning engineers was this constant feeling of feeling overwhelmed. And one of those feelings stems from the fact that there's so many tools for every single thing that we have to sort of constantly think about, which ones do you use and which ones you don't.

32:51So that's not what we wanted
So that's not what we wanted
So that's not what we wanted
So that's not what we wanted
S Speaker 132:54to do. So we felt the value add will be significantly more it's actually build this agentic layer on top that calls the right tools for the right tools, internal as well as external. Used to be open source frameworks as well. So the value lies not in providing points solutions, but fanning this all together in an agentic fashion. So that's, that's, that's the thinking that we have now coming back to your last bit about which stages do machine learning engineers enjoy and which ones do they don't? This varies a lot. Some this like, first of all, this entire role is to heterogeneous, and varies from company to company and team to team. There is no one, one size fits all. Persona of a machine learning engineer or a data scientist. Just to give you an example, like somebody you were speaking to, they were a data scientist, obviously building predictive models as well. Their pain point was around data engineering. They said, in our company, there are three data engineers, three data scientists for every data engineer. I think it should be the other way around, because I am always just waiting for the right data to then do the rest, because that is where I am more interested. So for them, data engineering provided somebody else we were talking to had built a rag system, and they were asking us, they were interested in learning, how exciting can they make their retrieval work better for longer, long tail queries, for example, like ski resorts, family friendly ski resorts and incidents. Now this is a very informative I recall, because the user might be looking for a complete list of results. So they were brainstorming us for alternative ways to model this problem, and so their interest was more in brainstorming and thought partnership and alternative modeling strategy, their pros and cons, and that part of the workforce. So that is the reason we felt that it's important for us to do this well, end to end. The good thing is we are not taking on the point solution minded, which means that we can call those all of those tools as we deem it, so that that burden is taken away from us, so we can focus on building this orchestration layer that works end to end. And now it really depends on your company, your role has, and your own needs. Where you end up losing it, the more the most some people might use it more for data engineering. Some others might use it for model training. Yet some others, this is another value add for calling these agents right. As a machine learning engineer, when you are training a model, you might do like two or three runs, four runs, five runs, depending on the time you have. These models can go ahead and run like do 100 runs and pick the best model and do that for you, then they can rapidly reduce your iteration cycles. That's where a lot of these machine learning engineers may use this tool. So the use cases recover a lot, essentially. And what we want to do is build it end to end and make it work all of those use cases, but we feel extractable because where llms are and with the specific lens that they are taking here and Agent the station there, rather than building models. That's how I'm thinking about it. Ml, engineers like to build we have these assets, ml
to do. So we felt the value add will be significantly more it's actually build this agentic layer on top that calls the right tools for the right tools, internal as well as external.

39:27flexibility and maintenance for them. And we think that
flexibility and maintenance for them. And we think that
flexibility and maintenance for them. And we think that
flexibility and maintenance for them. And we think that
S Speaker 139:35that trade off is well struck when you make an urgent declare, when all of the existing rules are just female officers, tools. And the model is very flexible with natural language. One of the aspects that is tricky here is, everybody is an expert at very open. For example, to say I am a model trainee. I don't have a lot of opinions on however, but I have a lot of things. But I have a lot of reasons. So most of the ends today that we observe, you give them a broad task and just run through them, write all of the code and control on do everything except for this part. This gave me a lot of control, and I want to stick my hand in and change the design, or don't touch the change, but for all of the other parts of the style. So we want to have that kind of automation and ad hoc control now. Want to have three how much of the parts that you also just get me the data that I want. These are rewarding requirements. Theme I think, yeah, this is an event we are taking here, because I will be honest about it. I think so far, our thesis here is that the reason it has not been done is precisely because of the heterogeneity in the workflows, right? And we feel that models are now heading to that stage where the heterogeneity can actually be productized, and that's why agents matter so much. So look at manners. Right? Manners as a horizontal agent builder platform escaping so many use cases. It's catering to somebody who is doing a travel booking, somebody who wants to write a report, somebody who wants to build a website, then somebody wants to do rewrite. Somebody wants to deliver us. It's machine learning, and this is like a horizontal agent builder platform that they are aiming to build. The key being that they're like this two very preliminary components to the UI conversational interface, and then this agent's control pane. So it's own virtual machine where it's opening the browser, doing those actions or writing code and so on. Manus is taking that scope. We want to create a narrow scope of do this work for AI and machine learning. So even within that there is so much heterogeneity, but that is better, exactly, and yeah, this conversation, because the level of abstraction really matters in it. So you take a financial risk model or unstructured data arrive from there are aspects that are data modeling, evals, and you could sort of make specific
that trade off is well struck when you make an urgent declare, when all of the existing rules are just female officers, tools. And the model is very flexible with natural language.

This gave me a lot of control, and I want to stick my hand in and change the design, or don't touch the change, but for all of the other parts of the style. So we want to have that kind of automation and ad hoc control now. Want to have three how much of the parts that you also just get me the data that I want. These are rewarding requirements. Theme I think, yeah, this is an event we are taking here, because I will be honest about it. I think so far, our thesis here is that the reason it has not been done is precisely because of the heterogeneity in the workflows, right? And we feel that models are now heading to that stage where the heterogeneity can actually be productized, and that's why agents matter so much. So look at manners. Right? Manners as a horizontal agent builder platform escaping so many use cases. It's catering to somebody who is doing a travel booking, somebody who wants to write a report, somebody who wants to build a website, then somebody wants to do rewrite. Somebody wants to deliver us. It's machine learning, and this is like a horizontal agent builder platform that they are aiming to build. The key being that they're like this two very preliminary components to the UI conversational interface, and then this agent's control pane. So it's own virtual machine where it's opening the browser, doing those actions or writing code and so on. Manus is taking that scope. We want to create a narrow scope of do this work for AI and machine learning. So even within that there is so much heterogeneity, but that is better, exactly, and yeah, this conversation, because the level of abstraction really matters in it. So you take a financial risk model or unstructured data arrive from there are aspects that are data modeling, evals, and you could sort of make specific
that trade off is well struck when you make an urgent declare, when all of the existing rules are just female officers, tools. And the model is very flexible with natural language. One of the aspects that is tricky here is, everybody is an expert at very open. For example, to say I am a model trainee. I don't have a lot of opinions on however, but I have a lot of things. But I have a lot of reasons. So most of the ends today that we observe, you give them a broad task and just run through them, write all of the code and control on do everything except for this part.

S Speaker 145:07needed. Even if you focus on one enterprise, maybe they have like two or three vendors that are providing a tool for three of these stages, those that really manages. Manageable and now for every stage, pretty much not every stage in practice, but there's like, an open source equivalent as well. We actually feel that this can be drastically simplified that way as well. So you don't have to have like vendors and points solutions for every single stage.

That comes into the thing where I have seen the most heterogeneity, and I feel that that is going to be Achilles meat for us. We have to get that part right. Really, really well is the data part now as just I was just talking to somebody. This person was like, VP of growth in a startup. So I was talking to him about GTs, like he was telling me a bunch of like these growth problems that they are tackling right like sales funnels and how exactly do you increase your conversion rates? How do you make your marketeers more efficient. Each of those problems as he was describing them to me, were in my mind. And

S Speaker 147:32He named some seven different vendors just for the data itself. Like this provides the company specific data the companies that they reach out to for outbound sales, for example. And then for each company, they're like these, these other sources of data, that they join some seven different tools just for that one country, in one company. So that's why I'm saying

It's just all of this is sitting on top of data, right, without that and without that context, and making that visible work well, it will be very hard for us to do this well, and data also has sensibilities around there, so that's why I felt that. To me, the bigger challenge was getting that insight, rather than, you know, even if there are 1000s of tools right at the end of the day, it's about guiding the right set of APIs, the right set of documentation so the model can call them that, and that is not a very resource.

And if that's true, then, essentially, then you need somebody with relationships to go sell to these engineers. And then, because, see, this lot of times an engineer, engineers at Qualcomm right now really want cursor. They don't know who to talk. They know that these tools get a go to idea for engineers, they want to use cursor, they are approved to use GitHub copilot. So then, then, essentially, your sales now, cursor. What happened is SMB and mid market customers, the engineers were just swiping their own. They have the corporate credit card. It was what, $20 a month.

So in their case, bottoms up, which is now after a certain scale, now that everybody's heard, okay, now, like you can sell large contracts to large customers with top down sales, right?

So there's this all the there's no one formula, but it's just your go to market is that, because if you're building bottoms up, then essentially you'll have to build open source motion host events and meet developers, where they are just a different top down. You need somebody who has sold to large enterprises. You need somebody who's got gray hair and strength. Who's done this for 1520, years? Makes sense?

I don't have to evaluate all the SaaS technical architectures anymore. People are not building that. So I can start my research from today and still be at the same like as everyone else.

S Speaker 11:03:55they should, absolutely, I know we could not get to the discussions around Qualcomm partnership, but if you once you send a memo, I will have a chat with Tushar. I'll get some of those started. Sure, maybe we will need to do a one call with our business development team, but that guy is connected to everyone internally at Qualcomm, so he can get some of those started. So I'll check with Tushar on what's the best way to get those started, and we will see if there's anything we can do over there that's right, yes, we would love to know the nitty gritties of work well for them or did not.

How do you sort of build that? Just using natural language? And I have created an agent for deep research there, which would just give me things around Product Hunt and Reddit, but for some use cases, it's very useful if there's a new idea and I want to see if someone is building or something around that Reddit and Product Hunt are the best places to go through doing this specifically on user generated content. Great. I didn't know about it. Yeah. So times when I want to actually get people's opinions on specific software and tools, actually go to Reddit and like such

Our goal is to basically, just because our understanding of the space has evolved, we need to move very fast, sort of do it definitely in terms of doing this in Bangla, that's the reason we want to raise a bigger round.

S Speaker 11:09:50check in. Did Kusha get what you was looking for like? I wasn't quite sure. So I do know to Shar has a lot of constraint on doing another deal, which would be selling to ml of personal MLS. I I have a hint that that is something that he probably is a little bit hesitant about. At the same time, he would have loved to see if there could be a bottom serve face motion, because, from what I know by talking to him, I know the searchers and mercos and lovable other world is really seeking his interest. But I do think that the agentic infrastructure and having an orchestration like tying it up to not really building your own point solution or even an end to end solutions and sort of having an agenting which in call functions, that's something that as a team, we are very excited about God.
