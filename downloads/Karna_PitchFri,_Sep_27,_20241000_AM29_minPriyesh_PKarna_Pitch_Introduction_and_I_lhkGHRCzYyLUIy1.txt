S Speaker 13:06Yeah, sorry about this. It's easy for us to schedule via teams on our system, so by default, yeah, it goes I will turn on the video. Just give me a minute. I'm just getting settled then. So thanks for taking the time. Hi Raji. Hi

S Speaker 53:51absolutely so Raji and Reshmi, I have had a small discussion with Varsha about Karna we spoke during the 500 startup meeting. So this is a follow up to that. We have brief context, but I guess for the benefit of everyone here, would love to go through the entire pitch with you, and then we can discuss how Qualcomm could be beneficial.

S Speaker 44:15Absolutely we can do that. You know, I'll do a very, very short version of that question so that we can actually keep it for Q and A, I would rather, yeah, really answer the questions you have, rather than just talk, right?

S Speaker 14:41Yeah, absolutely. Rajinder, so you know you are familiar with Intel and Intel Capital. So Qualcomm Ventures has been around for 20 years, and practice expanded as our silicon footprint expanded from phones into IoT robotics, automobile now with the aipc and also in inference chips. So our practice expanded to build software ecosystems surrounding these platforms for both collaboration go to market partnerships. So that's the reason why priyesh reached out to and we said that just at least find out areas of commonality between these initiatives, the investments, you asked a bunch of questions and answered them all quickly. So we have had a smaller seed practice, a larger series onward practice. The check size ranges between three to 10 million, and the reason for that is the flexibility across rounds. We typically do take a board observership in deals that we don't lead. The number of deals led versus syndicated are higher in the emerging geographies in the US. I think it's mainly been syndication, mainly because of the check size from Qualcomm, we are not a volume deal shop. We are more of a work with companies that fit in our initiatives and work with them that's been and hence, our team is quite small. We are 20 investment professionals around the world in the in in the security space or in the AI space. The energy went up in our organization about a year ago, mainly because we have now brought AI capabilities across the board, whether it is in the phone, in the PC, in the automobile or any of the platforms that it goes into. And the flexibility allows, typically the cloud native companies to potentially have a hybrid or an edge offering to reduce cost or to increase privacy or have better latency. And these can be a subset of companies, as we see migration of this AI world over time. We've also enabled AI hub through our partnership with hugging face. So that gives developers an opportunity to have access to these models and have ability to also publish their own models. Your last question about security. So we have been not a prolific investor in the security sector. However, we fortunate. We've been lucky in the past. So the security footprint for Qualcomm included an investment in each of the silicon areas that we talked about. So cybernex was an investment in the IoT space that got acquired Sentinel one was the investment in the aipc, sort of at that time, aipc didn't exist. PC existed as a category. So that was the investment Cloudflare was more on the data center or distributed side of investments. So those have been some of the selective investments. And then we did take a deep dive into companies like behaviorsec, etc. That's the one I had mentioned to you on the email thread. And the goal there was to understand the role of checking some of these bot attacks or be proactive about this. We did not end up investing, given the valuations were quite high, these were witness 2021, and so it did not pass our IC criteria for investment. And you saw one of that position that happened in that in that space recently. So we think there is opportunity, a security obviously, tends to be a very busy space with lots of different approaches. And hence we have taken, we had been not, you know, the practice focused on looking at some of companies that had shown footprint in the selective areas on the platform side, we do offer capabilities. So if you you were aware of Wipro and some of the others editor and so snapback and SDK does offer some of this capability and wealth. And so perhaps there could be opportunities. No, totally. I

S Speaker 49:11know. I know through pick very well, and I know some of the other other provenance things that you know various efforts have been going on. And just between us, I know kartiwami Very well, yeah, and so know some of your portfolio otherwise as well. And I know you can eat who leads? Yeah, I have been in lot of, you know, multiple panels and, like, whatever boards with him. So I was the board chair of the semi Benson census industry group for a couple of, yeah, well, I was supposed to be for a couple of years, but during the pandemic, they they convinced me to hang on for a little longer than I signed up for, among other things. And so and I worked with a lot of your tech team decade ago on some standards for you know, I 3c which is like an I 2c extension on presenting data between sensors and camera and audio and all this stuff. So I've kind of been a partner with Qualcomm on many things, and I'm familiar with some of the strategies. So that's great. I think, you know, I had read up on some of the other things, but I'm going with Cloudflare. That's awesome. Cloudflare. CPO is a friend that I'm trying to convince to become an angel for strategic reasons. So maybe you can, you can convince him to take a look again. I know you know. So that may be interesting. Another one, I won't comment on central one. We have money from CrowdStrike Singapore. I'll keep quiet. But that means that, you know, you have all this exposure, and they're all very different place. And I think you're right. In security, there's, like, lots of different angles to security. I'm not even 100% sure we want we call security or really a fraud threat vector with, like, a big insurance angle. Just so, you know, there are many ways to, you know, it's very early days yet on this side, feedback, right? So I think I'm sharing, but I can't see in my teams what I'm sharing. You guys can see, we
know. I know through pick very well, and I know some of the other other provenance things that you know various efforts have been going on.

S Speaker 111:14can see, we can see that topic. Just, just a quick background, why did you start this company?
can see, we can see that topic. Just, just a quick background, why did you start this company?
can see, we can see that topic. Just, just a quick background, why did you start this company?
can see, we can see that topic. Just, just a quick background, why did you start this company?
15:44story here it is still very early days, though.
S Speaker 415:50yeah. So, you know, our main hypothesis is that all real time business conversations like this are a new surface for attack, and we didn't think of our meetings as even security threat before. So in some sense, it's brand new surface of attack, because it just did. And imagine conservatively, most corporate spend 15% of their time, employees, time in meetings. But the higher up you go in the art shop, that number is very, very high. As you know, how many hours we spend on meetings and how, what percentage of them are hybrid, you know, remote. We feel that it's not only a large market, but it's also growing exponential, right? That's why the timing and our first product. We generally want to build a suite of products around all the AI threats in real time. But our first product is kind of our meetings and our technologies is like, really a combination of many technologies. You know, make sure of expert models. But really the simpler analogy is a bundle of six. We can keep adding sticks to break generated AI's, you know, deep fit. But the deep fake generators that they have to invest a lot in making it look real, whereas in order to find, you know, little edges that are rough, we don't have to build the same layer or the same method. We don't even have to think like the generating B. That's our bigger insight. We think like, how do we like to think about it like, you know, it's like a we just need to find a few rough edges in this finely, you know, woven rope and peel them, rather than go building the rope again to then come back. Most of our competitors are trying to use very similar methodologies of like, you know, very large models and very large, you know, we are not saying for generation that is needed, right, because you're trying to full paper, but for finding whether it's generated or not, you don't always need
yeah. So, you know, our main hypothesis is that all real time business conversations like this are a new surface for attack, and we didn't think of our meetings as even security threat before.

But really the simpler analogy is a bundle of six. We can keep adding sticks to break generated AI's, you know, deep fit. But the deep fake generators that they have to invest a lot in making it look real, whereas in order to find, you know, little edges that are rough, we don't have to build the same layer or the same method. We don't even have to think like the generating B. That's our bigger insight. We think like, how do we like to think about it like, you know, it's like a we just need to find a few rough edges in this finely, you know, woven rope and peel them, rather than go building the rope again to then come back. Most of our competitors are trying to use very similar methodologies of like, you know, very large models and very large, you know, we are not saying for generation that is needed, right, because you're trying to full paper, but for finding whether it's generated or not, you don't always need
yeah. So, you know, our main hypothesis is that all real time business conversations like this are a new surface for attack, and we didn't think of our meetings as even security threat before. So in some sense, it's brand new surface of attack, because it just did. And imagine conservatively, most corporate spend 15% of their time, employees, time in meetings. But the higher up you go in the art shop, that number is very, very high. As you know, how many hours we spend on meetings and how, what percentage of them are hybrid, you know, remote. We feel that it's not only a large market, but it's also growing exponential, right? That's why the timing and our first product.

S Speaker 117:55that's interesting, okay? And so here you are trying to figure out if priyesh is called into this meeting without a video. Then if it is really the audio of priyesh, is that the use case? We do everything. We

S Speaker 418:08use video when available. We can use audio only. And as a matter of fact, if you are a human, you are busy, you don't want to show video, you're just listening in. No problem. We give you your full stack, even an iOS app that you just authenticate using existing technologies seamlessly from the beginning, so we are really a complete engineered solution, and not trying to force technology to solve a problem that is arising from technology the same way, in multiple ways, right, not only algorithmically, but also from a user experience point, right? And also every algorithm is going to fail if you go through a tunnel and don't get sick, what do you do? You just kick them out. No, right? You want to No understand those contacts, right? And be very graceful about how you but at the same time, you want it to be cheap enough that you can constantly be monitoring in the background for millions and millions of people. So we are not, we are not doing, you know? We don't want to just build a high GPU solution that then, you know, basically all the money gets transferred to Nvidia. We want to build business that has scale, you know, margins.

S Speaker 119:42very No, that's where Qualcomm would be interested. Now, is this a large enough so we saw another company in a larger company in a different vertical, called pin drop.
very No, that's where Qualcomm would be interested. Now, is this a large enough so we saw another company in a larger company in a different vertical, called pin drop.

S Speaker 119:56does it for audio, if you're calling into a call center, or, you know, other areas and authenticating your voice footprint for that particular use case. So we did see that, and we were evaluating that for a potential auto use case. Now here a couple of questions for you, and this is probably because we, you know, we live in this siloed world any product that needs to make it into meetings has huge challenges with Microsoft or the guys who control the meeting environment itself. And you know, we were investors in zoom, and we are very proud of them, but we did see challenges coming to them from teams. So is this more for learning how to do this? Or you feel that there's a large enough market here without getting into the incumbent track?

Or you feel that there's a large enough market here without getting into the incumbent track?
S Speaker 420:49Yeah, the incumbent track is real. Our strategy for now is cross all of the top of five, six meeting platforms, okay? Because enterprise, think about B to B, enterprise sale, no security person or CFO is going to say, Okay, fine. Mitigate this risk factor for me in my Zoom meetings, but not in my team speech
Yeah, the incumbent track is real. Our strategy for now is cross all of the top of five, six meeting platforms, okay?

S Speaker 422:57difference is all their IP is around network traffic. They have added some more of this, but that's their core value prop to their core customers, right? And and there are two big kind of what I consider as headwinds for them, which are tiny wins for us, because we're starting now. No, no comment. Which is one is that this new threat maker is not going to look like an anomaly in the telephonic network. It is going to look like a signal. Because if one person is not trying to make 10,000 Raji, is going to 10,000 meetings, somebody is creating one Raji try to come to one meeting. Okay? And that is my difference, right? So that's one biggest. The other thing is, their core value prop is audio as a biometric ID, yes, and our starting point is audio as a biometric ID is dead because the clones are getting so good. Okay, fair point. But you know, I will watch them. I know I have lot of respect for their tech teams. As a matter of fact, I try to hire somebody that they hire, but apparently is not happy. I might have some somehow, this is going on in the background, but I don't have enough money to fight them. You know, I'm still early days, and I don't want to fight them, because I want them to be involved in it. One quick question Varsha and priyesh is, have you heard of this new company effort between Ericsson and 20
difference is all their IP is around network traffic. They have added some more of this, but that's their core value prop to their core customers, right?

S Speaker 424:48follow up, yeah, yeah. So our main question open is, you know, we are going to raise a three round. We have a lost the cafe came from friends and family and strategies. Mostly, you know, we didn't need a large one. We just wanted proof of proof point to get started. My core team, as I mentioned, is me and Mike and Sridhar is also one of my batchmates in IIT, MIT and pre exists, including one in security space, Reshmi, early Google Marketing, Google Maps marketing, early box marketing and urban engines marketing. You may know urban engines, yeah, she Reshmi. Can tell more she was a, you know, early team member and my product and design person, AJ, comes with 20 years of mostly B to B fintech. SAS and has lived in Hong Kong for 10 years. And, you know, studied in UK, is originally Dutch guy who now lives in us. We have a very strong core team, and we are growing a little bit more.

S Speaker 426:02Yeah, he was number four. Before that, he's done a 20 years in finance, and before that, a three time Olympian representing Canada, including the flag bearer in his third Olympics. He's a decade so one of my recruiting recruiting story is, do you want to be coached in the fitness channel by a three time volunteer? So,
Yeah, he was number four. Before that, he's done a 20 years in finance, and before that, a three time Olympian representing Canada, including the flag bearer in his third Olympics.

He's a decade so one of my recruiting recruiting story is, do you want to be coached in the fitness channel by a three time volunteer? So,
S Speaker 626:28so I added the Ericsson, Ericsson document on the chat as well. So
so I added the Ericsson, Ericsson document on the chat as well. So
so I added the Ericsson, Ericsson document on the chat as well. So
so I added the Ericsson, Ericsson document on the chat as well. So
S Speaker 426:31okay, what should take a look at that? So request from you, right? Yeah, I would love to see if you're interested in the seed. And if you want to continue on location, I would love to see if internally, Qualcomm wants to ever try it out with the third party with it, because I really want committed, you know, tests and feedback, because you are kind of eventually my target kind of company. And it can be in a small finance art, right? It can be just in a small accounts receivable, payable art with 50 people, but across two, three countries, or something like that, right? Because I really want committed people to give feedback earlier. So that's okay, yeah, sounds
okay, what should take a look at that? So request from you, right? Yeah, I would love to see if you're interested in the seed. And if you want to continue on location, I would love to see if internally, Qualcomm wants to ever try it out with the third party with it, because I really want committed, you know, tests and feedback, because you are kind of eventually my target kind of company.

Because I really want committed people to give feedback earlier. So that's okay, yeah, sounds
S Speaker 127:10good. Okay. And the third one I'll add, Raji is, as you decide over time, to have a client component to the technology.
