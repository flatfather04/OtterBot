S Speaker 21:19it, I still left it open because there are few people that still negotiation with them. So the safe is still open. We already secured 700k and I'm inclined to add more funds to that, but it's not a major priority for us right now we have focusing on customers.

S Speaker 24:33cool? So since GTC, we have opened registration to invite only users, and it's going well. It's going well, there are already something like 40 something developers that are active, from companies such as Tiktok, Apple and large companies when you're due to work days. Those are for testing the product, and we hope to develop over time, to develop over time, a mechanism to do the penetration, to lend and expand through those use cases. So developer starts the platform, see values, build an agenda, and then their managers, their AI leaders thinking about purchasing a platform for many more AI agents to come. So right now, we're focusing on making sure that we build product that solves the pain point of using multi framework, multi AI agents, multi vendor in one unified platform. We really want to make sure that the platform brings value. So we have every every day we're watching recording of the very items. Yeah, we have onboarding sessions with a few selected one, and we're iterating very fast. We're building with missing features, parts that are not working. So it's going really well. I think that we will lead the guys in the next months on increasing the invites and getting more people on the platform and preparing to the next move. Yeah,

S Speaker 16:31great, great. David, one more reason. I mean, the next time you are raising a bigger round, we would love to evaluate that. But the reason I wanted to have a chat with you today,

6:46sorry for that, yeah
S Speaker 16:47for that, yeah. So the reason I wanted to have you have a chat with you today is that we discussed a Qualcomm partnership opportunity during GTC and recently the mobile team. So Qualcomm launches a lot of chips. Our chips are in mobile devices, Samsung xamy, OPPO and a lot of other leading OEMs, apart from Apple. And at the same time, we have aipc chips, cloud computing chips, XR mobile devices, IoT connectivity, other chips, routers and everything, right? So for the mobile bu team, they are launching their next flagship chip in September end, and they're looking for some partners to work together and have some solutions developed that they can showcase during that launch. This could also lead into a lot of NRE dollars. This could lead in demos across major platforms. This could lead into intros to several OEMs, and having the solution natively being adopted at all the Samsung phones that go out and things like that. So the point that the mobile business unit wants to drive right now is that we can run some of these workloads, AI workloads on the device itself and our chips. They come with NPU, so that's the focus area for them. And I wanted to see if this is of they're looking for some agent tech companies as well. So they have five or six different verticals, Agent Tech game, rendering, AI, guard rails, things like that. And in the AI agent, I just want to check with you if this is something that would be interesting to
for that, yeah. So the reason I wanted to have you have a chat with you today is that we discussed a Qualcomm partnership opportunity during GTC and recently the mobile team.

S Speaker 28:27you. So let me make sure that they got it correctly. You're saying that they're looking for use cases that will allow them to run AI agents on the edge devices. Yeah. How small is the edge device?
you. So let me make sure that they got it correctly. You're saying that they're looking for use cases that will allow them to run AI agents on the edge devices. Yeah. How small is the edge device?

S Speaker 18:39Edge device is the mobile at this point. So Samsung phone, if you can imagine, the flagship, Samsung. Okay,
Edge device is the mobile at this point. So Samsung phone, if you can imagine, the flagship, Samsung. Okay,

Edge device is the mobile at this point. So Samsung phone, if you can imagine, the flagship, Samsung. Okay,
S Speaker 19:21So that's where like they would like inputs from you. So what as the next step? Let me send a small PPT that they have given me right this. This outlines, broadly the timeline, how the partnership could be things like that, and from you. What I'd require is a set of ideas on solutions that you can think of that can run on edge and can make sense both for your business and for Qualcomm, if you will. But just take care, I would say, just think of what would make sense for your roadmap currently, and then I will just pass those ideas to the business units, and have you set up a call with them, that is when you can discuss the entire proposition, how things should go and everything around that.

for sure, for sure, absolutely, I will have to take that, yeah.
S Speaker 112:46So, so let's do that. And even if it does not go anywhere today, maybe down the line when the platform is ready. We have an aipc collaboration or something like that. We can, we can take that up.
So, so let's do that. And even if it does not go anywhere today, maybe down the line when the platform is ready. We have an aipc collaboration or something like that. We can, we can take that up.

S Speaker 212:59Perfect, and the platform model matured since GTC, we released them a few more of the features, very cool features. I can show a few of them. Yeah. So, by the way, you can log in to the platform if you want. Okay,
Perfect, and the platform model matured since GTC, we released them a few more of the features, very cool features. I can show a few of them. Yeah. So, by the way, you can log in to the platform if you want. Okay,

13:20we'll try doing that right after the call.
we'll try doing that right after the call.
we'll try doing that right after the call.
we'll try doing that right after the call.
S Speaker 116:33very interesting, and in case of it fine, if, if it finds any bugs, what? How do you report the errors back to the person,
very interesting, and in case of it fine, if, if it finds any bugs, what? How do you report the errors back to the person,
very interesting, and in case of it fine, if, if it finds any bugs, what? How do you report the errors back to the person,
very interesting, and in case of it fine, if, if it finds any bugs, what? How do you report the errors back to the person,
S Speaker 216:42yeah. So this is the human interfaces. Find the errors. Some errors, nice. So if you are happy with AI items, you can use the Select Board in order to notify users. You can use the web experience so you can bookmark this website now, and you have an AI agent that you have access to, or am I and what can you do? And this AI agent will now sit on a with the with the contacts, with the memory, with tools, everything configured for you so you can just talk to it every day. Or you can use the chat bots, and you can store it on slab, or use MCP and install it on your cursor, or your VS code, any MCP, Native Client, web, SDK, whatever you want, or other agents. Of course,
yeah. So this is the human interfaces. Find the errors. Some errors, nice. So if you are happy with AI items, you can use the Select Board in order to notify users.

S Speaker 117:48very interesting, very interesting, David and you said you have developed a system to get bigger context Windows than what the llms suggest is, is the system still able to process the entire context? Because for some apps that we have seen trying doing that, they miss the context, even if they are able to pass a big chunk of documents through that, but they are not able to reason through the entire context. So how do you make sure you do that? Yeah,

S Speaker 218:18so we, we are a platform of tools. You are not solutions. So we give you the ability to do something like that with something called a genetic so you can specify which items do you want the AI to search as a semantic search inside the payload of the API. So this solution is this tool allows you to build a system that goes to very large context of payloads and exceeding the context field of the AI doesn't lose the context of the AI can follow very significant operations. So you can say, I can try to simulate something like that, like analyze, analyze the last 60 days, levels of,

S Speaker 219:20bowler, and find how many times we got for okay, this query will definitely global flow. AI, yeah, let's see what we're seeing right now. Those two are powered by expanded this is agentic rag. So it's a natural language query that the AI generated, and we will process it alongside the response from the API. So the AI will not get the entire object. It will just get the filtered ones over the last several hours, 10 instances of sample,

S Speaker 120:11that's really cool. Very interesting. David, I'm just thinking the platform is getting better. I would love to try it today, see how, how, what I can build myself, but the platform is continuously getting better. What's the plan to attract developers here? How do you market it? How do you get more people onto the platform? It's a race right now. The there are more agentic platforms coming up. You have to get a way to onboard as many developers as you can as soon as possible.

S Speaker 220:42Yeah. So I'm what we built is way, way, way more advanced than everything, everything that exists in the market right now. Yeah. And I want to be sure that it solves the edge cases of AI, of developers. So this is why we're doing private access right now, right? And we are not charging customers though. We are just focusing hands down on the most challenging use cases that AI agents are now doing. So once we will finish this, I'm going to open, going to release open source, yeah, yeah. Yeah. And I will do open source, and then I will invest the seed money into marketing and PR of that open source and with the templates that will show very advanced use cases in a matter of seconds, right? And that will create some flywheel effect of, okay, I understand expander. I did something very significant for my business, something that wasn't successful until today, for example, we're gonna, we have something ready, and we're gonna release it with Nvidia. We're going to go green light for that. It's going to be on build.nvidia.com, nice. And it's going to be a blueprint that gives you AI agent that records all the meetings on your calendar and does it without the SAS, without SAS subscription, just AI agent. So why won't you use it?
