S Speaker 26:32Yeah, that's and that's okay. We can work with you, and then potentially, like, I don't know when you guys are looking to raise, but when you live to race the next round, we could be, we could, we could work with you guys as well. That's something that I Yeah,
Yeah, that's and that's okay. We can work with you, and then potentially, like, I don't know when you guys are looking to raise, but when you live to race the next round, we could be, we could, we could work with you guys as well. That's something that I Yeah,

S Speaker 16:51it sounds like it's just kind of not a focus at the moment. And so I wouldn't promise that, you know, if we work together that or, you know, do some kind of partnership that there that would guarantee, lead to an investment, or anything, but happy to, you know, explore partnership opportunities nonetheless.

S Speaker 27:14And that's okay too. So then in that case, what will happen Sam is, so what we do is the companies that we work with. So we're the companies that we work with. We ideally want to work towards an investment, and so we'll spend the time, we'll spend the resources of our team to work with you guys, and then lead to a business partnership that will result in revenues on both sides and but if that's not the case, then we touch on it. We spend our resources on it. We'll have timing make an introduction, but we're not going to follow up. I mean, I'm just being we're not going to drive it. It's not an incentive for the team so and and so many perhaps we touch base again when we are ready. Sure, yeah, yeah. It's, it's up to you. I mean, if you think there's a partnership of value, you should discuss with Qualcomm, we can tell you like this, there's interest from our guys to work with captions, but and then we don't. Qualcomm doesn't work with many partners. We only work with a few partners. And we can send you some case studies of partners that we work with, and we've we've actually done really well in terms of partnership and then taking them to customers and and that results in a pipeline of customers. For you guys, if you're looking to expand

Music? Ai, no music. AI is a platform, generative music creation platform, so that works with creators to better generating music. And it's a pretty sizable community, hundreds of 1000s, if not millions, of people using it. And then, so we worked with them to have their models run on mobile and aipc platforms. And then, so, for example, we announced this at SXSW. I was trying to figure out, okay, where this SXSW? And then, so there's an announcement that we made with them. Okay, there it is.
