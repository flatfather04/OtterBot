S Speaker 10:43great. That's great. So I remember I got an introduction from our mutual friend, yes, and I have gone through the deck, but I'd love to know the story from you guys. And I am assuming you guys are raising your pre seed round right now, which is usually a bit early for us, but I'd love to take a look. And possibly, if there is a play we'd like to do that, or, if not, maybe come in again at the next round.

1:13Yeah, sure, absolutely.
Yeah, sure, absolutely.

S Speaker 21:16Yeah. We can talk a little bit ourselves, and maybe you can also introduce a little bit about Hong Kong ventures,
Yeah. We can talk a little bit ourselves, and maybe you can also introduce a little bit about Hong Kong ventures,

S Speaker 23:15decision. Okay, great. Thanks for that. Thanks for the intro. Yeah. So since you you already, you said that you already have our deck, right? I don't remember. Okay, so you already know a little bit of what we are doing. Let me introduce myself, and then as best to Priyesh. So I have studied with ABI in VA and Savi. That's how we know each other. So last year, we graduated from the MBA here, and then I start working together with Priyesh. Since then, previous I was working in Brazil, where I'm from, and I have worked for 10 years in hours in Marcel, which is a consulting company. US consulting company, actually, and basically, I have done like, several types of projects, and have like gone over different departments and different kinds of projects, mostly finance related, but basically a lot of different projects. And then I decided to transition to my career, and I wanted to start something, yeah, so decided to do my MBA, which was great, because also very known for for having startups, and they have their own incubator accelerator, so he kind of like spark a bunch of ideas. And Priyesh was here living in Madurai as well at the time, and we are longtime friends. We met 10 years ago in Singapore, like studying abroad in university, and we got back together after many years, and started talking about ideas, and that's how we got started on
decision. Okay, great. Thanks for that. Thanks for the intro. Yeah. So since you you already, you said that you already have our deck, right? I don't remember.

S Speaker 38:22to go over? Joe, yeah, or we can just kind of quickly run through it. But internal applications are a massive spend, a massive reason for spend, for companies to spend 100 and $50 billion per year, and I can attest to this, that the tech team spend 33% of their time developing and maintaining custom internal tools and bigger companies, that's even more. And as you see here, that goes up to 50 when you're dealing with larger companies. And that's really where,
to go over? Joe, yeah, or we can just kind of quickly run through it.

8:55that's where we really have
that's where we really have
that's where we really have
that's where we really have
S Speaker 38:58our core problem. The core problem is the fact that custom drop in remains the bottom. It's not Tech's fault. It's not businesses fault. It's just that when business has a ton of needs and tech is overwhelmed, right? So if you see the pipeline that things that projects have to go through, you're looking at backlogs being 12 months long. You're looking at projects taking a four and a half months on average, to build by the tech team, and what that really means for enterprises is they're slow to change, and every decision that they make in terms of where they allocate their resources has tons and tons of implications, because there's a massive opportunity cost that they're constantly dealing with and having to balance the needs while also factoring in their governance and strategy and overall kind of long term thinking that they have. They are really forced to, kind of constantly make compromises, either to make tech happy or business happy or enterprises happy. And what we really want to do is kind of address that at its core.

S Speaker 39:57So if you look at kind of just the world right now, right? Let's take out AI for a second. If you look at a spectrum of how technical the user, the end user, needs to be, and how custom or rebuilt, the solution ends up being. On the left you have the no code players, traditional no code who basically their whole promise is, hey, you can build anything right, drag and drop. It's WYSIWYG. You can you can press a few buttons and you catch one at the end of the day. That's great for non technical but you are limited to the templates that they offer. Yep, maybe some cases, for sure, no code is awesome. We're not here to disparage no code in any way, but you're limited in terms of the use cases they can actually solve, or you have to double down and do it the bubble way, with tons of hacks and tons of integrations that you create. And then if you take a step back and you look at it, it's like, I have built a mess, no code, but it's a mess. Low code is the next one, which is kind of trying to go after a little bit what I'm saying, where you can write your own code, you can integrate a lot of this problem that I mentioned, of double like having to kind of you end up spending too much time or getting too much experience or expertise in the retool way of doing things. And as a tech guy, I can tell you low code net is never easier than building it yourself. So at some point you're kind of stuck in this trap of your app. You're stuck doing it the retool way, and you need developer support, and you need business to tell you what you want, which is basically a traditional software development so what AI is really kind of bringing into the world today is tackling that problem a little bit. So on the bottom right, you have something that is truly custom and going after technical users, which is the CO pilots. They're the ones that are being in the news today, but at the end of the day, they're going after me, the developer, right, not Felipe, the business user. And what we want to do, and where we see a clear opportunity with not as much maturation in this in this space, is in that top right where we want to go after the non technical users, but also offer custom software in ways that their tech team would. We're really trying to bridge that gap that exists between if you look at the two opposites of the spectrum, which is no code and CO pilots, we're trying to bring those two together. It's no code for the end for the end user, and it's code for the actual developers who will integrate or inherit the project. Okay,
So if you look at kind of just the world right now, right? Let's take out AI for a second.

There you go. Okay, you guys can see it, right? Yeah,
S Speaker 212:51okay, so, yeah, just to call out here that basically we have, it's a prototype. We call it our internal tool, because as big what we are using for our own development, right? So this is not yet focusing on the interface with the end user, as we know that in this stage that we are, we still, we still like going through our first conversation with the clients and looking for the right pilot to get started. And that pilot, for sure, will be through us managing our two in the first client. And then this is why you're going to see the interface, not there yet in terms of front end, but here you can see already the capabilities that we have built and basically the whole flow, how it plays out. Sorry. Okay.
okay, so, yeah, just to call out here that basically we have, it's a prototype. We call it our internal tool, because as big what we are using for our own development, right?

Sorry. Okay.
S Speaker 314:29once we can just pause it for one second, just one thing to call out before that, one of the things that we think we have cracked from a capability perspective, from just like being able to do something like this, we really think it's as much as it is writing the code. It's figuring out what kind of code to write. And I can attest to this as when I'm working with consultant, working with this consulting, or working with clients, the more clarity that the client has on what they want to build, the better the product that they end up getting. Yeah, and that's really what we like. So we look at three pillars, which is requirements, gathering, planning, and then the development. We really have spent a lot of time kind of fine tuning and optimizing for that the first two players. And we want to make it clear that this is where we rely on the user to give us the context. And with that being said, I have tons of experience where clients don't know what they want, or they think they want one thing and they really want something else. So this process is built to kind of flush that out of you, either if you don't, if you know it and can't verbalize it, which is a lot of non technical people, or if you just don't know it, but you have that overall vision of what you're trying to build. Both of those are okay, because our agents flush out the the scope of the project, just by you talking through and so we cover around
once we can just pause it for one second, just one thing to call out before that, one of the things that we think we have cracked from a capability perspective, from just like being able to do something like this, we really think it's as much as it is writing the code. It's figuring out what kind of code to write. And I can attest to this as when I'm working with consultant, working with this consulting, or working with clients, the more clarity that the client has on what they want to build, the better the product that they end up getting. Yeah, and that's really what we like. So we look at three pillars, which is requirements, gathering, planning, and then the development. We really have spent a lot of time kind of fine tuning and optimizing for that the first two players. And we want to make it clear that this is where we rely on the user to give us the context.

So we basically the system is intelligent enough where if you start off with saying, I am a and I am a business manager working for this company, and I want this, then we don't ask you the stakeholders, for example, because we know that you're in that conversation, or that dimension has been covered, yeah, different part of the conversation.

S Speaker 216:35yeah. So here, yeah. So basically that, that whole flow takes like 30 to 40 minutes, of course, depending on how complex is the project. So you're just sticking to the part of the actual development, project planning and development. So here basically, is the way that we are using that we put the project plan already into the import page, and isn't that

So from this point onward, the automation really kicks in, while there is ways for the user to continue, kind of refining anything. Our goal here, by now is all the thinking has been so now our planning agents come and kind of do the project plan in a very traditional way that you see project plans today, but a little bit more optimized for AI. So in the from a planning perspective, we want to accomplish two things. One is do the things that you you are used to. Your tech team is used to doing, while at the same time, also kind of tweaking it a little so that AI can shine. And that's really where the planning is magical. But at the end of the day, we're replacing or replicating the existing way of doing things, with brands, user stories, milestones and all of that, but it's been kind of hyper optimized for the AI.

S Speaker 318:40Yeah. So we break it down into milestones, sprints, user stories, tasks, and then sub tests, and that's the five level of task decomposition that we do. But then for each of those, we go down one level in terms of granularity, and then obviously the secret sauce kicks in when the development happens. But from a planning perspective, it's really just organizing the massive amount of information that we have captured in a way that and there's layers to this, some technical, some AI related, for example, you can't develop any you can't develop the front end before the API is done. So in our planning, we have to kind of account for any dependencies that might happen and structure which is something that a project manager does for a living. What we're trying to do is kind of replicate
Yeah. So we break it down into milestones, sprints, user stories, tasks, and then sub tests, and that's the five level of task decomposition that we do.

S Speaker 319:42Then if you start seeing, I think, from a for users perspective, I think this is where we stop. You're going to see some secret subtasks and test regeneration, some of the stuff that we do behind the scenes. Just keep in mind, like what the user sees is going to be a little bit different, a little bit more contextual for them. But right now where we have a working prototype, and we're just trying to get that as solid as possible before we apply the skin or the UI on top of it. Got it all right. And nothing you're seeing, I'm just seeing because of the demo, and I'm sure you've seen this board, nothing you're seeing here this week. This is all generated. Just see some ugly buttons along the way. But everything here, from a capability perspective, is real,

S Speaker 320:27No, it is a personal pet peeve that I want it to look good, but at the same time, you see here, this is the actual magic. Let's call it this, the actual development that is taking place. So subtask by subtask, task by task, sprint by sprint, the development will go. We're pressing the buttons right now because for the demo, we don't want to observe it just run wild. But there would actually be no buttons. It would be an automated way. But you see here it's writing the code. It's writing writing the actual test cases, the actual so you see the code being updated in the workstation over there. And then once this is done, this takes three to four minutes per sub test, depending on some of the subjects take a little bit longer because it's more complex. But you'll see the test cases get written, test actual like a test suite running. And then you'll see the developers, the engineering team come in, write the code against the test cases, and then you'll see a PR being created. As you see here, there's actual

S Speaker 321:32and there's another set of tests that run behind the scenes to make sure that it is working. So you probably know this better than anybody, but a lot of the things that we are doing is just redundancy, right? Like making an airplane fly is not that hard. Making an airplane fly reliably every single time with no accidents is a whole different thing, right? That's where the redundancies come in. That's where the overhead of doing it the right way comes in. And that's really what you're seeing from from our perspective, is like a Devon, or you look at any of these, like just getting a simple Hello World up and running using code is one thing, you know, artifacts or any of those. But that's not the real world. And for the real world, there's a lot of innovation that had to happen, but there's also a lot of redundancies and a lot of checks and balances that we've had to put in place. And that's where we really think the power of AI one shot prompting, or one shot is not the future. Of course, chat GPT might not agree with that. There they have billions of dollars invested in but let's try to get to one shot prompting. But we are not relying on nor do we need chat GPT to be any better than it is today, because we have enough of that built in ourselves.

S Speaker 323:00it needs to be eight, 910, because and then obviously there's a lot of caching we can build in, and that cuts it by like, there's a lot of things that we can still do. I think we're just scratching the surface, yeah, but right now, if you just let it run in a very unoptimized way, we're looking at three to four hours, probably longer, depending on the complex
it needs to be eight, 910, because and then obviously there's a lot of caching we can build in, and that cuts it by like, there's a lot of things that we can still do.

S Speaker 323:24you know? So we have feedback in the sense of, once the actual project is getting built, we can have feedbacks, but we really believe in iterations. So right now, why do you need feedback? Is because the cost of development is so high you want to catch it early and get your point across so that the developer doesn't go build something you don't want. But now, if you're talking about an hour that you waste, because you might not have like, Let's build a version two, let's build a version three. And you know that your version three is going to be better, because this is an opportunity that humans cannot provide. Right within the same day, you could be by version three already that we kind of looked at, we had so many debates and conversations about how much humans should be in the loop. And we really kind of agreed on it's better to put more products out there and more iterations out there, and that's where the human will really contribute

S Speaker 124:16now, typically, as an investor, I would come across a lot of these projects which are late in the state. So usually, the customer feedback would speak if the workflows are working for the customers or not. In this case, I am a little bit intrigued. Who do you think you guys are competing with? There are a lot of AI native specific applications, let's say for a lead generation project, if we were creating one. Why do you think a custom built lead generation, internally developed tool would win against one of those

S Speaker 325:38Larry. Yeah, so to your question, or to your point, I think absolutely what you're saying is true for smaller companies, SaaS is always going to be better, right? Because SaaS is specialized, or that's what you need, is a small little thing where we see our kind of sweet spot is as the companies get bigger, the problems are much more complex and just a little bit different than what SaaS provides, right? And that little bit is a constant conversation between enterprises of do we double down on doing it in the SaaS way and how we have subscription costs? Now, if we go from 500 to 1000 people, your subscription just doubled for the year, right? So you're really looking at that sweet spot of when they outgrow SaaS for a variety of reasons, right? It could be because of subscription costs. It could be data privacy. That's another huge one that our customers have consistently or pilot customers that we've talked to have consistently told us that they are not a fan of retool having all of my leads data. They want it to be in house, right? Or they want it to be controlled by them. So we're kind of doing is bridging both of those worlds. And if you look at the larger companies, they're already doing that, right? Of course, that plays a role in the big companies, but 10,000 plus companies are typically already building internal tools internally. So where we're looking at our sweet spot is essentially giving access to these mid level companies, giving them access to mature enterprise level processes, without necessarily having to front the costs that come with enterprise level processes today, because humans are involved.

S Speaker 127:22That's that's interesting, graduate, and that makes sense. I think my national next question would be, how are you planning to price this? Because you develop a SaaS once. Is this a usage based pricing? Would it be? I? Would it be a seed based pricing? How are you thinking about that?
That's that's interesting, graduate, and that makes sense. I think my national next question would be, how are you planning to price this? Because you develop a SaaS once. Is this a usage based pricing? Would it be? I? Would it be a seed based pricing? How are you thinking about that?

S Speaker 227:53I mean, we are very early stage to actually have a clear and definitive answer for this question. But the idea here that what we have is kind of like a subscription package, you know? So basically, you hire us to be almost your tech AI tech team, let's say, right. So you have a bunch of demands inside the company, and you can use our platform user base, but with certain limits, of course, in terms of developments and iterations that you have, and where the power comes is the version right? That Priyesh mentioned earlier is that you can create these platforms in several versions, right? Instead of creating one platform and that's it, then you have it, and you go home, you also you're gonna start creating version by version, and that's how you are actually going to use our platform more recurrently. That way.

And the flip side of looking at that is the world right now, and something really Nadella just said this in one of his interviews recently, but like, crud runs the world. I don't know if you know what crud is, but it's like, create, read, update and delete. It runs the world. So if you look at the majority of the applications that are being built out there, they're just complex integrations, but they're integrations at the end of the day, directly with the database, showing the data, manipulating the data. And that's really where we think initially we are going to make a kill. Are we going to is Tesla going to your SpaceX? Going to use our product to put a guy on the moon? Probably not. But are we going to build just admin, like a bunch of admin dashboards, a bunch of CRM, CMS? That's where we really look at, kind of our sweet spot initially, obviously, the world is changing rapidly, but for the short to medium term future, we're, we're confident that it's going to be those kinds of products

So are we like, if you look at landing pages, Wix versus what we can do, or SquareSpace versus what we can do is relatively limited, right? And like that, there's a clear advantage that Squarespace would have in our space, and there's no real reason for a company to bring in us in this space. Look at the core product on the top right. That's where you want to hire some engineers. That's where you want to build out your internal teams.

S Speaker 231:43Okay? So we did some, we did a lot of conversations to potential clients, and based on those conversations, and based on the kind of, let's say, the kind of offerings that they are nowadays, right? Because before you, you made a question about who are actually our competitors, right? And who do we see as our competitors right now? Our basically agencies, right, third party services that companies don't hire to develop specifically applications that they right? Yeah. And when we look at those and compare to the kind of solutions that we are offering, I would say that we are in a ballpark of minimum, at 25k per year, that would be like the minimum. We are definitely that median to large, our size B to B kind of startup, right? That's where, where we see that's
Okay? So we did some, we did a lot of conversations to potential clients, and based on those conversations, and based on the kind of, let's say, the kind of offerings that they are nowadays, right?

S Speaker 132:35interesting. And I definitely see a lot of land and expand motion in this kind of workplace. So that makes sense. And like you mentioned in one of the previous slide, the ideal customer profile would be companies which have somewhere but 500 plus employees, roughly speaking, ideally, not initially, yeah,

S Speaker 332:56but I think initially we're gonna have to kind of so no one has said no to give me like the free code or cheap code, or what we're offering right at the end of the day, what we're offering is pretty great. So no one has come out and said no, I don't want I think we have a unique opportunity today, and this is what we've been going through for the last month, is just kind of talking to different customers, like yesterday, for a couple of days, we were talking to a customer who runs like 2530 daycares, they have, like a franchise model, and so it relatively fits a lot of this criteria, but they don't have a tech team. So for us, fits 80 or eight out of the 10 criteria. Let's say that we have but if they don't have a tech team, then we are going to end up playing an agency role, whether we like it or not, right? And that is not a good use of our time, because we are trying to learn about our platform. Not trying to get what databases set up or API set up like. So what we want to do is kind of whittle down some of the short list, some of the potential customers that we have, and pick one or two pilots from that that allow us to learn about the actual platform itself,

S Speaker 134:03interesting. And where are you in that process right now? Guys, have you identified your pilot customers? How do you think that looks like? What would be the project milestones from here on?
interesting. And where are you in that process right now? Guys, have you identified your pilot customers? How do you think that looks like? What would be the project milestones from here on?

34:17Yeah, so we definitely have
Yeah, so we definitely have
Yeah, so we definitely have
Yeah, so we definitely have
S Speaker 334:20like, three or four that have passed that initial round of interest and good conversations, they're really interesting from a project perspective, for us to learn and from them to use us. So our goal is, in the next month, to close one of those, or one or two of those, depending on our bandwidth, and essentially start building that out in parallel. And this is the conversation that we're having. We're we want to, like Felipe mentioned, our pilot customers, we are going to be the primary users of our platform. They all talk to us. We'll use our platform, get it built according to them, and kind of still be the human in the loop in that process, just because it's a pilot. But what we want to do in parallel is to build out and raise money and then kind of build out our development team in India, and really kind of make this into an actual product instead of a service.

That's very interesting.
S Speaker 135:17So I know we are about time. I do have to run at I have another call at 940 but a couple of very quick questions. So you're raising a small round round right now, which is about $1.2 million it fits right in our thesis. And I'm very exciting. It's also very exciting. The problem is our check sizes are usually somewhere between three to 10, and our sweet spot is five to seven. So it's it seems like a round early for us. How is the raising going on right now? Have you guys identified a few commitments? How is that process looking like?
