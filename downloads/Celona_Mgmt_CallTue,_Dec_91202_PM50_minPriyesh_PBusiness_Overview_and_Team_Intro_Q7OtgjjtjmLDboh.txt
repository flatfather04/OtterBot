S Speaker 11:59All right, so let me, let me just kick it off. I mean, I think for most of you are probably familiar with the idea behind salona is always, you know, how do we use private 5g to really define the wireless platform for most of industrial enterprise, where we saw, you know, seven years back, kind of this wave of automation coming in, I think in the last couple of years, that application level has gotten a little more focus as we have kind of come up with a more generic term called physical AI, and we absolutely see that happening in all our customers. And the second kind of core theory behind salua was to kind of take cellular and bring it to the enterprise. You needed the best of both of those worlds. You needed to understand enterprise networking and infrastructure and go to market, try and also understand cellular at a deep level. And so the team actually that has been here pretty much for most of this time. The first four of us are the founders who started the company in 19 Puneet joined us within a couple of years and has grown through the ranks. All of us come from one of those two worlds. You know me, Vina Ravi we were all early engineers at Aruba Mehmet, obviously many of you might know from his many years at Qualcomm, and this has been a core thesis for us now. GWEN briefly touched upon it. This management team was a lot bigger till about two or three months back when we were going through our growth phase, we had added a really seasoned CFO we had added is really seasoned SVP of engineering, SVP of sales, and as I'll describe a little more, during the cost reduction efforts, we have had to part ways with them, but the core team is still in place, And lot of us have stepped up. I mean, Vinay has stepped up to lead engineering in place of the SVB of engineering. Vineet has stepped up to take on an expanded role out of just product and to take on all of field engineering and service delivery and so on. So good to see that the core team is still in place, and honestly, the mission has not changed. What we continue to believe, what we continue to see in the market is at a product and technology level, there's really four technical challenges that customers are having when they're trying to solve these connectivity issues in their world number one is in a lot of our environments, coverage is a big issue because of the just the size of these facilities. So you think of refineries, you think of large transportation yards. It's just not possible to cover it with Wi Fi. So the standard example I give is a lot of these refineries, they would need 1000, 1200 Wi Fi access points to even cover them. And we will typically cover them with like 10 to 12 and to forget the cost of the actual equipment, it's usually physically not possible to cover these areas. The second major thing is, you know, Wi Fi doesn't handle moving devices very well, so more there are robotics and AGVs and AMRs in these facilities, the more that gets exposed. So problem that's been known for a long time, but what has changed in the last three to four years is this is no longer restricted to just Amazon using it in their warehouses. Pretty much every manufacturing company, every logistics company, every retail company, everybody has AGVs and AMRs in their facility. And therefore this has become a bigger problem in the industry. And then the third is from a pure reliability perspective, if you start to really run kind of mission critical workloads, whether it's robotics or even PLCs on this network, then you need a higher level of reliability than you would need. You know Wi Fi is works fine if you're doing email and web based apps, because you could lose connectivity for a couple of seconds. And honestly, none of it. But that is not acceptable when you get to that level of automation, and across all these scenarios, you know, when you go away from user based access to really things and machines, security has always been a Achilles heel in Wi Fi, and that's one, the fourth major driver across industry that's driving people to private Priyesh. So when we started the company seven years back, this was theory as recent as 21 when we came out of covid, this was still a theory that we believed in. I think the good news for us is, in the last three to three and a half years, that has been well proven in the market. So one of the things that we are very happy about, despite all the challenges, is the customer base that we have put together in the last three and a half years is really the who's who of like the industrial enterprise in the US and Europe and most of these, I would say we have acquired in the last 18 to 24 months. When you think of these large manufacturing companies, they tend to think of adoption of new technology and three to five year cycles, not in one to two year cycles. And so that, I think has worked out quite well. The other thing that I'm pretty happy about to go to market is we really are very focused in who we are targeting. We have a very clear definition of our ICP. It is really just three types of environments that we focus on, its refineries, its manufacturing plants and its warehouses and yards. Now those three environments exist in petrochemical companies, oil and gas companies, warehouses and yards exist in retail companies. They exist in transportation companies. But essentially, the commonality is you have those three environments where we repeatedly find the same problem statement, similar solutions, similar parts to the market, similar business models, and it's a nice, repeatable motion. So I think that part has worked really well. The last element I'll say here is a very large number of the big customers here actually started with more often than not, Nokia. They actually deployed their first one or two sites with Nokia, and that is when the pain point of going with a non enterprise vendor and a telco vendor became very apparent, and then they have shifted over. So the number of large fortune, 500 customers that we have taken away from Nokia is actually pretty impressive in this list. Lionel went to Nokia. First celinese went to Nokia. First nutrient went to snokia. First marathon went to Nokia.
All right, so let me, let me just kick it off.

First nutrient went to snokia. First marathon went to Nokia.
S Speaker 19:08First Penske tried Nokia. Eurosels, surely J and J, yes. Cargill, yes. Nestle, yes. So there's a repeated theme where the competitive advantage that we have is repeatedly proven, not just in like Bay Cox, but by large customers who have tried this at scale and failed to do it with Nokia, when I've come to us, right? So having all of those things worked out quite well, the biggest challenge we ran into, quite honestly, this year. And maybe I should say this, as you know, we last year on the kind of momentum that we were starting to see in this customer traction for pretty much the first time, from 22 from calendar year, 22 from first time last year, we significantly increased our sales team. We almost doubled our sales team because we had just acquired many of these customers. In that period, we were starting to have conversations about the rollouts, and so we expanded our sales team to go make advantage of that, especially given the win rate we were having against Nokia. And the big thing that happened this year for us is really that the uncertainty caused by the tariffs essentially put almost a big pause on the deployment plans for pretty much all of these customers. And when we talk to each of them, all of almost universally, their feedback was, we're not changing strategically anything we are doing, but till we have certainty on where the tariffs land, we just don't know what is the budget we have. And so literally, from March to October, we had almost a stencil in most of the deployments for these customers. And it's only in the last two months that we have started see them pick up again. So that was a very significant impact, and you can see it very clearly when you look at the financial charts. So I'll just walk you through. The business is primarily run on TCV. Our business model is typically a three or a five year subscription. Most customers do three years right now, and we collect the cash up front, the hardware part of that gets recognized up front, which is about 35 to 40% and the software subscription feeds, Arr, okay. And as you can see, in those three years, you know, our fiscal year ends in January. So fiscal year 23 is mostly calendar year 22 if you can see calendar year 22 calendar year 22 three to 24 which is really this jam, we were practically doubling every year. And this is what the momentum that excited us to grow our sales base. And this is really that impact of just the orders completely coming to a standstill as the deployments became slowed down. Really nothing else slowed down. I mean, at a slightly slower pace, we were still acquiring new customers, including new fortune, 1000 2000 customers, but the deployment schedule just literally ground to a halt. That I think is the big story here. Unfortunately, this came at a time when we had a second impact on our business, which is our supply chain, got significantly impacted, partially due to tariffs, because we had one of our products coming from Vietnam that we had to move to a different contract manufacturer in Taiwan. And second, because Foxconn, who was our CM, decided to get out of the entire small cell manufacturing game altogether, and so we had to essentially find a full replacement for them. And all of that replacement happened at the same time when this was happening. So the combination of that meant, you know, we had incoming cash inflow slow down significantly, while our outgoing costs on NRE to move to this hardware, to a new guy, licensing all that stuff that happens happened at the same time, and we were also, unfortunately, till we took some actions in June, and then again in September, also having a payroll that was the increased sales force, so we almost had, like a triple whammy that really impacted our liquidity. Let me just pause there, because I think this is a critical part of where we start finding ourselves. Yeah.
First Penske tried Nokia. Eurosels, surely J and J, yes. Cargill, yes. Nestle, yes.

Really nothing else slowed down. I mean, at a slightly slower pace, we were still acquiring new customers, including new fortune, 1000 2000 customers, but the deployment schedule just literally ground to a halt. That I think is the big story here. Unfortunately, this came at a time when we had a second impact on our business, which is our supply chain, got significantly impacted, partially due to tariffs, because we had one of our products coming from Vietnam that we had to move to a different contract manufacturer in Taiwan. And second, because Foxconn, who was our CM, decided to get out of the entire small cell manufacturing game altogether, and so we had to essentially find a full replacement for them. And all of that replacement happened at the same time when this was happening. So the combination of that meant, you know, we had incoming cash inflow slow down significantly, while our outgoing costs on NRE to move to this hardware, to a new guy, licensing all that stuff that happens happened at the same time, and we were also, unfortunately, till we took some actions in June, and then again in September, also having a payroll that was the increased sales force, so we almost had, like a triple whammy that really impacted our liquidity. Let me just pause there, because I think this is a critical part of where we start finding ourselves. Yeah.
First Penske tried Nokia. Eurosels, surely J and J, yes. Cargill, yes. Nestle, yes. So there's a repeated theme where the competitive advantage that we have is repeatedly proven, not just in like Bay Cox, but by large customers who have tried this at scale and failed to do it with Nokia, when I've come to us, right? So having all of those things worked out quite well, the biggest challenge we ran into, quite honestly, this year. And maybe I should say this, as you know, we last year on the kind of momentum that we were starting to see in this customer traction for pretty much the first time, from 22 from calendar year, 22 from first time last year, we significantly increased our sales team. We almost doubled our sales team because we had just acquired many of these customers. In that period, we were starting to have conversations about the rollouts, and so we expanded our sales team to go make advantage of that, especially given the win rate we were having against Nokia. And the big thing that happened this year for us is really that the uncertainty caused by the tariffs essentially put almost a big pause on the deployment plans for pretty much all of these customers. And when we talk to each of them, all of almost universally, their feedback was, we're not changing strategically anything we are doing, but till we have certainty on where the tariffs land, we just don't know what is the budget we have. And so literally, from March to October, we had almost a stencil in most of the deployments for these customers. And it's only in the last two months that we have started see them pick up again. So that was a very significant impact, and you can see it very clearly when you look at the financial charts. So I'll just walk you through. The business is primarily run on TCV. Our business model is typically a three or a five year subscription. Most customers do three years right now, and we collect the cash up front, the hardware part of that gets recognized up front, which is about 35 to 40% and the software subscription feeds, Arr, okay. And as you can see, in those three years, you know, our fiscal year ends in January. So fiscal year 23 is mostly calendar year 22 if you can see calendar year 22 calendar year 22 three to 24 which is really this jam, we were practically doubling every year. And this is what the momentum that excited us to grow our sales base. And this is really that impact of just the orders completely coming to a standstill as the deployments became slowed down.

S Speaker 214:09The customer deployment slowed down drastically this year, right? But what about were there any customers decided just gonna not do it at all is there like churn, if you will, or you haven't seen any,

The customer deployment slowed down drastically this year, right? But what about were there any customers decided just gonna not do it at all is there like churn, if you will, or you haven't seen any,
S Speaker 114:24we have had zero churn. Nobody's decided to go even to Wi Fi, even that's not happened. It's not like people have said, Oh, we won't do private 5g we'll do Wi Fi. We have surely not had any competitive churn at all. It's just that they basically postpone their deployment plans, which are inevitably tied to some degree of modernization or automation, right? So, I mean, I'll give you a couple of concrete examples, J and J, you know, they basically went through about a 24 month period to pick a vendor, and they picked us last December, and they were planning to deploy private in four plans this year, when the tariffs hit, because pharma was so impacted, they essentially decided, till we have clarity on that, we are going to do nothing, because we have To decide if we might need to even commit to building a brand new plant in the US, and that's a whole degree of investment. So then we might not invest in our existing German plants and so on. Now, finally, when the tariffs did settle, they made a deal with the administration. Now they deployed their first full plant, and so we got the PO for it in October, November. So that is a pattern. I mean, literally, BP was very similar. They had at the beginning of the year, 4 million in budget to do this on multiple sites. Once the oil prices dropped very significantly, they put a full pause. They actually had major layoffs. They stopped, and now again they are essentially they just deployed one site, second site coming in Jan, Feb. Third site now pushed out to June. So everything just moved. Nothing went away. Everything just moved by six to nine months, and
we have had zero churn. Nobody's decided to go even to Wi Fi, even that's not happened. It's not like people have said, Oh, we won't do private 5g we'll do Wi Fi.

S Speaker 216:16now that maybe the tariff thing is kind of subside a little bit. Yeah, you see the deployment starts happening. I mean, you talked about j&j Looks like they're happening. But is it? Is it other across board, you see that happening? Or is still slow?
now that maybe the tariff thing is kind of subside a little bit. Yeah, you see the deployment starts happening. I mean, you talked about j&j Looks like they're happening. But is it? Is it other across board, you see that happening? Or is still slow?

S Speaker 116:32It is across the board starting to happen, but it is clearly lost the you know, the scale is going to be stretched out more, right? So everyone's the fundamental issue is everybody's budgeting cycle. When you September, October, when they close, then they only have three months in this year's budgeting cycle. So everything got pushed to saying, Okay, now let's evaluate budgets for next year. So we are seeing it happen, but it's not recovered all the way in terms of, we didn't recover all of it immediately, but
It is across the board starting to happen, but it is clearly lost the you know, the scale is going to be stretched out more, right? So everyone's the fundamental issue is everybody's budgeting cycle.

S Speaker 217:07it's here to think about q1 this coming quarter, right? Yeah, you think things will continue to pick up, or still going to be somewhat slow.
it's here to think about q1 this coming quarter, right? Yeah, you think things will continue to pick up, or still going to be somewhat slow.

it's here to think about q1 this coming quarter, right? Yeah, you think things will continue to pick up, or still going to be somewhat slow.
S Speaker 117:16I think it'll pick up, but quite honestly, from a different base, and obviously we now have a very different size sales team, so that is going to significantly impact it too, right? I think our sales team, with the cost reduction that I'll cover in a bit, is nearly 1/3 of what it was before this. So that will certainly impact us. But the existing install based customers, we are certainly starting to see them pick up like Eaton is going to put in into two new plants. Cargill is rolling it out across 10 to 20 sites every quarter now. So I do see the momentum slowly returning, but I think we'll still, you know, take a while before we get to the growth level we were originally targeting. Okay?
I think it'll pick up, but quite honestly, from a different base, and obviously we now have a very different size sales team, so that is going to significantly impact it too, right?

S Speaker 318:04Any question, yeah, just a quick question on the fi, 26 so look at most of the contracts are like three years roughly. Do you see
Any question, yeah, just a quick question on the fi, 26 so look at most of the contracts are like three years roughly. Do you see
Any question, yeah, just a quick question on the fi, 26 so look at most of the contracts are like three years roughly. Do you see
Any question, yeah, just a quick question on the fi, 26 so look at most of the contracts are like three years roughly. Do you see
S Speaker 318:187 million that I see there? How much is new and how much is renewable?
7 million that I see there? How much is new and how much is renewable?
7 million that I see there? How much is new and how much is renewable?
7 million that I see there? How much is new and how much is renewable?
S Speaker 118:23Out of the 7.3 how much is new land versus expand? Is that the question?

Out of the 7.3 how much is new land versus expand? Is that the question?
Out of the 7.3 how much is new land versus expand? Is that the question?
S Speaker 318:28Yeah, renewal of the of the of the contract.
Yeah, renewal of the of the of the contract.
Yeah, renewal of the of the of the contract.
Yeah, renewal of the of the of the contract.
S Speaker 118:31Yeah, renewal is pretty small because, you know, we only had this small little base that was coming up for renewal, about half of this, so it's not a lot of renewals, is barely one to 2% honestly. But from a land and expand perspective, install base customers who are adding new sites is still probably, I'll check the exact number, but it's easily 60 to 65% right now, in that the new, brand new customers buying their first site. Is a relatively small amount here in this
Yeah, renewal is pretty small because, you know, we only had this small little base that was coming up for renewal, about half of this, so it's not a lot of renewals, is barely one to 2% honestly.

S Speaker 319:07on the renewal, because that like roughly 30, 40% is hardware of the TCD. Do they get new hardware too after the after the expiration or hardware remains,

S Speaker 119:18if they just do a renewal, then they use the same hardware, and if they buy a brand new three or five year subscription, then we get new hard.

S Speaker 219:29So, just so you understand, David, this is a total contract. So basically contract signed in FY 25 which was last year. Now a lot of these positive the deployment is supposed to happen this year, I see, and next year and next year, Okay, makes sense. But the deployment is not happening, right? That's the issue. And then also the new order is also slowing down, right? The TCV, the new bookings, yeah, okay, instead of, like, bookings,
So, just so you understand, David, this is a total contract. So basically contract signed in FY 25 which was last year.

19:55TCP, yeah, exactly.
S Speaker 120:00And I think I've just summarized most of today's discussion, but when we think of you know what's working is, I do think we keep getting great customers. I think our competitive win rate is great. Our pipeline is actually really, really healthy. There's still a lot of significant size opportunities there. However we are going through this period, like I said, around this tariff uncertainty, that's really slowed it down. There is, there is a little bit of still. This is still, think of this as first generation of private 5g getting deployed in enterprises. So that always has friction, because people are not trained, partners are not trained. So everything takes a little longer than we wanted, but if you put all of that is baked into our original plan. So what changed is really this macroeconomic stuff that really impacted us. I do think what we are doing now is the right thing, which is, with our reduced cost structure, from a go to market perspective, we are really focusing on a lot, on our install base and the adjacent markets. I think we can get back a lot of growth by that focus. Because earlier the expansion to try to double the business again, we were trying to take on a lot, both in terms of new customers, partners and geography. So it's going to be a lot more focused by this next coming fab in the next two months, most of the supply chain transition will be complete as well. I do think that is very significant. And quite honestly, foxcon, our terms were terrible, this is going to be a lot more friendlier from a cash flow perspective as well. So I think we will come out better on the other side with a year of pain behind us.
And I think I've just summarized most of today's discussion, but when we think of you know what's working is, I do think we keep getting great customers. I think our competitive win rate is great.

This is still, think of this as first generation of private 5g getting deployed in enterprises. So that always has friction, because people are not trained, partners are not trained. So everything takes a little longer than we wanted, but if you put all of that is baked into our original plan. So what changed is really this macroeconomic stuff that really impacted us. I do think what we are doing now is the right thing, which is, with our reduced cost structure, from a go to market perspective, we are really focusing on a lot, on our install base and the adjacent markets. I think we can get back a lot of growth by that focus. Because earlier the expansion to try to double the business again, we were trying to take on a lot, both in terms of new customers, partners and geography. So it's going to be a lot more focused by this next coming fab in the next two months, most of the supply chain transition will be complete as well. I do think that is very significant. And quite honestly, foxcon, our terms were terrible, this is going to be a lot more friendlier from a cash flow perspective as well. So I think we will come out better on the other side with a year of pain behind us.
And I think I've just summarized most of today's discussion, but when we think of you know what's working is, I do think we keep getting great customers. I think our competitive win rate is great. Our pipeline is actually really, really healthy. There's still a lot of significant size opportunities there.

You know, is it 100% unlocked Samsung device? Does it look for CBRs appropriately? Is the sim properly set up for the exact PLM and ID that a private networks uses. How is it across countries, Apple has absolutely nailed it. Apple products work flawlessly. All non Apple products are, unfortunately a little inconsistent, so that is the friction that we run into.

S Speaker 123:35No, not, not really. So if it's a physical sim, then we ship them physical Sims. When they buy the subscriptions, they just have to plug it in, and more often than not, again, to my point, there are some software challenges, especially with Samsung, but more often than not, you plug it in and it just works. Especially with Apple and esim, you would just use MDM to provision it over the app, so there's no per device provisioning. Most of that actually credit to our engineering team. It's actually really well sort I mean, this is one of the main reasons why Apple loves us, because we really make it simple.

S Speaker 124:49the ROIs? Well, it depends on how you do it. Everybody does it differently. Some loop people compare it to Wi Fi, like Cargill. And so their cost business case is based on, you know, when you are refreshing a site for Wi Fi, they're able to get a better network for 1/3 the cost. That's their ROI versus different people like hunt and BP. They do it based on enabling new use cases, shortening their turnaround maintenance windows from a month to a week. So everybody has their own metric on how they do it, usually, like a hunt is a good example. They told us their three year subscription, they got a payback in nine months, right? So that's the everybody has their own method of calculating the business case. But yeah, we have a bunch of those case studies and all. In fact, I didn't show it here, but you know, we also have a bunch on Gartner peer reviews, where we are in the private 5g side by far.

S Speaker 126:17We are, we are very we we are almost extreme about using that conversation at the head end of the sales process to qualify, and so rather than having the debate on it, we typically we train our sales teams, especially SCS, to do the reverse, where we challenge the prospect. Why can't you do this with Wi Fi? Is it really not doable with Wi Fi? And only when that debate is the customer convinces us that they can't do it, do we actually pass it through to our funnel? Okay? Right? And so look, a lot of the customers, if you don't have one of those three problems, I said, coverage, mobility or true reliability, they can work with Wi Fi, but honestly, in these environments, that is just not doable. And by the way, there's nothing that has happened in Wi Fi that has changed the laws of physics around those

If they are in that mode, we tell them this is not there's no point putting in private 5g right now.

S Speaker 129:18just from a competitive perspective, I would say, till about two months back, eight out of 10 accounts that we competed in that were significant size was Nokia was our primary competitor. And like I already said, Not only have we won against them, but we have actually taken away customers from that. What has changed, I think, is Nokia going through its own central restructuring, has certainly deprioritized private 5g in fact, I think they have publicly come out and said it's up for sale, that part of the business, and we'll see where that lands. On the other hand, Ericsson has gone the other way. When we started three, four years ago, they were not very focused on this market. Now they have increased their focus considerably, and they have gotten decent success in the super high end manufacturing, where their radios and reliability is appreciated, but they are easily 10x our cost, and right now. We're not seeing them in most accounts, but we have seen them in one or two very large accounts, like Tesla is a good example, where they are running half of their network. Cisco and HP are still only dabbling. I think they're still primarily Wi Fi focus. And then there's a whole series of smaller players who either mostly just do the core and then they combine it with radios from air span or other small cell vendors to put together a solution. Typically they show up through a systems integrator. But more often than not, large enterprises are starting to go away from that architecture. I think they do want an end to end. They want a single throat to choke like they're used to. And so I think that's getting less and less visible in the market. From our perspective,

S Speaker 131:48Ericsson smaller. Ericsson is probably doing around 30 to 40 right now, but they have their individual accounts. Deal sizes are significantly bigger. So I'll give you one just super good example. There's a warehouse in Tesla which we did a site survey for our quoted price to Tesla was 220k I think Ericsson charged them 1.8 million for that, plus, I think it was something like 100k a month, 100k a year, or additional for managed service. So Ericsson has a much fewer customers, but their deal sizes and ASP is a order of magnitude bigger

S Speaker 132:56All right? So going forward, we have kind of a three way plan. I mean, one is just, given the liquidity crisis, we just needed to extend runway. Second is come back to growth, and in parallel, given the environment we are in, we will start to explore the exit options, at least, even if it's, you know, not the preferred choice in any point, but we have to do that. So the three things in the extend runway, I think, like Quinn briefly referred to, we did significant cost reductions. We did it in two phases, from a headcount reduction perspective. We did the first one in June, 2 one in September, as I said, we had begun the year after the expansion of the sales force at a headcount of about 135 people, that is now sitting at about 56 people. So it's been a very significant headcount reduction. The OPEX and the network do not show the same proportion of reduction, primarily because, if I could remember, if you remember, I told you we had to do the contract manufacturer transition. So there is a whole bunch of NRE fees. There is last minute, last buys of inventory. There is some kind of long pole inventory, long allocation items that we have had to do, etc, etc. All of that is contributing to the non payroll OPEX in q4 and next year q1 will still be higher than normal. So that's why this, while it has come down, this is really when all that has flushed out. Our average monthly OPEX will be just over a million, and then the net burn will be at about 670, 5k and this is assuming, essentially, that we don't get a lot of improvement from this year. So I think in our financial plan, we are assuming a super conservative plan of 7 million in PCB for the next 12 months, which is basically what we did this year, which has been a terrible year, just to be super conservative, and we are talking to all the insiders about this $5 million bridge between these three. And we have one additional complication, Gavin put up a slide, which is we had a line of credit from SVB that was being used for our inventory purchases and that had a one year, 12 months runway covenant on it. And we have convinced SVB with conditional on this 5 million closing to give us an extension and on that till July, but assuming we return the 3 million from now to July. And we do this plan, we then have runway to July. So this is basically just, I almost think of it as stay alive for now. And the reason this is important is really in the context of the return to growth part.

S Speaker 236:00Yeah, so the SBB conversation, yeah, required for them to not, I guess, or we don't have to give them the $3 million back like right now, is that. So we

S Speaker 136:37So what we get Quinn by doing that is we don't have to return on the 3 million like Nick this week, and all we get is they're basically given us reprieve of returning that 3 million over the next six months. It's not that we have not returning it.
So what we get Quinn by doing that is we don't have to return on the 3 million like Nick this week, and all we get is they're basically given us reprieve of returning that 3 million over the next six months. It's not that we have not returning it.

S Speaker 236:55Oh, I see, so you have to slowly pay the back, correct? Okay, okay. Also then the out of the 5 million, 3 million is going to go to SVP, right?
Oh, I see, so you have to slowly pay the back, correct? Okay, okay. Also then the out of the 5 million, 3 million is going to go to SVP, right?

S Speaker 137:07Unfortunately, that's currently the plan, right? I think the point here is, during this six month window, we have to either get back at 12 months runway and then maybe renegotiate a different line of credit, or something else happens, and so on.

S Speaker 237:25Okay, so that's Yeah, yeah, I thought we might be able to push them off.
Okay, so that's Yeah, yeah, I thought we might be able to push them off.
Okay, so that's Yeah, yeah, I thought we might be able to push them off.
Okay, so that's Yeah, yeah, I thought we might be able to push them off.
S Speaker 137:30Or, yeah, they have not been willing to budge from that. I think that. I think my feeling is we talk about it in the upside deals, if we win the Google deal, I think that might be the time to go renegotiate, maybe a different deal with them. Okay? So I think from then, from a return to growth perspective, I think I already touched upon the install base, where quite a few of these customers are starting to roll out. So I think that gives me good conversation, good hope that we'll get back and that, in combination with where we are with quite a few of these customers in very advanced stages, I am very confident just in this, which I consider run rate business, instead of the assumed 7 million, I think we can do at least 20 to 30% better. We are not putting it in the financial commit plan, but I'm very confident that can actually happen given the state these accounts are in. And then there are five main upside deals that are in advanced stages, that we are chasing right now, and the most significant and the most immediate one is the Google data center deal, and they want to deploy private 5g in their data centers, because they essentially have the exact same problem as any other industrial facility in their data center, which is with all the metal and all the interference from EMI their Wi Fi is basically non operational, and they have a sparse number of users going in. When they go in for maintenance, but when they go in, they absolutely need good connectivity. So they are going to do two data centers with salona in q1, in the US, and actually, Quinn, I haven't had a chance to update all of you either, but Friday, we got a verbal confirmation that Vodafone won the contract with salona with us for this so, oh, now we are so that's, that's, I mean, if we don't have a contract and a PO but we got the yes. In fact, talked to the Google procurement guy just an hour ago. So that's moving forward nicely. This will be a 4 million PCB to us. Google has asked for somewhat different payment terms, so from a cash perspective, we will collect about 2.2 and then the other 1.8 will come over three years. But I think that will be a substantial thing. And then there is one more data center, which they want to do in the first half in Europe. So we should expect another one and a half to 2 million PCB within that six month window. So this one's looking good, and we should move and then overall, they have about 20 data centers that they have planned to deploy this in the next 24 to 36 months. So this could be very significant for us. That's really good news. Yeah, that's great news. It is great news. That is going to be great news. And by the way, Digital Bridge also owns this company switch, which is doing a whole bunch of data centers that Alex connected me to, and so I'm talking to them in jam. We have 22 new data centers they are building up, and that CIO is equally excited about doing the same thing. So this could be a vertical into itself. That changes the trajectory.
Or, yeah, they have not been willing to budge from that. I think that.

S Speaker 142:40Cargill is an existing customer. As I said, they are already deploying 10 to 20 sites every quarter. What we have put in front of them is an offer to essentially do a pre buy, effectively for their planned number of sites with a slight extra discount. And if they do that, then they essentially just give us 5 million of cash, and that gives them a rollout for the next 18 months. So they're evaluating that that will go through their budgetary approvals in the next month or month or two, and then we'll know whether they're biting or they keep rolling out side by side. So that's, I think, the question there, whether it's five or it ends up being one to two. In the next 12 months, Cargill will certainly be one of our largest customers. It's just, can we get them to bite on the bigger contract? Is the question.

What we have put in front of them is an offer to essentially do a pre buy, effectively for their planned number of sites with a slight extra discount. And if they do that, then they essentially just give us 5 million of cash, and that gives them a rollout for the next 18 months. So they're evaluating that that will go through their budgetary approvals in the next month or month or two, and then we'll know whether they're biting or they keep rolling out side by side. So that's, I think, the question there, whether it's five or it ends up being one to two. In the next 12 months, Cargill will certainly be one of our largest customers. It's just, can we get them to bite on the bigger contract? Is the question.

S Speaker 143:35I think they will probably 70 to 80% they'll probably end up at a 2 million range is my guess. Quinn, I think the 5 million is a slight upside that we probably won't get, but we'll get shooting for it. Even 2 million will be great. The 2 million, which gives us a good upside,

S Speaker 243:52if we get 2 million, that means 2 million cash up front, or one
if we get 2 million, that means 2 million cash up front, or one
if we get 2 million, that means 2 million cash up front, or one

43:56yes, yes, 2 million cash up.
yes, yes, 2 million cash up.

44:00And these are upsides, right? These
And these are upsides, right? These
And these are upsides, right? These
And these are upsides, right? These
S Speaker 144:02are all upsides. These are all not baked in the plan, okay, great, okay. And then Aramco is, I think we have briefly talked about it, but they essentially want an indoor small cell in the 450 megahertz, which is this esoteric frequency. And for about a year we have been in chicken and egg because we have told them we need money to go finish the development, because it's a one off that nobody else in the world needs. And they have been saying, show us the product, and then we will potentially do some version of single source or not. But I think Abhishek has finally pushed hard on this, and so I'm meeting them, either next week or in Jan, in person to try to negotiate to get a three to $4 million either NRE or prepaid or some mix, to get that off that problem. So there is immediate potential of that model. Overall. Inside Aramco, they have 2000 buildings that they have committed to providing coverage. So that could be we managed to actually get the single source contract. It could be a massive opportunity. So that's the last one that we are chasing here. So there's quite a few that are potentials, I would say, in the order of probability, Google is clearly done. Walmart and Home Depot are next. Cargill is how much do we get? And Aramco, there's work to be done. If we could allow equity investment, I suspect they would do 5 million right away, but that's this blocked by our desire to stay under the cfpf threshold. All right, so with that having been said, while we are doing that, look, if that happens, you know, the pressure to get exits is obviously lower, but in parallel, I think we are certainly going to start having these conversations, and some we have already done. And you know, this is kind of the universe, the landscape of universe out there who could be interested. And some of them we know are concretely trusted, I would say the focus area within this is probably these five or six companies, not to rule anything out, but I think that's really where the things are.

46:14I think Cisco's main
S Speaker 146:17problem is that their current perception of private G market is not a big enough Tam, and so that is going to be the challenge, but we'll see where that goes. Fortinet is not a big acquiring company, but, you know, we are seeing so many joint customers, so we have to probe, I think Ericsson is probably the most likely and most obvious person here. They have interest in the market. Our product is very complementary to them, and VAB has introduced me to a lot of their leadership team, so that conversation has already started to an extent. So I think that's probably and then the industrial guys are probably a little bit of a stretch, though we know Siemens does have ambitions here, and they're struggling a little on product execution, so it's not out of the question.

S Speaker 247:05Hey, Rajiv, just so when, whenever you kick this thing off. Yeah, I think worth just I'll connect you with our core dev team, at least run it by them. Sure, absolutely. My sense is our level interest probably won't be super high, but I want to make sure they have a chance to take a look.

47:24Absolutely makes sense.

S Speaker 147:28All right, so this is kind of the financial plan, as I said. This is assuming none of those upside deals happen. So super conservative. Even just with Google, it gets a lot better. And you know, this assumes, as I said, Seven 7 million in the next 12 months and next fiscal year, doing 7.5 that leads, in turn, to this revenue and this net burn. So I expect us to beat this. But there are enough customers here that we are chasing here as well. And really a more detailed version of that is this. I'll flash this so everybody can really just maybe examine this a little.

S Speaker 248:12So the one is the orange or the yellow ones is basically next year, right?
So the one is the orange or the yellow ones is basically next year, right?
So the one is the orange or the yellow ones is basically next year, right?
So the one is the orange or the yellow ones is basically next year, right?
S Speaker 148:16That is correct. This is next fiscal year, starting Feb. We are in this current quarter of q4 26
That is correct. This is next fiscal year, starting Feb. We are in this current quarter of q4 26
That is correct. This is next fiscal year, starting Feb. We are in this current quarter of q4 26

and that assumes that the 3.7
and that assumes that the 3.7
and that assumes that the 3.7
48:30cash, oh, no, that's
S Speaker 148:32cash stores. This is the cash so, so we have a little bit of just some account receivable backlog all the way from q2 and q3 so that's why this number is not directly proportional, but as you go out, you essentially book in a quarter and then get most of the collection done The quarter after
cash stores. This is the cash so, so we have a little bit of just some account receivable backlog all the way from q2 and q3 so that's why this number is not directly proportional, but as you go out, you essentially book in a quarter and then get most of the collection done The quarter after

S Speaker 249:03and in q4 26 that shows the 5 million bridge, right?

and in q4 26 that shows the 5 million bridge, right?
and in q4 26 that shows the 5 million bridge, right?
S Speaker 149:06That is correct? Yes. This assumes the 5 million bridge in Jan end, which is really the end of q4 out of the 3 million of the SVB line of credit, we are due to return one and a half. So this assumes five in one and a half return, and then the regular operations, yeah.
That is correct? Yes. This assumes the 5 million bridge in Jan end, which is really the end of q4 out of the 3 million of the SVB line of credit, we are due to return one and a half. So this assumes five in one and a half return, and then the regular operations, yeah.

S Speaker 249:27So this will take you through July, or basically,
So this will take you through July, or basically,
So this will take you through July, or basically,

S Speaker 149:30this will take us July is literally the last date in this plan, yes, yeah.

this will take us July is literally the last date in this plan, yes, yeah.
this will take us July is literally the last date in this plan, yes, yeah.
S Speaker 249:35And then if you get, like, the 2 million from Google, that take you a quarter
And then if you get, like, the 2 million from Google, that take you a quarter
And then if you get, like, the 2 million from Google, that take you a quarter
And then if you get, like, the 2 million from Google, that take you a quarter
