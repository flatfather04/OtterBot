S Speaker 12:59absolutely Daniel and excited to know more. I just wanted to mention before we get into the discussions, that while industrial automation IoT are a big focus area for us, we feel Qualcomm has a very strong strategic play there. Ah, Bob T at its current round might be around early for us. So we are typically a Series A investor. Our check sizes are anywhere between five to 15. Sometimes we have done smaller checks, but that's where our strategy is. But I still wanted to connect with you, have a chat and understand more, and then down the line, maybe we will have a play.

S Speaker 14:01yes, we have companies in that space. And even internally at Qualcomm, we work with a lot of, I would say, companies which may require hardware observability. So always happy to make those connections

6:02Yeah, thanks a lot.
S Speaker 26:05And do you do you invest in European founders as well, or only America
And do you do you invest in European founders as well, or only America

And do you do you invest in European founders as well, or only America
S Speaker 16:09or so. From a founders nationality perspective, that's not really an issue for us. If the company is based in us, we would, sorry, Europe. We would like to route it through our Europe team. So we are global fund. We have offices in us, Latin America, in Europe, in London, Israel, China and India. So if it's a different geography company, we just routed through some of our global teams.

S Speaker 26:34The company we have is in Delaware in the US. I used to live in New York in the US, but now I am in Europe. And Michael founder as well. But we also want to cover the US. The US is it's an important market for us as well, right that we are facing

S Speaker 26:57yes, right now, yes. But who knows, in maybe in six months since, like, if the biggest contract happens to be in the US, then situation would be very different,
yes, right now, yes. But who knows, in maybe in six months since, like, if the biggest contract happens to be in the US, then situation would be very different,

right from this, and where in Europe are you based?
S Speaker 27:17yeah, Western Europe, yeah, not, not like Belarus or Absolutely. So, yeah, thanks for the intro. I can introduce myself very quickly, and then my co founder so I am Daniel. I have over eight years of experience at Oliver. I am working in data analytic projects, also strategy projects on revenue optimization, performance management projects, not building models for inventory and Computer Management, building algorithms optimize facing in in retail stores to sell more and things like that. So before, before Oliver Wyman, I worked at Rocket Internet, launching the company Genie in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. Genie is like Uber, but for official license taxes in the Middle East. And I was in charge of the operations. I had a monthly budget. I hired the team, I got the drivers to use the application. My main KPI was fulfillment of the rights. And I also got partnerships with corporate to like clients and but when I left, we have 5000 writes per day between COVID and before that, I graduated in Barcelona. I also have two approved patents, one IoT in Europe, IoT patent in Europe, another one about engineering in Spain. And I also launched a company in 2021 a digital business card got 5000 paid customers, and also got 5000 social media with 300,000 followers and over 100 billion views. And that's me, and my co founder is a PhD in robotics, John. He is originally from Turkey, but he has lived in Germany most of his life, he has over 14 years of experience building robots, deploying, building and deploying robots, and developing software, mostly AI solutions. And he has worked a lot in academia, doing projects on research, projects on electronic systems and collaborative robots. And he has also worked in the defense industry, at aselsam in the electronic division for tanks and weapons for tanks. And lately, he has worked at microbes. It's a computer vision robotics company. They put cameras on robots, and they make the robots do harder tasks using the cameras, and they he led the technical team from seat to CDC, and he led projects for Mercedes to tier one automotive manufacturing clients. And these projects involved end to end deployments of robots. And we met in August. 2023 I joined Ambler in 2022 I joined the cohort. Excuse me, I think I'm getting out of it. So I joined Ambler in 2022 and and someone end of 2022 and someone affiliated with Ambler introduced me with John. He was also looking for a co founder back then, and we both explored different ideas while having more jobs like analytics for setups and SMEs, compliance, regulatory projects, System Tools, things like that. And in october 2024 we still got the strategy for robots, and we expanded this code plan to include not just robotic hardware, and we just grasp all of the data available across the production line or fleet and analyze it to diagnose issues and solve them. It's like, you know, this data, like you said, the data absorbability layer, the data doc for hardware, and like this site, reliability engineering for hire. And, yeah, that's what we do.
yeah, Western Europe, yeah, not, not like Belarus or Absolutely. So, yeah, thanks for the intro. I can introduce myself very quickly, and then my co founder so I am Daniel.

14:31A, u g, u r Y, Yes,
14:39that's an Italian word. Oh, I didn't know that.
that's an Italian word. Oh, I didn't know that.
that's an Italian word. Oh, I didn't know that.
that's an Italian word. Oh, I didn't know that.
S Speaker 114:44Sorry. Not a, u g, u r y,
Sorry. Not a, u g, u r y,
Sorry. Not a, u g, u r y,
Sorry. Not a, u g, u r y,
S Speaker 214:49r y. So yes,
14:57I'll take a look, but I have the answer.
I'll take a look, but I have the answer.
I'll take a look, but I have the answer.
I'll take a look, but I have the answer.
15:03Oops, today, sorry.
S Speaker 215:07Let me go and show you. This is how it works, but I'll show you these slides. So this tool,
Let me go and show you. This is how it works, but I'll show you these slides. So this tool,
Let me go and show you. This is how it works, but I'll show you these slides. So this tool,
Let me go and show you. This is how it works, but I'll show you these slides. So this tool,
15:17it's a manufacturing solution. Yeah,
it's a manufacturing solution. Yeah,
it's a manufacturing solution. Yeah,
it's a manufacturing solution. Yeah,
S Speaker 215:22they typically don't have a process to calibrate the data automatically. And what I mean by that is to understand the meaning of each field automatically, and we have it, and I can show you how we do it in a bit, but that's a key differentiation part. Also, our tool is very easy to use. We want to make it useful for non technical people, for operators and field engineers, not expert engineers, although expert engineers can also use it right, and we also tailor our insights to the specific applications that the companies use by grasping the information of all of the manuals and technical documentation available and and that's that's these things that I just mentioned are the key differentiation factors, apart from replicating the steps that expert engineers do when analyzing we have delegated tools, red dedicated rack solutions to parse logs, another solution, the rack solution to parse the manuals. We have tools to correlate data between telemetry and logs. So we have a bunch of Python scripts to do these type of tasks that expert engineers do manually. That's in addition to what I just said. But yeah,
they typically don't have a process to calibrate the data automatically. And what I mean by that is to understand the meaning of each field automatically, and we have it, and I can show you how we do it in a bit, but that's a key differentiation part.

But yeah,
16:40right, understand that, yes, and
right, understand that, yes, and
right, understand that, yes, and
right, understand that, yes, and
S Speaker 216:43you know, in this diagnostic tools, they are easy to use, but they don't have a clue, like I said, on what type of hardware is being used or connected consulting rooms are, you know, they are a service, so not a product. So obviously, it's going to be very expensive and not automated. And then the tools from OEMs, like I said, they, they just don't know anything about other or tools. So it's not multi machine. It cannot be like it's not a tool useful for end users to manage their whole hardware fleet and production. And it's not easy to use. It's the calibration data is very manual. It's also very expensive. It's not tailored to the specific applications, because the applications not only include the robots, but also other hardware which is not covered in their application. So that's, that's, that's a problem. So to give you an example, the cells have. This is a welding cell, for example. This is a robot, but it has other devices as well, like you see here. And these devices are not part of the tools from the OEMs, so the tools from OEMs would only have this device, for example, you find a robot that would not be sufficient to diagnose anything or resolve issues, because the cell works in conjunction of all of these hardware devices. So you cannot analyze one hardware in silo,
you know, in this diagnostic tools, they are easy to use, but they don't have a clue, like I said, on what type of hardware is being used or connected consulting rooms are, you know, they are a service, so not a product.

18:18right? It will not work.
right? It will not work.
right? It will not work.
right? It will not work.
S Speaker 118:23And how do you do Daniel, you mentioned about auto data calibration. Can you double click a little bit on that. How do you do that? Yes. So we just,
And how do you do Daniel, you mentioned about auto data calibration. Can you double click a little bit on that. How do you do that? Yes. So we just,
And how do you do Daniel, you mentioned about auto data calibration. Can you double click a little bit on that. How do you do that? Yes. So we just,
And how do you do Daniel, you mentioned about auto data calibration. Can you double click a little bit on that. How do you do that? Yes. So we just,
18:39yeah, we just, we just

Yep, that's that's typically what we do, yeah, understood, and yeah, that's, that's a calibration. And then you have the issues here in the identified, you know, the Reds are causing downtime. Yellows and oranges are not. The yellow and orange issues are not, you know, today, they are not even captured by by the companies and and we will enable them to get these insights and the rest, they take hours and days to diagnose with us. They take minutes. So that's, that's pretty much the value added? Yeah, so that's pretty much what we do. So I don't know if you have any questions, or

S Speaker 119:55I would love to understand a little bit more about the GTM. How are you pricing it, and in terms of traction, where are you today?

S Speaker 220:06So the we had a lot of quite a journey validating these across well startups and then OEMs and indicators. And now the target we have is enterprises, and we are working with drop go, and we will work with Priyesh as well. And they the pilots would be to be defined, it will be five digit contract, and they ACB would be six digits, starting with 100k but we will price per robot per year, or per machine, per PLC per year, for per hour, unit per year. Yeah, based on, based on the data connected. So if only logs and manuals are connected, it will be a price. If logs, telemetry and manuals are connected, it will be more expensive, right? And it will be like that, yeah,

S Speaker 124:41I would like to unpack this a little bit more. Let me do my own research and come back to you with some questions like I said, it might be around early for us, just because writing smaller checks, it does not move the needle for us. We have to involve a lot of legal and compliance team and get Qualcomm permission so we don't write smaller checks. But I do see a use case here, and maybe would like, can you send me the deck as well? And if you have any case studies, would like to go through them. I would like to float it internally at Qualcomm and see if there are any use cases that we may adopt.

S Speaker 226:01and Bob D was able to find patterns one hour Before at 9:50pm indicating that an issue could happen, so things like that and well, and these are other issues, like diagnosing an issue, so like when there is an issue, the tricky part is to identify the root cause, because without the root cause, You cannot fix it. Otherwise you just do patches. So they like,
