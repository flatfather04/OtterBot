S Speaker 10:00with accuracy that number is with human in the loop right, right. So, the question is what is the accuracy without human in the loop? And then related to this is at what point can we reduce costs significantly right. So what today what what is the cost of the human in the loop and what do you see the curve you see that evolving over time so, that we can have accuracy without you know, a whole lot of human decomposition will always have right so, I think that a high level wanted to see do you have you know, what is the accuracy without him and is that something that makes sense to measure or or not?

S Speaker 14:10video me needs footage. You do 24/7 footage, right. I mean, every I am everything is footage, right? Yes. And the cameras are ingesting the video the basically the live motion. So what what is the 060 3%?

S Speaker 24:30Imagine imagine you had a real number 1000 people shopped at Aldi today and from case there's 8000 people, there were an average of 12 items. So it's 1000 Sorry, not 8000 No 1000 And all the 1000 people in on average, eight items, so 8000 items, right? That took what 11 hours of opening. So 11 hours of producing video to to annotate this. Maybe on average we did 16 seconds per item, or 10 seconds per item. Some items weren't required to be annotated some items required, omitted but on average, normalizing the number of items, it took 16 seconds. Okay, so that's 16 seconds of human time, but but

S Speaker 15:28you're not annotating 1000 items, you're getting 0.3% of the items. That's what you're saying?
you're not annotating 1000 items, you're getting 0.3% of the items. That's what you're saying?
you're not annotating 1000 items, you're getting 0.3% of the items. That's what you're saying?
you're not annotating 1000 items, you're getting 0.3% of the items. That's what you're saying?
S Speaker 25:35No, I'm annotating even different number that normalizes to six cents, the 0.3% Because it's not about the items. Let's say someone picks up 10 Things puts 10 things down and leaves with one. Right, I still have to understand all of those things. Yes. And so we normalize it by the number of items, ultimately the number of interactions, but I'm trying to save as we look at the number of seconds on average per item left the store. So if I had, I don't know five people working five different people different shifts, looking at all the and they were 10 hours, 10 min hours. These are fake numbers, but to 10 Min hours, I can divide that by the number of items. And then I look at the platform, how many of those hours were actually spent processing case and that's the 0.3 so they spent 0.3 or their time looking at something for all the which is Video produced because video is proportional to time. Does that make sense? So did I confuse you more?

S Speaker 26:56Okay, I'll simplify it a bit. One camera, one hour video. 100 items go by, and I only have to annotate. Let's say 50% of that just for numbers which is half an hour. That's half an hour could correspond to 1000 items. Now it's point 3% Or point 2% of an hour is whatever a few minutes. So during that hour, we sold 1000 items. Point three of those that have the time spent on that and may have 10 items may have 100 items may have whatever but it's just a small percentage. So

S Speaker 17:37you need annotation is effectively labeling. It's very fine that yes, it's a coke. It's not something else, right? So that's the human piece that are dates that labels Yes, it is right. So correct. In most cases the system recognizes and the system is trained well enough that you have very high confidence that you don't need to annotate is when the system is not sure what happened or again a combination of movement put back in the back into tray or you know drop something or whatever Dan. The system is not yet smart enough and you need to verify with data and notation

S Speaker 28:22Yes, it will say differently. I've said everything is predicted. Even the things that the system doesn't know. They'll make a prediction it will say it's, it's across, even if it's a weird thing, right? But people will make a prediction with confidence. And if that confidence is below, then acumen comes in, but it's not on the item if the prediction is actually on. Was it Priyesh That did this activity was the activity you pick up or put down? Was it two items, three items one item? Was it a group shopping and now let me look at what the object is. So in any of these stages, it might actually say well, I don't know if it's crashed. I think it's brioche, but I'm not sure. So please human confirm. And so what the human will see is the cross on the left, it's one everything is good. In previous token and the human will say yes, pretty stupid. Just check. Okay, the mistake was it's true to croissant Zuan and they'll say no, it's not good. It's one thing. Okay, that's it. Okay. All right. And so back to your curve

S Speaker 29:37You can because it's still right, though. Yeah. Thank you. So
You can because it's still right, though. Yeah. Thank you. So
You can because it's still right, though. Yeah. Thank you. So
You can because it's still right, though. Yeah. Thank you. So
S Speaker 19:41the costs have dropped just over the past year from say 3020 32 Okay, right. So they're like down to eight. And the light blue line is actually lower than the dark blue line because your actual costs are drop dropping faster than projected. You have this projections with again, this
the costs have dropped just over the past year from say 3020 32 Okay, right. So they're like down to eight. And the light blue line is actually lower than the dark blue line because your actual costs are drop dropping faster than projected. You have this projections with again, this

S Speaker 210:10was yeah, this was six months ago, we were here. And we thought with more data, more deployments, more technology, etc. We'll get this way. And we we've got some good positive things and we got here. Okay. All right.
was yeah, this was six months ago, we were here. And we thought with more data, more deployments, more technology, etc. We'll get this way. And we we've got some good positive things and we got here. Okay. All right.

S Speaker 110:27So this is now so it's costing eight cents per item. Right? And we are charging depending on what type of store anywhere from 12 cents to a turn number 30 cents. The
So this is now so it's costing eight cents per item. Right? And we are charging depending on what type of store anywhere from 12 cents to a turn number 30 cents. The
So this is now so it's costing eight cents per item. Right? And we are charging depending on what type of store anywhere from 12 cents to a turn number 30 cents. The
So this is now so it's costing eight cents per item. Right? And we are charging depending on what type of store anywhere from 12 cents to a turn number 30 cents. The
S Speaker 210:40average is 32. Yeah, that's the average. The average globally is 32 cents.
average is 32. Yeah, that's the average. The average globally is 32 cents.
average is 32. Yeah, that's the average. The average globally is 32 cents.
average is 32. Yeah, that's the average. The average globally is 32 cents.
S Speaker 110:47That we are able to charge for items. Correct. Okay, so what's the sort of like a traditional grocery store like Aldi, a drop cut, the margins are higher, so I'm assuming there so as

S Speaker 211:00Rob is paying, I think 16 cents now. And an all these thing paying all these things, I think, maybe the same 16 or 17. However, all the was paying five cents before the negotiation, and five cents is a win as you heard calling in the board meeting. Five cents is a more it's a growth stage for all if they get to five cent if we propose five cents to them. They want to open more stores, but they're paying now 60 cents,
Rob is paying, I think 16 cents now. And an all these thing paying all these things, I think, maybe the same 16 or 17.

S Speaker 111:33and then store that's higher. Than 32 cents.
S Speaker 211:41We'll pay 50 Something cents. Any stadium has been between 38 to 50 cents.
We'll pay 50 Something cents. Any stadium has been between 38 to 50 cents.
We'll pay 50 Something cents. Any stadium has been between 38 to 50 cents.
We'll pay 50 Something cents. Any stadium has been between 38 to 50 cents.
S Speaker 111:49Okay. Okay. Related to this God, so I know when, you know, you had a change of guard, Steve said hey, we don't have all the runway in the moon we need to focus let's focus on smaller stores. Let's focus on you know, more contained environments and higher ticket items. Now we can charge more. It's right. Yeah. That's the stadium. Yeah, and the math still works even though there's some cases only 30 games a year they still you know, they they're the they are. They are buying the cameras they buy the hardware they buy it's not right they just pay for the service and everything is in the box and it's still the math still works out for them.
Okay. Okay. Related to this God, so I know when, you know, you had a change of guard, Steve said hey, we don't have all the runway in the moon we need to focus let's focus on smaller stores. Let's focus on you know, more contained environments and higher ticket items. Now we can charge more. It's right. Yeah. That's the stadium.

They are buying the cameras they buy the hardware they buy it's not right they just pay for the service and everything is in the box and it's still the math still works out for them.
S Speaker 212:39It does this way. So most stadiums will have between 60 to 150. Like let's say a normal curve most stadiums are somewhere between 50 to 160 minutes. The best stadiums will do like 200 Something like I think so find those like go in and 60 year depends on what the city museums tour and then the really bad ones like Like I'd say like an arena like NASCAR does like to a year or three or four or whatever it is. And so the ROI for the ones that do the less than a number of stadiums, that number of events works because our business or our pricing changes. So we go to them and say look, instead of you being this much capex with this much OPEX okay, we'll we'll take a little bit of a hit on the hardware. But your OP X Brian is much larger. At the end of the day, Fabio will average things out to be somewhere like 30,000 a year per store or something like that. And they're comfortable at the pricing per item because they're happy, because I'm not paying once the store is closed. I only pay when I sell and so for those that do little events is good. They like it. For those that do a lot. They're more comfortable about paying a steady SAS fee. So we say okay, you based any SAS fee and your price per item is a little bit lower. Okay. At the end of the day, it averages out to be the same. The only the only thing I'll add it add in is when we don't do food and beverage providers or or more than one site, we do enterprise agreements. For example. NASCAR, they go through different arenas. So imagine if you say a new buy a million items, and you can use those items in different new everythingness. So you activate these arenas whenever you want. So this way they feel like they're purchasing something that could move with their deployments. So they're not paying for this store and that store in that store when the items consumed pickup
It does this way. So most stadiums will have between 60 to 150. Like let's say a normal curve most stadiums are somewhere between 50 to 160 minutes. The best stadiums will do like 200 Something like I think so find those like go in and 60 year depends on what the city museums tour and then the really bad ones like Like I'd say like an arena like NASCAR does like to a year or three or four or whatever it is.

So we go to them and say look, instead of you being this much capex with this much OPEX okay, we'll we'll take a little bit of a hit on the hardware. But your OP X Brian is much larger. At the end of the day, Fabio will average things out to be somewhere like 30,000 a year per store or something like that. And they're comfortable at the pricing per item because they're happy, because I'm not paying once the store is closed. I only pay when I sell and so for those that do little events is good. They like it. For those that do a lot. They're more comfortable about paying a steady SAS fee. So we say okay, you based any SAS fee and your price per item is a little bit lower. Okay. At the end of the day, it averages out to be the same. The only the only thing I'll add it add in is when we don't do food and beverage providers or or more than one site, we do enterprise agreements. For example. NASCAR, they go through different arenas. So imagine if you say a new buy a million items, and you can use those items in different new everythingness. So you activate these arenas whenever you want. So this way they feel like they're purchasing something that could move with their deployments. So they're not paying for this store and that store in that store when the items consumed pickup
It does this way. So most stadiums will have between 60 to 150. Like let's say a normal curve most stadiums are somewhere between 50 to 160 minutes. The best stadiums will do like 200 Something like I think so find those like go in and 60 year depends on what the city museums tour and then the really bad ones like Like I'd say like an arena like NASCAR does like to a year or three or four or whatever it is.

S Speaker 114:49price, okay. So the reason I asked this question was I understand the decision that was a business decision. I'm trying to figure out from a product capability. Can we do larger stores, right? Because historically, I know we started with smaller stores, and then you know, decreasing but the larger the store, the more more likely you're going to have problems right? The technology breaks down put it this way, you know, because the a lot of people have a lot of items or the chances for lower accuracy and higher costs, you know, naturally are are higher, right? So So today, what would you say we are capable of let's say we raise $40 million tomorrow? Sure. How can we grow beyond, you know, beyond what we've been focusing on over the past few years? That's
price, okay. So the reason I asked this question was I understand the decision that was a business decision. I'm trying to figure out from a product capability. Can we do larger stores, right?

S Speaker 215:47a great question. So we can go to much larger spaces. And I'll tell you, there's three vertical complexity increases when you get a larger space into a dome as a space that's 25,000 square feet. It's a pretty decent size grocery store. Actually standard Aldi is about 10,000 square feet 25,000 is like on the mid size for them. It's not a hypermarket for pet Gulmarg, but still so we are doing dragging it that it's going to accommodate more than 900 people at the same time. And it's going to happen a danger dome and we're ready for it. So that's not the
a great question. So we can go to much larger spaces. And I'll tell you, there's three vertical complexity increases when you get a larger space into a dome as a space that's 25,000 square feet.

And it's going to happen a danger dome and we're ready for it. So that's not the
S Speaker 116:24concern that I know one of the 50 stores that we're going to launch is 25,000 square feet. It is though
concern that I know one of the 50 stores that we're going to launch is 25,000 square feet. It is though

concern that I know one of the 50 stores that we're going to launch is 25,000 square feet. It is though
S Speaker 216:30it's a VIP section called the hill loft. And it's a restaurant bar. The shopping like this call it's 1/3 Or no, like two thirds of the size of the ring. On certain level. It's called the hill often it's all tracked and it's one of the spaces we do, yes. Wow. Okay,
it's a VIP section called the hill loft. And it's a restaurant bar. The shopping like this call it's 1/3 Or no, like two thirds of the size of the ring. On certain level. It's called the hill often it's all tracked and it's one of the spaces we do, yes. Wow. Okay,

S Speaker 216:54on size, that's not the complexity. So here's where the complexity increases. So when you go to a larger grocery, you will have a larger variety of things happening meaning in a larger grocery you have a deli counter and the cheese counter and other kinds of experiences that that are different, right? We, in my opinion are already ready to go there. But that's where the complexity increases. It's not like they're selling more fixtures in the same thing. It's just more different things like a bakery, and whatnot. So there, I love to go there and start to show the world that we can do these things. Because we again, for the injured dome, we're going to have what's called a cocktail handoff. So it's basically you can do a custom drink or you can do a custom thing and then you hand it off to the to the shopper, and they get it frictionless. So the same thing can be applied to daily do a cheese counter to a meat counter everything in the grocery store. So the third piece of complexity is you have more people doing more interactions. That's why we normalize the cost per item. But here's where the challenge is. If all he does 10,000 items per day at five cents if we go and just do five cents cost per cents times 10,000. That's $5,000 a day. Now, right? Now imagine a double that size, we doubled the number of people and doubled the number of interaction that's 10,000 a day. Now the question is can the client afford to pay or the business and the ROI still make sense that their orders are set up? I'm not concerned about the tech being operational, but the level of automation needs to be better so that the cost is lower so that they can come in
on size, that's not the complexity. So here's where the complexity increases.

S Speaker 118:46and so on. Okay, so today you feel it's a combination of tech improving so we can have last annotation so you can enable larger stores economically
and so on. Okay, so today you feel it's a combination of tech improving so we can have last annotation so you can enable larger stores economically

S Speaker 219:03correct. But the here's an advantage if you gave me 40 million tomorrow. A what I was telling the board remember that capacity model, I can go and offer all the more grocer, five ministers right now. Because I can go and operate in those stores and improve my systems. I create the flywheel. Basically there's a plant for two years in front of Aldi to get to five since then I believe we can do it then you see the projection of the graph. The issue is if you're giving this talk now, it will come faster because I get more data I get more experience I get more development. So that's what money does. It speeds up that process to get to then go to a grocer and say, Okay, let's do 100 All these in 1000 valleys, naturally, the moment you've crossed the five cents, all these like we want to grow this to the chain, not just because the economics work there, it's even better shrink than they do in any other stores.
correct. But the here's an advantage if you gave me 40 million tomorrow. A what I was telling the board remember that capacity model, I can go and offer all the more grocer, five ministers right now.

S Speaker 120:04So you're saying we've more money you can stress this the system more train the models better, which will lower your costs

S Speaker 120:18Okay. Last question from my standpoint and tear so competition, there's standard combinations are zipping there's three loaders grab and go. Right? Yep. What is your view? Of is the most serious contender What is your view of who fell off? You know who lost the game already?
Okay. Last question from my standpoint and tear so competition, there's standard combinations are zipping there's three loaders grab and go. Right? Yep. What is your view? Of is the most serious contender What is your view of who fell off? You know who lost the game already?

S Speaker 120:51you that okay, these guys could could turn things around and become a more serious competitor.
you that okay, these guys could could turn things around and become a more serious competitor.
you that okay, these guys could could turn things around and become a more serious competitor.
you that okay, these guys could could turn things around and become a more serious competitor.
S Speaker 220:58I would say that who fell off the horse is easy to see. Not only did it was the people there tech hasn't evolved, and they're not satisfying their customers. So they, I mean, they're not that I mean, they can come in and throw noise and fear and whatnot but, but they definitely are not going anywhere if we do our job. So

S Speaker 121:19how do we know and people easy? I think we even hired some people, right? Yeah, I really know about the tech.
how do we know and people easy? I think we even hired some people, right? Yeah, I really know about the tech.
how do we know and people easy? I think we even hired some people, right? Yeah, I really know about the tech.
how do we know and people easy? I think we even hired some people, right? Yeah, I really know about the tech.
S Speaker 221:27So all the people that are unipress The people that we hired a lot of information about the tech, then the companies that are using them are reaching out to us saying they're not renewing the contracts, and they want us to actually take over their stores. And so we have a plan. We have an internal button called Zip and ticker, which is to retrofit the two largest spaces they have and then we believe it's a house of cards. We take 10 store for employees nine from another and then everyone's got to come running saying please do it if we're obviously doing this successfully. But they're already verbally saying yes. Which we'll we're gonna get actually we have signatures for in addition to the same site where Zyban is up, and we have verbal to once that store is in and they validate to take over all visit in stores. They're just being conscious of where they were and others have been granted a photo. So has there been is that for me that Nana's Amazon. I fear Amazon still because of their pricing competition. They can still under prices if they want to. I'm not afraid of their tech to be honest because they're very heavy. Like the way they built their solutions very heavy for the retailer. And if the retailer was paying everything there would be no business for Amazon right now. Okay. But they still are the monster they are right so they can

S Speaker 122:58so so they had you know we all saw Amazon Go stores, which again are I don't know we 1000s per foot or something like that.
so so they had you know we all saw Amazon Go stores, which again are I don't know we 1000s per foot or something like that.

S Speaker 223:08Yeah, they're on the two to 3000 Yeah,
S Speaker 123:12maybe two. Yeah. Agree. Are those the ones that are closing or they were taking this technology and taking it to bigger you know, Whole Foods type stores.
maybe two. Yeah. Agree. Are those the ones that are closing or they were taking this technology and taking it to bigger you know, Whole Foods type stores.

S Speaker 223:22So what they did was they closed all the Whole Foods type stores, which was 37 of them that in wants more they have planned. So they definitely came out of the grocery segment. They've closed a lot of Amazon Go they didn't announce they close every Amazon Go but they've caused a lot of Amazon Go and they're still doing it. What they kept alive was what they call third party three PP. Just woke up genuine, which is their technology to others not themselves. That user in there focused or they left at least the announcement focused on stadia and in this kind of same place that we're playing right.

S Speaker 124:08Do you have a sense how many stores they have operating in stadia and just a trip up stadia I

S Speaker 224:13think they said it was suddenly they announced there's some article that says 73 I think that's what they claim. Okay. All right. So
think they said it was suddenly they announced there's some article that says 73 I think that's what they claim. Okay. All right. So

S Speaker 224:27So the story started with standard standard. It has pivoted out what we do, and I have some close friends that have worked there. So I have a friend started company got acquired by standard stay there for quite a few years and then left. The feeling is that Jordan Fisher is a great salesman and you can sell anything he wants. But it's his words. It's like a strong Ponzi scheme. What I think and then I'll put my more professional hat on and what I what I would say about saying is they've spent enough money to be to have cool tech. So they have cool things, but they don't have a consistent well built system to address autonomous retail problem. And so they've pivoted in a way so the new CEO was now the CEO it's a she, she is focusing their tech into the problems that their tech sauce, so they've got good planogram view so they're trying to get into planogram compliance. They've got good video annotation for the clients and they're trying to get to theft, but they went away from cameras, multiple cameras, they went away from frictionless and they're doing like this zone tracking. I can tell you that technically, they could not go beyond 200 square feet of tracking in real time. And that was one of the biggest challenges and so they basically focused on smaller areas and doing the pricing as like $100 per month per per trackable area whenever they call, which is a tiny tiny square in a store. So therefore I sent the tobacco and alcohol sales and things like that. Okay,

S Speaker 126:19but did they do the receipt stuff? You know cash? No, no. In a way it's what we think there's an opportunity for us to leverage at low cost the the

S Speaker 226:48then trigger just to close on that. trigger for me is a very good operations company with mid level tech and the challenge they're facing is that their stores that they have with our same clients that we have, they operate efficiently they can deploy, but there's no ROI. It's very expensive sensors everywhere, lots of cameras, lots of compute and the adoption and a cost, though, don't work. So the likes of Tesco, all the New Orleans. All these guys will finish their POCs which is like five, six doors. And right now they don't know what's going to happen whether they're going to continue or what's going to happen.

S Speaker 227:57know, we had a team of engineers in China. We reduced that team. We still have a handful of people in China. Developers not not any takers. We never use well we use them days in China for the stores that we have in China. But once we close the stores in China, we never use it as in China. Okay,
know, we had a team of engineers in China. We reduced that team. We still have a handful of people in China. Developers not not any takers. We never use well we use them days in China for the stores that we have in China. But once we close the stores in China, we never use it as in China. Okay,

S Speaker 128:20and so where are these guys? Or is are
S Speaker 228:24India in the Philippines? I think Ben Smith manages that. Under Shawn, the operations guy. Yeah.
India in the Philippines? I think Ben Smith manages that. Under Shawn, the operations guy. Yeah.

India in the Philippines? I think Ben Smith manages that. Under Shawn, the operations guy. Yeah.
S Speaker 328:38A couple very quick questions. Yeah. Following up on a few things you mentioned. You mentioned that, let's say on hypothetical sense we have a lot of money. Do you see cost as the only barrier to scaling the revenue or are there any other factors?
A couple very quick questions. Yeah. Following up on a few things you mentioned. You mentioned that, let's say on hypothetical sense we have a lot of money. Do you see cost as the only barrier to scaling the revenue or are there any other factors?

S Speaker 228:57There's a few other metrics, which are the capex, the cost of putting things in place we use standard off the shelf components, we definitely are cheaper than everywhere in the market. But the cheaper you get, the easier it is for someone to come in. So it's not just the annotation automation. It's also the compute. So types of work that we're doing with bulk I'm trying to use a lighter weight platform to power this is to be cheaper to come in. So that's another thing. But what would money bring us out? Like at the levels of 40 50 million? Here's what would happen today. It takes us about six weeks, let's say to deploy something. If we can train or when we can train a model to understand the space even better than we do today. We can actually deploy in an hour. So the gap between the six weeks to an hour is a training real, like bigger vision models to understand the study components of the scene. And that can only be done with money because I don't have the infrastructure like I would have to go to Azure and buy compute and train models to do this. And, and right now, those six weeks are basically engineers or deployment engineers, doing like manual tasks and automating like some semi automated things to set up a store. So the moment it takes an hour to set up a store, you can get the client to do it. Like the SI comes in, puts the cameras and they'll activate the store and that's it. So that's the curve for scale. And that could only happen with a bigger check. Otherwise, it will be like deployment engineers SI is coming in and taking time. Right,
