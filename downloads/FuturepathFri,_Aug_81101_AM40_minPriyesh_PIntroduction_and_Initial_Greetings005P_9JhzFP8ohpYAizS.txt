S Speaker 21:13in that case, you are in the middle of where I stay, and my other co founder, paruti, yeah. And we actually operate out of the WeWork in San Jose, Santa, Clara area. That's our go to hub.

S Speaker 14:11Absolutely. So I think some investments we have led specifically if it is highly strategic to the fund and we feel we can add value more through our research and engineering arms, but I would say 80% of our investments, we just tag along.

S Speaker 16:30Absolutely understand that. Saurav, so I'll answer the second question first, and the quick answer would be yes, we would like to make our decisions independently, but given if we are not leading, we would like to have a lead investor sort of priced around and set the terms if it's broadly in the ballpark, I think it does not matter for us if the price sort of moves a little bit here and there. So second question is easier to answer. On the first one, I would say, relatively speaking, our processes aren't as fast, especially since I look at a lot of AI native AI funds in the bay, our process typically takes about four to five weeks to completion from the first call. It involves, I would say, one, a couple of internal meetings, then we have the founder pitch to the entire management team, and then we have a voting process. So typically takes about four to five weeks from where we start our discussion to wiring the check.

S Speaker 27:27No, that's fair. I think we are not in a rush, just so that, you know, like we had village global. They had invested a million dollar in us in q4 they are our we were doing a friends and family round. We had one, I'm telling you. We had one call with Anne, who is the GP, on Wednesday and Thursday. She said, can we connect again? And said, Okay, we're gonna write a check to you. So it was that fast. Similarly, with alpha group as well, we had again paruti, my co founder, he knew, like a small fund, and they invested. They said, Hey, because it's all friend like, hey, we want to write a check. We had a meeting. They wrote a check. He said, Why don't you meet alpha square group guys? So I met one of their representative who was visiting here, and then did one call with their committee. It took them few days, but it was the other way around. They said, Oh no, no, no, let's, let's get it going. So we so we have money in the bank, so we don't need money. But the key reality for our company is I launched my commercial product in q1 we did POC in q4 when village global had participated, just with the launch, without any sales effort, we got $1.7 million in total contract value. Closed in q1 total contract value. Then in q2 that contract value surpassed $5 million total contract value. And another average deal size is three to five years. And this, this 5 million is equivalent to forward Arr, again, using forward ARR meaning beginning this quarter of already surpassed a million dollar. And the funny thing is, it appears now my average deal size was $400,000 and now there are, like, three or four deals that are in pipeline where the deal size is becoming more than $10 million so my ASR, my 5 million might by the end of this quarter, definitely by end of the year, we're going to surpass $10 million in total.

S Speaker 29:27absolute potential of forward, Arr, for committed Arr, for the next financial year, between two to $3 million and that is with zero sales people. Our in our entire organization, we have just one account manager. We are 25 people, and everyone else is product and engineering. So that's the basic background, in terms of phenomenal traction, I've been a senior entrepreneur myself. I've run previous companies. I'm telling you like the kind of traction, the kind of product market fit that I am seeing, and the speed at which it's growing, even I did not anticipate it like my goals for the next year are being met this year. That's

S Speaker 110:05the congrats on that. Sort of, those are some amazing milestones, for sure. I think when you say total contract value, that that's the total contract value over the multi year horizon that the contract is for, okay, Understood, understood, sort of maybe like taking that's that's incredible progress, and congrats on that, for sure, maybe taking a step back. Would love to unpack the product a little bit. What are you sort of building today? What is life today, and where's the broader vision? How do you see this evolving?

S Speaker 310:40Yes. So
S Speaker 113:13and sort of like maybe a quick follow up, you mentioned you don't have a sales team today, so how is, how are you landing some of these accounts? Is it mostly inbound? Is it through from founder LED? How are you doing? Yes,
and sort of like maybe a quick follow up, you mentioned you don't have a sales team today, so how is, how are you landing some of these accounts? Is it mostly inbound? Is it through from founder LED? How are you doing? Yes,

S Speaker 213:26yes. So it's a combination of founder LED and a very specific GTM channel. So what, what I did in my Ethan, and which was success for me in my previous startup as well. We partnered with two Fortune 500 system integrators, and what we did was we worked with them because their job is IT transformation. And both me and my co founder, Saurabh parulti, while we were building the solution, we spent 10 months talking to CIOs for Fortune 500 companies. One interesting insight that we got was 75% of the Fortune 500 companies, they rely on a system integrator for their key IT transformation and IT management decisions. So even if I go to them, ultimately, we have to work with these guys so we flip the switch completely. Yeah, makes sense. Okay, so the solution that we are offering is a unified IT ops incident resolution platform. It provides support for both employee productivity and experience, because employees can have it related issues. My laptop is not working, reset my password and hundreds of others you would face same in Qualcomm as well. And I'm sure you hate your ITT. The second aspect is the problems of it related to infrastructure. IT infrastructure which could be servers, which could be database, which could be network, which could be applications. If I am a CIO of a large organization, my responsibility is to make sure these incidents do not occur, or if these incidents are occurring, they are resolved as soon as possible. Right? So to a CIO, they are not two different problems. How do you solve them? Is different, but ultimately it's a unified a one fortune, 500 CIO, who is deploying our solution. His feedback to us was Saurabh. I've been the CIOs in Fortune 500 space for almost 30 years. I'm looking for such a solution for past 20 years. I'm glad that I can try it out in my organization now.

S Speaker 417:00So I just want to add a couple of comments. Okay, so the approach here is Sauron mentioned address it needs across the spectrum. Okay, today you would see somebody talking to the customers on, okay, let me solve your service desk problem as a product company, even within that like savor was mentioning, I will have my chatbot solution. Move on. Somebody will say, I'll give you a voice solution. Someone will say, I'll give you a ticket solution. But I as a customer, I have been in their shoes for many years to say, hey, I need to solve my problem, and all the channels are relevant for me. So we have built channel solutions, right? Every channel is addressed, okay? Second hypothesis is, it is not that it is a kind of misfit thing as up today, things could change in the 18 months that our goal to change it, we will have a set of autonomous solution which we call as virtual agents and a assisted solution for the human beings. We do both and feed that back into our autonomous solution. What I mean by that is, if somebody calls on a voice thing, our autonomous solution called Voice virtual agent handles it tries to troubleshoot, troubleshoot it. If it cannot right because of technology constraints and various other things that we have, it passes on the human agent with enrichment of that information. So the human agent gets started right off the bat and not repeat the same questions to the user and both them. But we also give what's called a voice agent Copilot to the human agent so they can solve their problem quickly. So it's a multi sorry, it's a hybrid approach of autonomous solution and a human assisted solution, and using the human assistant solution to feed back into an autonomous solution. So we start with like, you know, 25 30% autonomous resolution, and then push it way up to 80, 90% that's our proposal, our approach. Okay? And like you said, like Sarah was saying, No holistic solution. What has to be an incident, a human being will report, an employee will report, will finally, probably get resolved on the technical operation side, right? The an ax issue or a sick today, there is no solution that connects these two things. But I'm as a CEO CIO, I need to know why. Why are my employees reporting this thing? What's going on with my application? Or vice versa, my application monitoring people seeing some latency issue. When is it going to impact my manufacturing plan? That connection is what we call us. That you see the middle circle. We feed the data in between that and the last one I want to make the statement here is on the cop side, which is the, you know, what you see on the right side, similar hybrid approach. We have a virtual agent that handles all the tickets that is coming, whether it's coming from auditing tools, human created, or whatnot, if they cannot solve we have created copilots for the various expert groups. Okay, the ticket goes to a database engineer. Here you go. You have a database expert copilot. So that's been the approach.
So I just want to add a couple of comments. Okay, so the approach here is Sauron mentioned address it needs across the spectrum. Okay, today you would see somebody talking to the customers on, okay, let me solve your service desk problem as a product company, even within that like savor was mentioning, I will have my chatbot solution.

What I mean by that is, if somebody calls on a voice thing, our autonomous solution called Voice virtual agent handles it tries to troubleshoot, troubleshoot it. If it cannot right because of technology constraints and various other things that we have, it passes on the human agent with enrichment of that information. So the human agent gets started right off the bat and not repeat the same questions to the user and both them. But we also give what's called a voice agent Copilot to the human agent so they can solve their problem quickly. So it's a multi sorry, it's a hybrid approach of autonomous solution and a human assisted solution, and using the human assistant solution to feed back into an autonomous solution. So we start with like, you know, 25 30% autonomous resolution, and then push it way up to 80, 90% that's our proposal, our approach. Okay? And like you said, like Sarah was saying, No holistic solution. What has to be an incident, a human being will report, an employee will report, will finally, probably get resolved on the technical operation side, right? The an ax issue or a sick today, there is no solution that connects these two things. But I'm as a CEO CIO, I need to know why. Why are my employees reporting this thing? What's going on with my application? Or vice versa, my application monitoring people seeing some latency issue. When is it going to impact my manufacturing plan? That connection is what we call us. That you see the middle circle. We feed the data in between that and the last one I want to make the statement here is on the cop side, which is the, you know, what you see on the right side, similar hybrid approach. We have a virtual agent that handles all the tickets that is coming, whether it's coming from auditing tools, human created, or whatnot, if they cannot solve we have created copilots for the various expert groups. Okay, the ticket goes to a database engineer. Here you go. You have a database expert copilot. So that's been the approach.
So I just want to add a couple of comments. Okay, so the approach here is Sauron mentioned address it needs across the spectrum. Okay, today you would see somebody talking to the customers on, okay, let me solve your service desk problem as a product company, even within that like savor was mentioning, I will have my chatbot solution. Move on. Somebody will say, I'll give you a voice solution. Someone will say, I'll give you a ticket solution. But I as a customer, I have been in their shoes for many years to say, hey, I need to solve my problem, and all the channels are relevant for me. So we have built channel solutions, right? Every channel is addressed, okay? Second hypothesis is, it is not that it is a kind of misfit thing as up today, things could change in the 18 months that our goal to change it, we will have a set of autonomous solution which we call as virtual agents and a assisted solution for the human beings.

Someone will say, I have built a network management agent. Someone will say, I build a chatbot. That is not what the CIO is looking that is not the problem we are solving.

All that is stays there, but our goal is to go from UN another source is unstructured data right the surface, sitting on ticket, work notes, the stuff is sitting on chat. The stuff is sitting on Slack channels, the stuff is sitting on GitHub. So that is the second source. So structure is knowledge base, and all this is the other 1/3 is we obviously go into the public information and get it right, because Qualcomm has got the best support structure on like, what to do with your product. So we bring in that, an element of it. And the last, and the most powerful thing, is the how we take this from a human being, what they do, the task knowledge, and what's there in their head and how they do it is the most important, the holy trail of how we solving it from a technology standpoint. So going back to the copilot conversation and the autonomous solution conversation, keep in mind that the copilot was intentionally designed so that we'll be able to feed that back into our autonomous solution.

Because I was still customer, okay, chatbot, okay. I have service now. Okay. I have move works. These guys are road based what move works did in Gilead.

S Speaker 426:00I don't know whether we are the reason why ServiceNow is rethinking whether to buy who works for 3 billion, okay? Because that was the biggest client in Gilead. Okay, they announced and we kicked the lot, sorry to say it that way, but that's what we have built, right? Because as a customer, I'm not saying, okay, my voice contacts are happening. So should I go to a third company now for voice, okay, but by you know, I have a customer today that Sauron talked about this energy company, Kohler energy, very interesting thing, right? 80% of their contacts are through tickets. So what is movers going to do there? Yeah, nothing, right? I need to have a ticket work agents and ticket copilot. This is truly what is selling for us. And though, again, I mean, we limit ourselves to it. And Saurabh keeps correcting me, hey, limit ourselves to it. It kind of thing when it talks to VCs, particularly investors, because we have a disconnect on the problem we are trying to solve. When people see this views, customers are pushing us to HR. Customers are pushing us to because so they are saying, Hey, why can't you do this for HR? For me? Why can't you do this for my accounts payable, accounts receivable? Because my partners are calling. There is a big use case we are building for a client where vendor onboarding, why can't you do this for my vendors? Because I'm on boarding the 1000s of vendors

S Speaker 227:21across the world and Priyesh, to add to what Vicky has said, just taking Gilead as an example, we started with just one chatbot, one. Then they expanded to all. They are now onboarding all the channels on the end user. Then they said, Hey, can you do that for my procurement or vendor onboarding? So my initial insight, which was a POC, was 20k became, a, I think then they added 100k for procurement. Now they are saying for tech ops. If we had tech ops, that could be another half a million dollar added. So there is a our solution is such, once it lands on the customer environment, and once they once we start ingesting their data into our system, then magic starts happening. We don't have to sell customers, I'm telling you right now, the reason I would not even go to and raise the reason why I'm raising money is there is customers who are coming to us, sort of take ownership of everything, take this, and I need money for running that, because I need to predict for those five years. So that is the power of the solution.
across the world and Priyesh, to add to what Vicky has said, just taking Gilead as an example, we started with just one chatbot, one. Then they expanded to all. They are now onboarding all the channels on the end user. Then they said, Hey, can you do that for my procurement or vendor onboarding? So my initial insight, which was a POC, was 20k became, a, I think then they added 100k for procurement. Now they are saying for tech ops.

S Speaker 128:19Very, very interesting, sort of certainly fits our thesis as well. There is, I would say there is appetite within Qualcomm as well to adopt solutions like this. We are looking at aisre space. We are having some discussions with our CIO CISO teams on this. So I would love to float this around internally as well, and then see if there is an appetite for Qualcomm to sort of adopt a solution as well. But yeah, yeah.

S Speaker 428:45One more thing I just want to touch upon, see, I don't know, sort of even getting the details. See earlier, part of our journey started with customers saying, hey, I want to do because I'm concerned about my data going out. We are one of the few companies who came up with a self hosted model hybrid that has been a key, key winner for us. Now know that we have done that some customers will confident say, Hey, I am okay with your SAS model. So what's happening to southwest point he was talking about the 10 million versus 2 million deal. You know that right the moment I pass SAS through me, including my hardware and my token charges. It's a simple map, right? It is 7x for me now. Okay, so couple of brands, big retail brands, that you will see that we are deploying now, or we deploy next two months, we'll take our booking, or VR, or Mr. Whichever metric you do, at least 7x let

S Speaker 430:40we are solving the bigger problem, Priyesh. Priyesh, but the thing is, sorry I missed mispronouncing your name. Sorry about that. But here is the thing, right? Some of the early investors, to be honest, before we saw this level of traction, as in any new entrepreneurs who are trying to disrupt the market, were kind of saying, Harish, are you sure you can do this, right? But we said, if we solve these problems, the other problems become easy. I'm not saying we will buy while the ocean or we'll solve world hunger problem. We can solve this, okay? And this comes to this SRE thing, yes, I can solve the problem much easier. If you are a homogeneous client, okay, you are all your stuff on Azure, all your stuff on AWS. I can spin up an SRE any day. Okay, so this is a very different world that we are dealing with, and we are able to make progress. We are able to make progress, small progress, but leading to bigger and bigger progresses for us with more see. Other insight we are getting is see it is very rare for a company with eight months of existence of launching a product to be working with these kind of brands so the product market fit is established, but the enhancement of the product that is happening, the velocity at which is happening is phenomenal, because the insights are coming from the cry. Like Sauron said, we need money to make it more right, not for sales. We don't need money forward sales, right? It is more of making this thing. And the last comment is we saw in the structure we talked about multi model. I think that is where I wanted to see Qualcomm's interest. Also, I would be more, little bit more aligned. I want to highlight a point that it is a multi model, multi model, multi cloud approach, meaning you bring anything. Because we are working with large enterprises, self hosted model, we have to be flexible, right? They're on AWS bedrock, or they are on meta, whatever.

S Speaker 132:20So Qualcomm is multi, multi cloud. For sure. We have on prem deployments as well. We would have hundreds of micro services, probably 1000s of applications running. So certainly a very complex environment in that matter. But what looks like the solution can handle

S Speaker 234:01And Priyesh, you had touched upon the expert aspect. So I want to call out like one. And this is an example. One of our clients, they have SAP as their application, SAP, so our expert core result behind that, we have built a sap incident resolution expert agent behind that, and it is learning on the client's data. Another one, their entire databases on Oracle, using Oracle database, then another client, which I'm not deliberately not naming the client because of the specific infrastructure their regulated industry they have, their everything they have consolidated into promote Prometheus. So what is happening is, with every single deployment, the depth and the breadth of our solution is increasing. Our mode is increasing. The more they use, the more it becomes absolutely impossible for them to work without us.

S Speaker 134:50Yeah, understand that sort of super interesting. I would love to dig deeper. Okay, allow me to do a little bit more research on my end. Come back to you with some follow up questions. Would love to handle those async, and I will also loop in one more partner from our team who particularly looks at DevOps. It would either be Deepak or Tushar, and I would like to schedule a follow up call sometime mid next week with them as well. Sounds good and sort of would be great if you can. I think maybe the dog, the pitch version I have is not as detailed as this. I would love to go through some of the technical architecture.
