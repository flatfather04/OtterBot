S Speaker 11:39from? So I'm originally from India. Did a lot of entrepreneurship, early stage startup experience there. Then I moved to the US for my MBA, did my MBA from UCLA, and during those two years, was really invested in venture capital, worked with a lot of funds, did my last internship with Menlo Ventures. So that opened a lot of doors for me, and that's where, like, was very involved in the student ecosystem as well. So got a lot of Qualcomm investment folks come speak at panels at our institute, and that got me some connections internally. So when I saw these guys were hiring, reached out, and that worked out. Well, yeah, that's fantastic.

S Speaker 22:16Well, UCLA is a great school. My dad went there. He got his PhD. Oh, wow, in sociology, criminology, 100 years ago, you know kind of thing. But, yeah, no, that's, you know, great school. Great Great location, too. So well, if you ever want to start a company, let me know, because there's you guys. I imagine you built 10 you have a good technical skills to in the business stuff. And I'm pure business, so, but that's all right, yeah,

S Speaker 23:03for it? You know? I mean, I worked so I got probably more exposure to India, so from the outside investing. But when, when I worked at arm, and arm was acquired by Softbank, I was working as Chief of Staff to the CEO, right? And at that time, and Softbank was making a ton of investments during that time, and they were investing in oil and some of these other companies, right, really just took off right? And there's that, there's another weather, other ones, that was a big delivery company that really took off to

S Speaker 23:41Yeah, yeah, going 100 miles an hour, you know? And someone would pitch to masa San in Japan, and I happen to be there sometimes,
Yeah, yeah, going 100 miles an hour, you know? And someone would pitch to masa San in Japan, and I happen to be there sometimes,

S Speaker 13:50yeah. Well, that that's great experience. I see you also have an MBA that's, that's the stellar career graph that you have. I hope I can replicate some of that successes for myself.
yeah. Well, that that's great experience. I see you also have an MBA that's, that's the stellar career graph that you have. I hope I can replicate some of that successes for myself.

S Speaker 24:01Well, I don't, I wish I, you know, in hindsight, I didn't my my thing, my father's brother was an electrical engineer and super smart, and I never quite had that, those capabilities, so I kind of took the easy bath where I could in school and that that served me. Okay? I guess in hindsight, if I would have had more bravery, I think I would have tried for something in engineering, you know, or computer science, just because it opens up so much, you know, I feel like in hindsight, and you can even get your degree and not for use it again when you have that like, skill set, and you get, like, I call it the the tattoo. Like anybody who has a business degree and has a technical degree is like, 10 times more powerful than for the guy like me who's vanilla business, business, business, business, you know, accounting, business, kind of stuff. So, yeah,
Well, I don't, I wish I, you know, in hindsight, I didn't my my thing, my father's brother was an electrical engineer and super smart, and I never quite had that, those capabilities, so I kind of took the easy bath where I could in school and that that served me.

So, yeah,
S Speaker 14:45but that's interesting. You you've had such a wide variety of experiences. Well, how does now the transition into Qualcomm feel like, Well, are you, are you excited about it? Do you think it's more of a, I mean,
but that's interesting. You you've had such a wide variety of experiences. Well, how does now the transition into Qualcomm feel like, Well, are you, are you excited about it? Do you think it's more of a, I mean,
but that's interesting. You you've had such a wide variety of experiences. Well, how does now the transition into Qualcomm feel like, Well, are you, are you excited about it? Do you think it's more of a, I mean,
but that's interesting. You you've had such a wide variety of experiences. Well, how does now the transition into Qualcomm feel like, Well, are you, are you excited about it? Do you think it's more of a, I mean,
S Speaker 24:55it's a great, great question. So I, you know, one thing I noticed about Qualcomm, just across the board. You know, a lot of people will say this, but it's really true. There's a lot of smart people at Qualcomm, a lot of smart people, and they all seem to collaborate. Well, you know, we're in this transition phase because we're the first, or one of the first, true SaaS software platforms that's been acquired, and that's, you know, it's an operating business, and that's been a big challenge, frankly, for Qualcomm, for us, the integration phase, and we're working through that. And so we're all talking about that. BCG just involved in, you know, in a project as well, across the company. So I'm sure it'll work out. But that's the part that gets me excited. I'd love to see, you know, this company, this technology, you know, flourish and Qualcomm, because there's so many different ways that can really do well in a cool view. So, yeah, so, and I, yeah. So anyway, I think it's, I think welcome is amazing, you know. I think it's, you know, one thing I do observe, though, is there's a lot of processes that are completely old fashioned and slow things down. And, you know, given the diversification strategy. We, you know, and there's lots of acquisitions happening, but, you know, the key is often in the integration phase. And what do you do with it? Right? That's what part of it. And so we're, you know, we're gonna have to figure out how to bring some of these acquisitions together. They're too fast. And I think that part of that part sounds interesting to me, but my, yeah, my background was more on, you know, finance and operation, the buy side, but it's kind of expanded a little bit. You know, it's always been in the business side, but I would say it's generally kind of been in this operational space, not the product or the technology. But obviously, love working. I mean, one of the reasons I think, you know, I went back to MIT Sloan, was because even though I've never been an engineer, I've always worked with engineers, and I love the way they think. I don't think that way. I'm an analog guy, you know. I like to live in the gray, and engineers are no, no, you got to get in there. I'm like, what if, you know, it's like, it's a really different way of thinking and compartmentalizing, you know, and slicing problems in this stuff, you know. And really, I've seen it firsthand, and so I've always been fascinated by that way of thinking. And I like that. And usually, you know, smart engineers usually become creative leaders, not always, but they can.
it's a great, great question. So I, you know, one thing I noticed about Qualcomm, just across the board. You know, a lot of people will say this, but it's really true.

S Speaker 17:15So yeah, that's a very interesting thought. A lot of companies that we meet very openly, overtly, or to our face, say that Qualcomm's Developer Relation team is not as good. We don't have a software platform. So I hope edge impulse would probably change a lot of that. But I'm curious, will you being in the space with Edge impulse? And I'm sure you would meet a lot of developers, a lot of entrepreneurs. Are you very active in the startup ecosystem? How how do you think about that? Yeah,
So yeah, that's a very interesting thought. A lot of companies that we meet very openly, overtly, or to our face, say that Qualcomm's Developer Relation team is not as good.

We don't have a software platform. So I hope edge impulse would probably change a lot of that. But I'm curious, will you being in the space with Edge impulse?

So check sizes would be two to $15 million so so we can go late as well and see it. But most of most of the deals would be follow. About 80% of deals would be follow. Very rarely, we have led deals. And I think the more recently, the strategy has been to follow, not take more board seats, be a more participating investor,

So, you know, obviously, visited the IoT EU and that kind of stuff like that. Yeah. So it's great. I haven't ever been to the Santa Clara office yet, just because it's the commute from here is with traffic would be probably about an hour and a half.

S Speaker 112:43absolutely. So the ventures team is also mostly remote. We come to Santa Clara just on Mondays for one meeting where we, every one of us, come together discuss deals.

S Speaker 113:20certainly, for sure. For sure. Yeah, I'd love to do that. Let me have a chat with the team. I would love to set that up.

S Speaker 213:35yeah. And it's pretty exciting. What we're doing, we're working with other business units in coming up with different ideas how to package up, kind of what we have. It's been quite you know, the focus AI acquisition, it's fairly adjacent to what we do. Foundry is maybe a little bit more remote, but there's more acquisitions that are in the pipeline that we know about. There's a lot happening. So

S Speaker 113:59absolutely interestingly, inside the team, we have some partners focusing specifically on a few business unit areas, like someone is particularly invested in cybersecurity. Few folks look at AI. We do not have a very dedicated person focusing on edge AI. So that sort of runs between me and a couple of other partners, but always connected with the

S Speaker 215:25I mean, they're the SaaS model is obviously proven. I mean, you see people kind of moving back into usage base, but I honestly think for enterprise software, that's what we're in. And you have to be careful, because SaaS can mean a lot of stuff to a lot of people. You know, B to C, B to B, but true enterprise SaaS is really a specific area where you can generate significant value, especially if the product is in product and product market fit are kind of there, you know, it's just, yeah, absolutely tremendous. So happy to give you my views on that stuff,

So happy to give you my views on that stuff,
S Speaker 116:38of that, for sure. That's amazing, William. And I also want to check one more thing with you. A friend actually reached out for a role that I saw internally that you're hiring for. I think I can it's the SAS analyst position. I've worked with them for a year, and I can vouch for the dedicated Ness that they would bring for on the profile. And it seems like the job description is also fit for the profile. So in case, if you haven't sort of made a decision on there, would love to sort of,
