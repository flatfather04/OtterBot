you're the guy with the money. So obviously, you know, everywhere
S Speaker 10:40there are a lot of people with money over there. I can tell you, like, I see these crazy valuations right now, clear to me that lot of people with good, big pockets.

S Speaker 20:50Yeah, Okay, excellent. So, but I think in some ways, right so, you know Uncle Jay right of emergent ventures. Have you heard of him? I
Yeah, Okay, excellent. So, but I think in some ways, right so, you know Uncle Jay right of emergent ventures. Have you heard of him? I
Yeah, Okay, excellent. So, but I think in some ways, right so, you know Uncle Jay right of emergent ventures. Have you heard of him? I
Yeah, Okay, excellent. So, but I think in some ways, right so, you know Uncle Jay right of emergent ventures. Have you heard of him? I
S Speaker 11:00think I've heard of him. I don't remember him exactly. Let me look it up. Yeah, yeah.
think I've heard of him. I don't remember him exactly. Let me look it up. Yeah, yeah.

S Speaker 21:06He's my classmate from IIT. After that, he worked in Cisco, in a few places, then did his MBA from Wharton, remote, right? Like MBA and all. Then he started working at Bloomberg, capital, and came out and started this emergent one, okay, man, it was, yeah, it was not easy, like, in a way, like, you get the money from LPs and now you have to distribute, right? But it's on you. Now, where that I know even, like, a million dollars, right, it's still a lot of money, right? You're trying to do your best to allocate it the right way. So we had some good conversations, right? I know it's not an easy job.

S Speaker 11:51Yeah, that sounds interesting. I see Ankur is from UCLA. Maybe I should catch up with him. Yeah, you should wait uncle. Yeah, he's, he's both at Wharton, and I see he did an MS from UCLA. So, oh, MSMS, yeah, multiple Academy qualifications.
Yeah, that sounds interesting. I see Ankur is from UCLA. Maybe I should catch up with him. Yeah, you should wait uncle. Yeah, he's, he's both at Wharton, and I see he did an MS from UCLA. So, oh, MSMS, yeah, multiple Academy qualifications.

S Speaker 22:12That's right, that's right. So, but, but here's a very interesting thing that I've noticed, right, like, I've been in touch with some of these guys for last 10 years while I was doing my consulting, heading to the VC and all for them, the biggest break was even at a junior level, right? Picking one good company, okay, man, that completely changes the trajectory,
That's right, that's right.

Picking one good company, okay, man, that completely changes the trajectory,
S Speaker 22:38very good investment, okay, one, one jump that he found, yeah, yeah. And that completely changed his destiny. Like, you know, he get out of like, Bloomberg, and he knew enough LPS by then to show that look I know, I know how to look for, like, the right people, yeah. And that's it like now you see how many investments is made, right? I think about 30 investments, at least five or six exits, if not more by now. So he's doing very well. The other guy I know is the, I mean, it's a little more senior, like engineering capital guy, yeah, that you probably know him, right? I don't know Ash sudhana. So he came out of foundation capital. Used to work with a sugar of IIT Delhi, anyway, that the VC environment
very good investment, okay, one, one jump that he found, yeah, yeah. And that completely changed his destiny.

S Speaker 28:16this? No, I think this is great, and especially around that edge versus cloud, like, what's the thinking process there? I mean, as you know, I mean for us, the multi tenant architecture in the cloud, you know, really drives efficiencies, right? Yeah? Because we don't, like, I know, I met the spot guys, I forget now, whether they have a edge device,
this? No, I think this is great, and especially around that edge versus cloud, like, what's the thinking process there?

S Speaker 28:41so we don't, and this is by design, right? So our whole idea is there is enough computation capability on the cameras with a little bit of some AI, maybe not sufficient, but it's enough to reduce the overall bandwidth consumption, right? So with that, we are able to focus on our end to do a really outstanding, complex AI models in the cloud, which have access to infinite compute and infinite storage, right? So that is basically how we architected it. And anything we tried to do on prem, it's always limited, you know, by the amount of memory, and then the second is the amount of compute it has. And third, how often you upgrade the models, right? So, so it was a design choice to do it in the cloud, multi tenant, and keep it always fresh, right? So we release features, probably like no every week or every two weeks, we have something being released, including a lot of lot of this new gen AI stuff, right? So we just keep, like, adding it to our solution. If I have to ship it right as an appliance or even, like an on premise running software, yeah, the refresh cycle right is also longer and so. So there's reasons why we went this route. But does this affect your thesis? Like in terms of, you know, what we do?

S Speaker 110:06Not really. So having an edge play is not really a mandate for us to look at companies and we understand for various reasons. Sometimes an edge compute infrastructure makes sense. Sometimes it does not like you mentioned, sometimes going hybrid is a better strategy. Sometimes having an entire inference on cloud makes sense, and which is fine. A lot of times, a lot of edge companies that we invest in also have a very strong tech stack from Nvidia that they leverage. And those things are not really a detriment for us? Yes, internally for Qualcomm, looking at companies which might even down the line, have an edge play, could become our partners, is something that we look for, especially in like pushing through a strategic recommendation to the company. But it's not really a very big factor. It's not, certainly not a deterrent for us,

S Speaker 211:06to realize efficiencies, we may actually have an component. Okay? We do see the need in some cases. Yeah. The other one is privacy, right? If you have to put it in a hospital, I mean, we totally understand that, you know, they're ready to sacrifice some level of compute and accuracy and reliability to I just want nothing to go outside, right? If that is the case, we are happy to run it locally within their cloud. And this is going to happen a lot more as we go to our new segments, right? Which, which are more security conscious or privacy conscious, right? So, so that is something that we may do as part of our CDC outreach. But for now, I mean, we are ready to show, hey, the solution works okay, in a cloud setting, in a basically, it's all uses, the micro services are basically architecture so it can be easily packaged into a Docker container. It can move anywhere you want, right? And from a tech part, right? Again, very solid team, I think I was telling you, right? We have a faculty member from IIT Bombay who is our advisor, and he's bringing in lot of depth of, you know, talent to the team. But also, we have two patents already issued. The third one, you know, we are gonna file now, and fourth one is about to get started. So, I mean, we know enough about this space. We have acquired enough data to actually start working on it. So I think that should probably be a check mark there. I don't see a problem. And I think traction wise also, I think by q1 we should cross our million homes.

S Speaker 220:00So if you look at the sales cycle, the sales cycle could be like, you know, as little as probably a one month to maybe three months. And some of the big guys could be like, six months. And six month guys, typically, our ACV is in the 50,000 $200,000 per year range, right? So ACVs and on the low end, like, like, smaller deployments, the ACV could be about six to 10,000 but then we close that within a month, right? So, so and we have pretty good distribution, about, like, out of 25 customers, we have about 10 to 15 or in the smaller ACVs, about 1000 bucks a month to that is about 10 to 20k per year, right in that range. And we have about four or five that are more on the other side there, to 50k ACV right. And in the pipeline now we have a lot of these bigger ACV ones right now, once that sales cycle is done, like, the actual onboarding, it typically is a matter of, like, some of them are, like, on the low end is, like, literally one day onboarding, and some of them may take because there's some hardware involved, some installation involved, Yeah, it could be two weeks to one month, right? So that's the onboarding and installation time. Now, once that is done, the ongoing is just, you know, it's like SAS, and you just continue, and there is absolutely no, very little touch, I would say, after that, right? We have our customer success checkpoints, but otherwise nothing that really takes a long time. And this is where we are very different from, you know, work harder or spot or others where now you have to get first of all approval for this, 100k ACV, but also now you need to figure out when to go drop it off, install it within their network, you know, do a security check there. I mean, we have nothing to drop, right? So we just connect the, say, cameras to our cloud, and it's like ready to go. So in many cases for us, we don't have as much friction in closing. Sa, right? Yeah, it's more about demonstrating value, maybe doing a little bit of a small proof of concept. And between, again, my distribution has been between one month to about six months. And, you know, somewhere in the middle, I see a lot of them close right around three
So if you look at the sales cycle, the sales cycle could be like, you know, as little as probably a one month to maybe three months. And some of the big guys could be like, six months.

So if you look at the sales cycle, the sales cycle could be like, you know, as little as probably a one month to maybe three months. And some of the big guys could be like, six months. And six month guys, typically, our ACV is in the 50,000 $200,000 per year range, right? So ACVs and on the low end, like, like, smaller deployments, the ACV could be about six to 10,000 but then we close that within a month, right? So, so and we have pretty good distribution, about, like, out of 25 customers, we have about 10 to 15 or in the smaller ACVs, about 1000 bucks a month to that is about 10 to 20k per year, right in that range. And we have about four or five that are more on the other side there, to 50k ACV right. And in the pipeline now we have a lot of these bigger ACV ones right now, once that sales cycle is done, like, the actual onboarding, it typically is a matter of, like, some of them are, like, on the low end is, like, literally one day onboarding, and some of them may take because there's some hardware involved, some installation involved, Yeah, it could be two weeks to one month, right? So that's the onboarding and installation time. Now, once that is done, the ongoing is just, you know, it's like SAS, and you just continue, and there is absolutely no, very little touch, I would say, after that, right? We have our customer success checkpoints, but otherwise nothing that really takes a long time. And this is where we are very different from, you know, work harder or spot or others where now you have to get first of all approval for this, 100k ACV, but also now you need to figure out when to go drop it off, install it within their network, you know, do a security check there. I mean, we have nothing to drop, right? So we just connect the, say, cameras to our cloud, and it's like ready to go. So in many cases for us, we don't have as much friction in closing. Sa, right? Yeah, it's more about demonstrating value, maybe doing a little bit of a small proof of concept. And between, again, my distribution has been between one month to about six months.

S Speaker 123:43Well, that's good. That's good to know what kind of customers do you have currently? Or the you mentioned small ACVs and the larger ACVs. Is there any specific industries?
Well, that's good. That's good to know what kind of customers do you have currently? Or the you mentioned small ACVs and the larger ACVs. Is there any specific industries?

S Speaker 223:54Yeah, somehow we are getting very good traction from managed real estate. Okay, that's basically how can put it, both commercial and residential, where you hire a property management firm to take care of the security, right? So that has been working very well. So one of our customers is the stampa Housing Authority. There are about 33 buildings or communities with nearly 4500 units, okay, probably 10 to 15,000 people who live in those and so they are one of the biggest customers for us. We have a high rise in Sacramento, another housing community in Santa, Clara. So this, this, this is this part has been like, you know, showing a lot of interest. And we have some, you know, SMBs, like car dealerships, some construction sites and houses of worship. So we have that as another segment where we are getting some good traction. These are the guys, you

S Speaker 225:08I see he looked at the robots, okay? And we looked at drones, especially more than robos, the drones were of big interest to us, but unfortunately, the commercial deployment has been very, very slow, right? So,
I see he looked at the robots, okay? And we looked at drones, especially more than robos, the drones were of big interest to us, but unfortunately, the commercial deployment has been very, very slow, right? So,

I see he looked at the robots, okay? And we looked at drones, especially more than robos, the drones were of big interest to us, but unfortunately, the commercial deployment has been very, very slow, right? So,
S Speaker 225:28I mean, we just have not seen traction. We look at our customers to see, are we buying drones? You know, they all bought, like, one hobby drone, just to see, you know, how it works and has not taken out. Especially construction, there was a lot of excitement about using these drones that didn't work. And when you see the robots, like, you know, this night scope, or like cobalt. Cobalt literally was about to go bankrupt, and it was bought for pennies, okay? And there's another company this night scope. Think it's probably gonna declare bankruptcy any time, right? So, like, looks like all even these robotic dogs, we kind of looked at them, they just don't have the use case that really meet the needs, you know, so see, I mean, okay, I'll give you a very simple explanation for that, right, yeah, putting in camera, a camera cost probably 150 $200 okay, when you do it at scale, and you can just blanket, you know, an area like you put a camera, you can cover up 250 to 200 feet, okay, almost up to 120 degrees. Okay, so one camera connected to internet can cover such a large area that you just put like 10 cameras and incur maybe $20,000 cost. You're done, yeah, have no operating cost for the next five years. Whereas, if you have a robo now you have to charge that stupid thing. And every place it moves, it needs more battery, right? Now you put a battery on it, now it adds to the weight. So because you put more weight on it, you need to charge it even more, right? And by the time you get these things to charge right themselves, you are missing the coverage. See when it's getting charged, nobody's looking right. But you put a cameras $20,000 you're done. A Robo Dog cost you probably 5000 a other robos, they cost you $20,000 right? And it looks only what's in front of it, yeah, that is the reason why it never took off. So again, we explored, you know, as a good air company, tech company, we had to examine, you know, we have to see what's there, what's not there, what's useful. And we find anybody who invested in that area for security, if it's not related to defense, right? The only few companies that have survived or this and will, you know, right? UK armor guy. I mean, he gets probably money, even if he doesn't need it. So I think I have no idea what he's doing, how much effective it is, but just keep getting contracts, man. It's, I mean, defense is like a big hole any

S Speaker 228:52I met this company which has these tractors, but the way they are making it work is they give control to a human. So instead of sitting in the tractor, he just sits, you know, somewhere remote, and he just runs the tractor. I think that is doable, right? So you have more control. There is no extra, you know, autonomy you're building unnecessarily, right? So I think that seemed a little more useful, doable thing,
