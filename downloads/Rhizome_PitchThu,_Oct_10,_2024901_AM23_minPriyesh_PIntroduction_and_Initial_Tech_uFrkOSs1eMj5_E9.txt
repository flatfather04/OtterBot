S Speaker 20:55So Michelle, I think we got connected via Nick probably 15 months, 15 days back. And I guess the context back then was that you were raising a seed round, and we are broadly looking at the electrification space. Is the context still same? Are you still on the round? It has anything changed over there?

S Speaker 22:33So Michelle, maybe we can start by giving a brief background about the fund and Carlos and I can introduce ourselves. Or if you just want to keep it brief, if you want to start, if you have any other questions over there, we can do that. Or if you want to just dive into the pitch, we can do that as well. What do you suggest? Yeah,

S Speaker 13:07thanks, priyesh, and thank you, Michelle. I really appreciate you taking the time to chat with us, especially in not a perfect setting. So appreciate it. So we're the ventures and strategic investment arm of Qualcomm. Soon, you know Qualcomm, but if not, the phone you're talking from has a lot of our technologies, right? We're the world leader in wireless technologies over the past, say, 10 years or so, have become a significant force in application processor based solutions. With that. Combine that with, you know, wireless, we label ourselves as sort of a leader in driving smart, connected systems. You know, a lot of it, of this smart today is AI based, so we're big believers on AI on the edge as Qualcomm as a company, right? And we have big businesses, and obviously mobile, every cellular provider, phone provider, is a customer or licensee of ours. A lot of these technologies have morphed into multiple IoT applications, camera based, voice based, you name it. And then auto business is has become a big business for us again, the our solutions have found a home. And, you know, connected cars and digital cockpits and digital chassis and so on and so forth. So last big factor business for us is mixed reality and general sources. We were the world leader in technologies, into your Oculus, into the meta class, etc, etc. That's, that's all was behind the sort of the hardcore components, the complete communications is us, Qualcomm ventures. We basically been doing this for 24 years now. So we're a very mature, established organization. We've been very successful. Have had multiple unicorn exits in our history, and the reason we've been successful is we think and act like a financial investor. So even though we're strategic investor, we invest in companies that are relevant to us. We think and act like financial investors. So no no special terms, no special this special that we come in together with financial investors, we get out together with financial investors, we have very little things that we sort of ask that's different, typically in the form of a side letter, and, you know, very light touch. And one last thing is we are largely independent from the business unit. So the decisions, our decisions, are done within by us. They don't dictate deals that we should do, and we don't do deals that they want us to do. And and we can make decisions. There's no business agreements required, etc. So again, very successful platform. Obviously, AI has become a big horizontal so that's a big focus area. And more recently, a few of us in the team have started to look at what does climate tech mean for Qualcomm,

S Speaker 16:20at a first first pass. Clearly, electrification is, you know, very germane to us. Micromobility, very germane to us. So we made one investment last year in a company in San Francisco called spam, and we're looking to do one investment. So I'll stop here, sort of in terms of Qualcomm ventures. Quickly. Intro myself. I've been doing this for over two decades. I've been with Qualcomm for over 12 years. I run the Americas team today for us, and spend more of my time. I'm actually one of the driving forces behind our sort of climate interests within the team. So I'll stop here and let priyesh intro himself, and thanks again for your time.

S Speaker 27:04Thanks Carlos for the introduction. Mesh. I am a senior associate with the team. I joined the team about eight months back. I have a background in climate tech, so I've worked in renewable energy projects for about three and a half years, and then I pivoted into venture. I worked with Menlo Ventures and Morpheus in the past, currently working with Carlos on the electrification thesis of ours, and very specifically to rhizome. We are also looking at a few weather prediction models and downstream. How do they go on and create climate risk models? So when you talk about technology, that's also a very space that we would like to take a deep dive in.

7:42Okay, sounds good. I
S Speaker 37:45think that is pretty much a good overview. And then what stage you typically come in at, and how big is the fund, or is it off the balance

S Speaker 17:50sheet? So it's off balance sheet. We typically deploy 120 to 180 a year. So think of us as a $500 million fund. But again, it's an evergreen platform we've invested over life, you know, close to $2 billion and so, sorry, billion plus portfolio value as well over 2 billion so and we typically invest Series A, B and C. We do do seeds deals more sparingly than maybe in the past. And then we do, on occasion, do a series D, Series E, Series F, maybe for some specific reasons. But sweet spot is ABC, the issue check, typically from two to 10. And then, obviously, we, we like to continue to support the company, so long as we we believe in the story. You know, we tend and have the capability to write follow on checks.

We've found product market fit at a fairly you know, early stage, we've built our platform tailored specifically to utility regulatory and investment planning needs and and we've been hitting the market hard, we tend to find the right decision maker wherever we go. And it's it's kind of speaking to a major need that utilities have, especially since there's an enormous amount of regulatory pressure that's driving them to act,

S Speaker 114:05I apologize. I don't have anything to read from, so walk me again. How does your system work?

I apologize. I don't have anything to read from, so walk me again. How does your system work?
S Speaker 314:12So we ingest data from utility sector. We have pipelines to weather and climate data sets. We also have pulling in other geographic information as well, and we do really three major things with this data. First, we assess, we learn from historic data sets, what were the conditions during an outage that happened historically? What were the weather conditions and those hazards? What was the vegetation characteristic outside of the assets, what was the asset age and condition and what component types were actually failed that led to the outage. So these are all of the signals that we learn within our machine learning models. And when we actually train a model, we're able to project given hazards that are occur in the future, what's going to be the likelihood of failure, right? So the second piece of it is then coupling this model with climate projections to understand how the hazards are changing, and estimating what's going to be the impact of those hazards changing in the future. And then the last thing that we do is understand, you know, what's the consequence of a failure once it does occur, right? How many customers to this power? What the economic losses of it to get to the financial measures and loss that are required to generate cost benefit analysis for the investment the utility got
So we ingest data from utility sector. We have pipelines to weather and climate data sets. We also have pulling in other geographic information as well, and we do really three major things with this data. First, we assess, we learn from historic data sets, what were the conditions during an outage that happened historically? What were the weather conditions and those hazards? What was the vegetation characteristic outside of the assets, what was the asset age and condition and what component types were actually failed that led to the outage. So these are all of the signals that we learn within our machine learning models.

S Speaker 315:39Our implementation process has been shrinking with every customer that we add. So the first customer that we started working with and implementation, the model took nine months, and with the latest customer that we added, it's it's taking three months, and we're projected to take three months for the implementation. Now, if the if the utility is going to ask for, and we haven't had, we haven't had them ask for this yet, for direct integrations, if basically APIs with their systems, then those integrations will take a little bit longer to develop more resources from their IT team, but we don't anticipate that taking more than one to two months.

S Speaker 316:32So we have our engineering team that's building the pipelines into the data set and automating the machine learning pipeline that we've developed, and so that's why, that's what's driving most of the compression in gathering data. And any software company that works with utilities and build models are really going through this process, right? The key advantage that we have is that from an early stage, we're able to automate the ingestion of the data and the cleaning of the features and then the training of the bottles. So, so this is, you're right, that, like this exercise needs to happen with every new utility that we add, but we are building automations so that it requires not very much time from our engineering team to do now there, there is, you know, a little bit of work that happens when we kick off and we, you know, communicate what our data needs are to their IT team. We go back and forth a few times, and that's kind of implement between an implementation and customer success manager, type type of work that goes into that. But again, margins are fairly high because the contract values are approaching seven figures, and generally speaking, it's not that much work. Okay, got it

S Speaker 220:01Thank you. Priyesh, you have questions? Mish, yes, a couple of questions on the technology itself. We have come across a lot of companies in the grid maintenance, grid optimization, orchestration space, and all of them sort of use the usage outage, historical infrastructure data to create a digital twin of the grid. Do you think your differentiation comes from the fact that you are bringing in the economic variables in and doing the cost benefit analysis?

S Speaker 221:32Got it and speaking again, in terms of climate change, you mentioned you ingest a lot of weather data sets. Do you work on raw weather data sets to create your own projections?

S Speaker 321:49Yeah, so there's historical weather data so weather observation, weather re analysis, data, grid, med, gsod, error five, so on, so forth. There's also historical climate data sets as well. So that's from a historical perspective. Now you have then had data sets which are coupled models, 140 different models that have been developed that, you know, put together the IPCC report. We extract data from variants of those models depending on the geographic region, and we really characterize how the hazards are anticipated change given the combination of the historical data sets and the projected data sets. So with relation to, you know, any of the climate risk work that you've seen out there, and keep in mind that climate risk refers to climate projections, right? And you know, my co founder literally built the technology platform to run these models and high resolution through Drupal, so we have the expertise internally to have high build high confidence within the climate projections that we're actually building. Hey guys, I got to run over here, but feel free to follow up with with any other questions via email. But otherwise, you know, happy to stay in touch. I'll push you on the update list. Obviously, like, I think beyond being a jabbing platform that you have, there could be some strategic alignment. So maybe let's, let's aim to touch base sometime early in the next year, and it will give you a lot more information to play to the race. Good. Do
