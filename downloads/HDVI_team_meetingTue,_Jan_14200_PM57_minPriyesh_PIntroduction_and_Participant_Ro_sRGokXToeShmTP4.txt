S Speaker 14:22And good to see you. Quinn and and Tushar and Priyesh. Good to meet you. Yeah. Reed Spitz, co founder, and now the CEO of hdvi. Quick background, I was, I was an associate over at AVC back in 2015 to 2018 or somewhere in that kind of range focused a lot of my time on freight and logistics and supply chain, as well as financial services, and kind of built a little bit of a specialty in insurance, in property casualty insurance and commercial PNC. So basically, you saw an opportunity where those two huge industries come together. Freight and logistics is a $50 billion market annually, and commercial insurance is roughly the same. And, you know, nobody was really building a company at the intersection of those, something innovative in the insurance space for commercial auto and trucking. So that's, you know, we decided to to start with hdbi. I recruited Chuck into the business. Who was my co founder, who is my co founder, and was the CEO up until January 1. We transitioned on the first of the year. So, so I stepped into the CEO position, but played a lot of different roles at the company, CEO, Chief Product Officer, president and and now, now the CEO. So, so good. Anyway, good. Good to see you, meet you, and yeah, we're happy to, you know, first start with, I was thinking, just start with the overview of hdbi, and give you a sense of the business plan and what it is that we're what it is that we do. We can do that for like 30 minutes, and then pause for questions. Talk about the year ahead, the plans for 2025 go in any questions you have on the operating model, and take it

S Speaker 36:07from there. I think that sounds good. Reed as we spoke. The goal here is to reiterating it again, because Quinn joined after we spoke, is to understand the plan and how this is, how is hdbi setting itself for success executing the new plan.

6:24Cool, sounds good.
6:49I guess, check still involved in the company, or
I guess, check still involved in the company, or
I guess, check still involved in the company, or
I guess, check still involved in the company, or
6:51not anymore. Yeah,
S Speaker 16:52Chuck is still involved. He's the executive chairman, so he's still kind of, you know, an operating partner, if you will. Or, you know, he has some, some operational role in the company as well, and he's spending some of his time, you know, with other with other things now, but he's, he's still very involved with hpbi. So, yeah. So anyway, I will touch base on on all that. So that sounds good. So, and I'll breeze through some of this, because I'll just give, you know, some highlights and overview. Just to this is like a refresher on what we do generally, and then I'll dive into some details on, you know, this year and the plan going forward and and then, you know, past performance and so forth. But just to kick it off, you know, management team, we've got a really, really top tier team of of execs that span logistics, insurance and mobility, billion, you know, have built, you know, zero to billion dollar companies in in these industries, and have been a part of building billion dollar companies in these industries. So just a great set of company builders that that also come from really deep experience in trucking, some of our some of our leaders, namely our chief fund riding officer, Adam and our chief actuary, Todd, deep experience in the trucking insurance industry, but then just a great set of advisors With the company as well that we've got former CEOs of some of the top, top trucking insurance companies in the in the in the in the space. Dave Michaelson was the CEO of national interstate for 25 years. Bill camp ran progressives commercial auto business for 17 years. Dave Pierson Berg was the CEO of Canal, which is one of our competitors. So, just a really great team, just to get into, just like, the high level of the company, you know, founded in 2018 you know, just to, like, give a little bit of a color of of what we who we are, and what we do, we think of ourselves as a full stack MGA. So hdbi is a managing general agent, meaning we do everything that a full stack insurance company does. We manage the claims, we write the policy, we price and underwrite, we service the policies, we collect, we bill. You know, we do everything a full stack insurance company does. We We partner with Spinnaker, which is our fronting carrier for their licenses, so we pay them a 5% fronting fee for their licenses, and then we have a panel of reinsurers behind us that actually takes on most of the risk. So we take 5% of the underwriting risk, and then our panel takes 95% of the underwriting risk. Now, one question that I'll just mentioned here is for the last three or four years that panel has been exclusively Munich Re. So Munich Re specialty took the took the other 95% of the panel, and they had therefore, you know, 95% of the underwriting risk. This year, we have significantly diversified the panel. So on one one, we have a new treaty. It's an annual treaty, but we have a new treaty that includes Munich, Allianz, Hanover, New point Re and our captive so it's a much more diversified panel. And if we have $100 million of capacity with that panel, which is that's one major benefit to the business for a number of reasons, because a we have, there's this diversification, and, you know, we've minimized the concentration risk with any one partner and two, Munich exerted a lot of control over the business. We were basically starting to become like an underwriting arm of Munich respecialty. And you know, we didn't always see eye to eye on on some of the, some of the things that they, you know, that they thought, and that was really, in some ways, really constraining us, constraining our growth. And it did make for some challenges over the last couple years. So that is one major change of the business that we're really excited about in 2025 is having secured that diversified panel as far as the overall, just
Chuck is still involved. He's the executive chairman, so he's still kind of, you know, an operating partner, if you will. Or, you know, he has some, some operational role in the company as well, and he's spending some of his time, you know, with other with other things now, but he's, he's still very involved with hpbi.

S Speaker 113:09Yeah, correct. So revenue is a function of premium, but revenue is our commission on this premium, and 21% right now, actually, on this new on this new panel, I got it, it's adjusted to 19 and a half percent. So around
Yeah, correct. So revenue is a function of premium, but revenue is our commission on this premium, and 21% right now, actually, on this new on this new panel, I got it, it's adjusted to 19 and a half percent. So around

So the way that this industry works is you get a provisional commission, and then, depending on how the loss ratio develops, that can either go up or down over the course of time. So if you outperform your loss ratio, Target, the reinsurers will pay you some extra commission, and if you underperform, then they will claw back the commission, some of the commission they paid. Yeah. But anyway, you know, targeting a 60% loss ratio on 2024 so we're beating the industry by call it five to 10 points. I think we're really developing more into the mid 60s right now, but that's about a 10% Delta better than the industry average of about a 75

We have today about 4 billion, I think that number is actually about 6 billion miles now of driving data and a run rate of about 10 million, 10 billion miles a year. And I'll talk about what we do with all that data, for, you know, actuarial purposes and segmentation and pricing and everything. So that's kind

S Speaker 115:15Yeah, absolutely, yeah. Loss ratio is insurance speak for how many dollars of premium. So when you collect premium, you obviously reserve some of that for paying claims. And so the loss ratio is, how many pure dollars of premium Are you paying out as expressed as a percentage, how many claims dollars are you paying out as expresses as $1 percentage of premium? So for every dollar of premium, we're paying about 60 cents in claims. The industry average is about 75 cents in claims. And then there's other operating expenses. That's the operating ratio, which you add on top of that, and then that gets you your combined ratio. So if your combined ratio is under 100 that means you're profitable, and your combined ratio is over 100 then you're unprofitable. So, so, so that is just the overall high level. You know, I'll just briefly touch on this slide. But this is kind of why we started the company, and it's because trucking insurance and Commercial Auto is really challenged and is a really struggling business. The combined ratio, as I mentioned, just mentioned, the combined ratio has been as an industry, in 100 510% range for the last decade. So it's, it's a really tough line of business for the incumbents, and in we, you know, our philosophy on that is that insurance companies have really struggled to get their hands around the risk and leverage new sources of data so so that's basically insurance companies have used one major tool to to get profitable, which is raise rates. And then when you look at what's gone on in the trucking industry, these are really thin margin businesses, three to 5% operating margins in good years, it's been a really, really tough freight market. A lot of them have gone out of business. So insurance companies, you know, their insurance has risen by 45% over the last decade, and that has just ballooned from a line item that used to be, you know, an important consideration, to one that is now like a life or death decision for the business. So our core value proposition of putting control of your insurance costs back in the hands of the insured with our product, with our telematics based product, is one that really, really resonates with the market and people see as really the future of Commercial Auto. And then we obviously, we also use software to drive a lot of efficiency in the in the business, in the way that we intake submissions and loss runs and claims handling and so forth, so, so driving efficiency, not just in the overall loss ratio, but also in the expense ratio, because the the tech enables us to Scale and lower employee base. So that's, that's that on, on this, just hand, touch, yeah,
Yeah, absolutely, yeah. Loss ratio is insurance speak for how many dollars of premium. So when you collect premium, you obviously reserve some of that for paying claims.

are they? Do you know this scale at which nirvana is at?
are they? Do you know this scale at which nirvana is at?
S Speaker 119:11Yeah, Nirvana is scaled really quickly. They're about double our size. They're probably around 100 million in grocer and premium. Whereas, you know, we ended up the year about 50, they've ended, you they're here. They want to say around 100 for cops and such. They just raised a round from Lightspeed and general catalyst and valor. I think that was a really, you know, solid round of financing. So, so they're doing really well. And people are looking at them as a as a real, you know, as doing well in this space. And obviously we're head to head with them, and we think we're doing pretty well too. So, yep, so you know, I'll keep this brief, but again, you know, we focus on trucking five to 99 power units is the sweet spot. You know, flexibility in our target appetite. We're actually expanding up to 200 power units this year. So that's one of the ways that we're is a growth lever for us, is writing larger fleets. And we've, we've kind of, that's one of the ways in which uncap, you know, kind of moving away from Munich is our sole reinsurer, is has allowed us to kind of lift that, lift that cap. So we're excited about that move. You know, really the core thesis of the company, or one core thesis, was in 2018 the federal government mandated that class eight trucks in the United States have what are called electronic logging devices. And this was really one of the core theses between behind Qualcomm's investment is the IO is really the IoT tie in here, because a lot, obviously a lot of Qualcomm chips are on these devices. But companies like Sam Sarah keep trucking and Geotab and in in Metro nine and like all these, all these new telematics companies basically were started being mandated by the federal government. So virtually overnight, like within the course of a year, millions of Class A trucks in the United States became connected IoT devices with really rich streams of data coming off those trucks. So we get a data ping every 10 seconds from from every one of our insured trucks that gives us a packet of information on, like, geolocation, speed, time of day, hours of service, status, harsh events. And then we, you know, and then we pair that with third party information to get, like road type and even weather and traffic, so that, you know, we can do really rich segmentation on, on the underwriting and pricing, so it's a lot of who's
Yeah, Nirvana is scaled really quickly. They're about double our size. They're probably around 100 million in grocer and premium. Whereas, you know, we ended up the year about 50, they've ended, you they're here. They want to say around 100 for cops and such.

And then we, you know, and then we pair that with third party information to get, like road type and even weather and traffic, so that, you know, we can do really rich segmentation on, on the underwriting and pricing, so it's a lot of who's
S Speaker 221:42responsible to give you this data. Is that the fleets themselves? Or are you partnered with samsara?
responsible to give you this data. Is that the fleets themselves? Or are you partnered with samsara?
responsible to give you this data. Is that the fleets themselves? Or are you partnered with samsara?
responsible to give you this data. Is that the fleets themselves? Or are you partnered with samsara?
S Speaker 121:49Yeah, we, we are partnered with Sam Sarah. The fleets themselves have to authorize it, so that is a very first step in our underwriting process. Is we will send a link to a fleet, they will click that link, and then when they authorize, it will basically be a single sign on to their telematics provider. And then when they click Authorize, we ingest their telematics data. So one of the cool things that we're doing is we're actually ingesting three years worth of historical telematics data now with every single submission. And so that is how we're, like, rapidly accelerating our tele the amount of telematics data that we're gathering, because we're pulling three years of historical data, really rich data on every 10 seconds of every truck. And then we're actually we're also getting the loss run information, which we're scanning in now using AI. And so we're getting these AI generated loss runs and these historical telematics data, you pair those together, and you that's where you get really, really rich information on telematics factors that lead to frequency and severity of loss and allows, basically, it's this, it's this learning engine that is much more rapid, basically, Much, much more rapidly enables you to learn in insurance than the historical, you know, carriers who basically do this by running a program for five years, seeing how the claims develop, and then, you know, adjusting their book of business. So it's it's also a lot more cost effective way to to learn how to kind of price and underwrite using telematics. So anyway, I'm getting a little long winded, but, but that's the that's the market. Let's see. I mean, this is, this is just what we kind of a core thesis, or, I mean, this is, like, the center point of of our strategy. This is our strategy, really, as a company. You know, there's the we leverage telematics throughout the the entire customer life cycle. So so we use it a on the front end to price to price risk. So we, and I'll go in. I have a few slides on how we do that, but we offer up to a 20% discount for the best leads based on their telematics scores. So we probably we're out. We're out pricing the competition based on telematics. We use it to select risk, so we can see in high definition which risks are more risky or less risky, based on the characteristics that we see within the telematics which is unique to us. We we use it to manage and monitor risk growth policy and provide safety and insurance insights for the fleets on how they can save money. We manage claims using the fleets like first we get first notice the loss based on the telematics, and then we're using camera data to basically make it easier to handle the claims and much more accurate claims handling and reserving, and then and then fleet retention, using the telematics to just automate a lot of the processes and make it really low touch for the fleets and give them a product and experience that they really enjoy. And then at the center of that all is that compounding data advantage, which is really unique to us because of what we have figured out in terms of, you know, how to collect data in this space. Um, you know, we're just running really far ahead of the competition now in terms of just how much data we're collecting and the advantage that gives us for what we can do with all these kind of five areas, pricing, underwriting, risk management, claims and retention. Um, so, um, you know, this is just a, kind of a look at the under high definition underwriting. We we think about this is how we think about underwriting in this space. We look at risk in high definition. So, you know, we kind of think about this like the traditional, traditional insurance companies are looking at the picture on the left. Hdbi is looking at the picture on the right. So you know, there's different risk characteristics that an underwriter would be looking for when underwriting a risk you know, what are they driving? Who's driving? It, where, when, how much. And so let's take you know who is driving. A traditional company might look at NVRs as a as an example, Motor Vehicle records, well, 80% of mvrs are going to be clean. So you might have drivers that are not good drivers, but show up clean on an MDR, whereas we're taking rich telematics data, and we can actually see which drivers are harsh events speeding are really not good drivers on the day and day out basis, or take routes as a for instance, we can see every mile that every truck has driven over the last three years, whereas our competitors look at just a map of where those trucks were inspected, which trucks, on average, are getting inspected once every six months or so. So they get this really, really, you know, not granular view of of the risk. So we use that all just to select the risk on the pricing piece. We have a dynamic pricing product called HPV. I shift and safety look back is our proprietary basically process for ingesting data up front. So we started with, we started with hpbi shift, which is a monthly dynamic pricing policy. So basically, however fleet, so if a fleet drives, let's take an example of like a $500,000 policy. Let's call it like a 50 year fleet. They they're in starting on January 1, depending on how, how safely they drove in January, they could start to save money on their policy in February, and then march and then April, based on their safety. So it's real time responsive. The pricing is real time responsive to the safety, up to 20% discount. So we started with hdbi shift. Now we have safety look back, which basically starts the fleet at the tier, at the, you know, appropriate price based on how they drove over the last three months. So we're so we're incorporating that telematics based pricing up front. Let's see
Yeah, we, we are partnered with Sam Sarah. The fleets themselves have to authorize it, so that is a very first step in our underwriting process. Is we will send a link to a fleet, they will click that link, and then when they authorize, it will basically be a single sign on to their telematics provider. And then when they click Authorize, we ingest their telematics data. So one of the cool things that we're doing is we're actually ingesting three years worth of historical telematics data now with every single submission. And so that is how we're, like, rapidly accelerating our tele the amount of telematics data that we're gathering, because we're pulling three years of historical data, really rich data on every 10 seconds of every truck. And then we're actually we're also getting the loss run information, which we're scanning in now using AI. And so we're getting these AI generated loss runs and these historical telematics data, you pair those together, and you that's where you get really, really rich information on telematics factors that lead to frequency and severity of loss and allows, basically, it's this, it's this learning engine that is much more rapid, basically, Much, much more rapidly enables you to learn in insurance than the historical, you know, carriers who basically do this by running a program for five years, seeing how the claims develop, and then, you know, adjusting their book of business. So it's it's also a lot more cost effective way to to learn how to kind of price and underwrite using telematics. So anyway, I'm getting a little long winded, but, but that's the that's the market. Let's see. I mean, this is, this is just what we kind of a core thesis, or, I mean, this is, like, the center point of of our strategy. This is our strategy, really, as a company. You know, there's the we leverage telematics throughout the the entire customer life cycle. So so we use it a on the front end to price to price risk. So we, and I'll go in. I have a few slides on how we do that, but we offer up to a 20% discount for the best leads based on their telematics scores. So we probably we're out. We're out pricing the competition based on telematics. We use it to select risk, so we can see in high definition which risks are more risky or less risky, based on the characteristics that we see within the telematics which is unique to us. We we use it to manage and monitor risk growth policy and provide safety and insurance insights for the fleets on how they can save money. We manage claims using the fleets like first we get first notice the loss based on the telematics, and then we're using camera data to basically make it easier to handle the claims and much more accurate claims handling and reserving, and then and then fleet retention, using the telematics to just automate a lot of the processes and make it really low touch for the fleets and give them a product and experience that they really enjoy.

S Speaker 327:58just, just for this audience, are most of the policies are yearly policies, or from the trucking side,
just, just for this audience, are most of the policies are yearly policies, or from the trucking side,
just, just for this audience, are most of the policies are yearly policies, or from the trucking side,
just, just for this audience, are most of the policies are yearly policies, or from the trucking side,
S Speaker 128:05they're all annual policies. So yeah, just like personal auto, actually personal auto often works in six month policies, trucking is annual, and they're all shopped pretty much every year. So unlike personal auto, where you might not shop, or you might shop whenever you kind of see an advertisement or feel like you might be getting ripped off by your insurance company. These policies are genuine, generally shopped every single year, which means it's good for us, because it means there's an opportunity to go after that business on an annual basis, based on their policy renewal date. So you know, very quick here just to touch and go on this we, this is just a slide that talks about the advantage of telematics in our pricing. So I'll start with the right hand side, which is, you know, basically when you bucket fleets into, you know, a telematics based like A, A, B, C, D and E, A bucket A being the best drivers and E being the worst drivers. And you basically have a normal distribution across those buckets. Our expected crash rate is basically the the predicted crash rate per bucket is the blue line. Is the dark blue line there, and then our actual experience on our actual claims over the last two or three years is that, like lighter blue line. So basically, there's a really strong fit between what we've predicted the claims to have been by by bucket and what the claims actually have been just validates, basically that our model is highly accurate and predictive, which means that you know that obviously is very promising good for our good for our loss ratio results. Another you know thing that we've observed, basically, is that when we have telematics data up front, within a policy. So when we get safety, look back, we are or when we renew a policy because we have their telematics prior, we are 15 to 2010, to 15% better on a frequency basis with those accounts than if we just write a policy without the telematics data. We used to write policies much more frequently without getting that telematics data up front. And so one thing, one way to really think about that, is that it eliminates the New Business Premium Tax in insurance. This is sort of an insurance I don't know new nuance, or industry fact, or whatever you want to call it, but there's a trade off between growth and loss ratio in insurance. So you could grow really, really fast, but the very likely, you know, if you're going to do that, you're very likely to have a very high loss ratio, because you have to take business from from other people. So generally, the way you're going to do that is by underpricing the policy. Is selling something that's worth $1 and selling it for 90 cents. But if you want to grow in insurance and not blow up your loss ratio, the best way to do it is to out segment the competition and take their business that they don't understand is not appropriately priced. So we are basically eliminating that New Business Premium Tax by using telematics up front and and using that in ways that the traditional competitors aren't using it. I'll go with like, one or two more slides and then just round it out, because I think these are, these are pretty touch and go slides. But you know, in addition to the pricing and underwriting that we do, we also have a rich set of tools for the insurance for the insureds, that enables them to see their their some safety data specifically as it ties to their insurance. So we allow that, because of the dynamic pricing, we allow them to see what their rate is each month, what their rate is projected to be on the following month, and then drill down to the driver level and see which are the drivers that are actually impacting their insurance costs the most. And then what are the driving behaviors that those drivers are exhibiting? So they can see things like speeding events, harsh events, time of day, and that allows them to coach their drivers to, you know, to safer or less risky behaviors. So this is something we've been developed. We've developed over the last, you know, four or five years of safety
they're all annual policies. So yeah, just like personal auto, actually personal auto often works in six month policies, trucking is annual, and they're all shopped pretty much every year. So unlike personal auto, where you might not shop, or you might shop whenever you kind of see an advertisement or feel like you might be getting ripped off by your insurance company.

Another you know thing that we've observed, basically, is that when we have telematics data up front, within a policy. So when we get safety, look back, we are or when we renew a policy because we have their telematics prior, we are 15 to 2010, to 15% better on a frequency basis with those accounts than if we just write a policy without the telematics data. We used to write policies much more frequently without getting that telematics data up front. And so one thing, one way to really think about that, is that it eliminates the New Business Premium Tax in insurance. This is sort of an insurance I don't know new nuance, or industry fact, or whatever you want to call it, but there's a trade off between growth and loss ratio in insurance. So you could grow really, really fast, but the very likely, you know, if you're going to do that, you're very likely to have a very high loss ratio, because you have to take business from from other people. So generally, the way you're going to do that is by underpricing the policy. Is selling something that's worth $1 and selling it for 90 cents. But if you want to grow in insurance and not blow up your loss ratio, the best way to do it is to out segment the competition and take their business that they don't understand is not appropriately priced. So we are basically eliminating that New Business Premium Tax by using telematics up front and and using that in ways that the traditional competitors aren't using it. I'll go with like, one or two more slides and then just round it out, because I think these are, these are pretty touch and go slides. But you know, in addition to the pricing and underwriting that we do, we also have a rich set of tools for the insurance for the insureds, that enables them to see their their some safety data specifically as it ties to their insurance. So we allow that, because of the dynamic pricing, we allow them to see what their rate is each month, what their rate is projected to be on the following month, and then drill down to the driver level and see which are the drivers that are actually impacting their insurance costs the most. And then what are the driving behaviors that those drivers are exhibiting? So they can see things like speeding events, harsh events, time of day, and that allows them to coach their drivers to, you know, to safer or less risky behaviors. So this is something we've been developed. We've developed over the last, you know, four or five years of safety

S Speaker 433:44and also some color around I went back to our files way back from 2020 the projection growth was much, much higher than what where we're looking at today, yep, but what like I haven't been tracking closely what things that didn't go well or whatever, like I don't, Yep, yeah.
and also some color around I went back to our files way back from 2020 the projection growth was much, much higher than what where we're looking at today, yep, but what like I haven't been tracking closely what things that didn't go well or whatever, like I don't, Yep, yeah.

S Speaker 134:07I mean, that's a, that's a super good question. Let me start there, and then I'll talk about, and I want to correct one thing you said, Marcia, which is our 2025, projection. But, yeah. I mean, our historical growth has, frankly, not been, has not been what I what we, what we wanted it to be or, I mean, it's been solid, like it's, it's pretty decent, solid growth for insurance. But when you look back to our 2020, projections, I think we would, probably would have projected to be several 100 million in premium by now. Um, we're sort of definitely off way, way off of that. Um, there have been a number of major, factors that I think have led to that one, one of which has just been the concentration with Munich and the challenges there, I would say second is just, is just the reality in the fundamental, the fundamentals of insurance and the, You know, the our focus on profitability has been, you know, has been really high. Our target loss ratio is a 60, which is again, like 10 to 15 points better than the industry. So to grow like 100% or more year over year. Well, beating the industry by 10 to 15% on the loss ratio is to say really, really challenging is an understatement. I would say just is, like incredibly challenging, probably more realistic, and so and so we have really been focusing on the profitability of the business, which makes us, in the long run, a much more attractive business to potential acquirers, because you know, if you know they want to know that this, that this mousetrap that we build actually produces profitable premium. It doesn't really matter to to them if we can write hundreds of millions in premium, but, but it doesn't produce profitable results, which is what we have seen within the InsurTech landscape, in sort of InsurTech, 1.0 or 2.0 depending on how you look at it. With the lemonades and hippos and roots of the world, when they kind of went public in the 2020, era, they had written, you know, half a billion dollars in premium, but we're still, you know, had loss ratios that were well way worse than the industry average there and the public markets really, you know, really, really punish them for it. So it's, it's really important to have a good loss ratio, and we have really focused on that and the profitability. There's always that trade off and the pressure to grow, especially when you're a venture backed company, you need scale. You need, you know, you need EBITDA. You need to get to EBITDA profitable. And you need to do it with profitable underwriting results. So we've always been kind of, you know, trying to thread that needle 2022 I mean, I don't have the historicals up in front of me. I don't know if, I mean, maybe Paul could flash them up if you want, but I think, I mean, the general growth rate has been, as I said, roughly 6 million in premium in 2022
I mean, that's a, that's a super good question. Let me start there, and then I'll talk about, and I want to correct one thing you said, Marcia, which is our 2025, projection. But, yeah.

It's more like 1.5x it's more like a 50% growth rate, or so a little bit less than that, actually, because we're at 53 million, going to 75 million. So it's not crazy growth, it's solid growth. I would say it's definitely fast growth, but it's not, it's not like 100% or 200% growth. So, so anyway, and then, how are we planning on doing that? I mean,

S Speaker 143:30grocery premium. So we had, like, we were in talks with, we had a couple of talks over the summer with a couple of companies that were really, really interested in potentially acquiring us. We so we had Series C conversations that evolved into M and A conversations, and the ballpark range valuation that was kind of getting discussed was in the call it 100 million dollar ballpark at a 50. So we were a $50 million book, so roughly 2x and when you look at this structure of this round, right, with a $90 million cap, it's most of the 1.5 which is obviously built in, you know, built in upside for the investors, the insiders and everybody coming in on this round. So it's definitely at the low end of that range, so investor friendly. But I think the out, the exit, the exit opportunities, are probably, you know, could land somewhere in that range. And you know, the better you're performing, loss ratio, growth and everything. You know, two and a half, two at 3x something like that, is reasonable to think they're gonna just raise theirs at like, a 6x GWP, so or more, or something like that.

S Speaker 144:47Yeah, those m&a opportunities didn't quite materialize. We were really far down the path with a couple companies, Hartford and travelers were something and we were talking to and they didn't quite materialize. But you know the plan, basically, the plan of this financing, is finance the company on, you know, really, frankly, good terms for the for the existing cap table. You know, people see a win here, a win, a successful financial outcome for for all the parties around the table. But it's, it's put about 18 months of cash into the company so that we execute really hard over the next year, and then go back out in a year and go talk to some of those same folks that we talked to, and probably a broader set as well in M and A conversations as well as be, you know, have the profile of a later stage company with about half the burn rate that we went out to on The Series C, and can kind of run a dual track process that we think will will land very successfully in about a year from now, plus hopefully the markets will be in a better place when we go back out. So that's really the thinking on the right. So

But it's, it's put about 18 months of cash into the company so that we execute really hard over the next year, and then go back out in a year and go talk to some of those same folks that we talked to, and probably a broader set as well in M and A conversations as well as be, you know, have the profile of a later stage company with about half the burn rate that we went out to on The Series C, and can kind of run a dual track process that we think will will land very successfully in about a year from now, plus hopefully the markets will be in a better place when we go back out. So that's really the thinking on the right. So
Yeah, those m&a opportunities didn't quite materialize. We were really far down the path with a couple companies, Hartford and travelers were something and we were talking to and they didn't quite materialize. But you know the plan, basically, the plan of this financing, is finance the company on, you know, really, frankly, good terms for the for the existing cap table. You know, people see a win here, a win, a successful financial outcome for for all the parties around the table. But it's, it's put about 18 months of cash into the company so that we execute really hard over the next year, and then go back out in a year and go talk to some of those same folks that we talked to, and probably a broader set as well in M and A conversations as well as be, you know, have the profile of a later stage company with about half the burn rate that we went out to on The Series C, and can kind of run a dual track process that we think will will land very successfully in about a year from now, plus hopefully the markets will be in a better place when we go back out. So that's really the thinking on the right. So
S Speaker 445:54let's see a year from now. Read your be 75 GMB, if somebody would have wanted to buy it sounds like maybe two and two and a half X on the 75 roughly, yeah, I
let's see a year from now. Read your be 75 GMB, if somebody would have wanted to buy it sounds like maybe two and two and a half X on the 75 roughly, yeah, I
let's see a year from now. Read your be 75 GMB, if somebody would have wanted to buy it sounds like maybe two and two and a half X on the 75 roughly, yeah, I
let's see a year from now. Read your be 75 GMB, if somebody would have wanted to buy it sounds like maybe two and two and a half X on the 75 roughly, yeah, I
S Speaker 146:06think that's a reasonable, like, ballpark estimate of where you, where you, where you could think the valuation is

think that's a reasonable, like, ballpark estimate of where you, where you, where you could think the valuation is
S Speaker 446:11reasonable, okay, okay. And then around, structured as pay to play, if I remember right,

S Speaker 146:17it's a pay to play convertible, no, pay to play, yeah, okay.

It's a note with a cap, but pay to play $90 million

S Speaker 446:34okay, and then the pay to play side. How is it calculated based off fully diluted ownership? Or how is it roughly calculated? Yeah,
okay, and then the pay to play side. How is it calculated based off fully diluted ownership? Or how is it roughly calculated? Yeah,
okay, and then the pay to play side. How is it calculated based off fully diluted ownership? Or how is it roughly calculated? Yeah,
okay, and then the pay to play side. How is it calculated based off fully diluted ownership? Or how is it roughly calculated? Yeah,
S Speaker 146:43it's on fully diluted ownership. So basically, everybody's ownership is getting converted to common at first. So obviously that's, you know how to pay to play works. Everybody gets converted to common. And then on a fully diluted basis, there's a there's the pro rata amount that you can step up and get back into the preferred. And then there's all kinds of, there's, there's a lot of incentives for being in the preferred, beyond just being in the preferred, which so there's a 1.5x like pref that comes in the preferred. There's a common warrants kicker that comes into the preferred. So for every dollar you invest in into the round, you get 25 cents of free comment, basically on top of the preferred and then there's even kickers for doing super pro rata of preferred warrant kickers of 25% up to 200% pro rata. So that that's basically the
it's on fully diluted ownership. So basically, everybody's ownership is getting converted to common at first. So obviously that's, you know how to pay to play works. Everybody gets converted to common. And then on a fully diluted basis, there's a there's the pro rata amount that you can step up and get back into the preferred.

So that that's basically the

S Speaker 148:25There's a $15 million minimum for the first close. And we have that committed. So that's so that's all in, and we're good there. The major investors on the first close are the four leads, which are Weatherford capital, ATC, Munich, RE and auto tech ventures, each of them are stepping up with roughly a $4 million investment. The exception is auto tech, which is doing 2.7 they were, they're like a really early stage company, and, or shouldn't say really early, but they're kind of seed Series A, some series B. This is a bit late for them, and their fund was deployed, but they wanted to get into this lead lead position on the round too, so that so that's our four kind of CO leads on around.
There's a $15 million minimum for the first close. And we have that committed. So that's so that's all in, and we're good there.

So that makes up to 15 basically, yeah,
So that makes up to 15 basically, yeah,
S Speaker 149:11that gets us to like 14.8 and then we've got a couple of other smaller checks coming in that are on the cap table as well that are getting us over that $15 million close hurdle.
that gets us to like 14.8 and then we've got a couple of other smaller checks coming in that are on the cap table as well that are getting us over that $15 million close hurdle.

Okay? Are you closing this week or next week? We haven't
S Speaker 149:25set the close date yet, but really I am soft circling next week, and we need to. We the board needs to nail that down. But I would say next week or potentially early the following week is reasonable. But, yeah.

So on average for 25 Yeah, about 1.5
So on average for 25 Yeah, about 1.5
S Speaker 150:03Well, let's be quick, but let's explain the component parts of that. Yeah, because it's important to understand the component parts of the burn. Yeah, yeah. From

Well, let's be quick, but let's explain the component parts of that. Yeah, because it's important to understand the component parts of the burn. Yeah, yeah. From
S Speaker 550:11an operation perspective, which is really what we addressed, I think you guys are familiar with what we did relative to the riff. And you know, we basically took out 30% of the salaries in the company. So operationally, it's about $780,000 down from an excess of a million. So we really cut the operational burn, but that we do have collateral requirements for every insurance agreement that are factored into this. And so that adds a little bit more to the total aggregate burn, but the average dramatically. It's

And so that adds a little bit more to the total aggregate burn, but the average dramatically. It's
S Speaker 150:41important to distinguish. So we took our operating burn down to, like, 1.1 million, down to about 750k then there's this other cash flow that goes out of the business, which is our collateral requirements for the slide. Basically, that cash just gets locked up for two years. And then if we perform, you know, two, three years, if we perform on the loss ratio, we get it back, but it just we can't touch it for a while. So we kind of count it as operating burn, because it does eat into the operating expense, or whatever the overall cash position of the
important to distinguish. So we took our operating burn down to, like, 1.1 million, down to about 750k then there's this other cash flow that goes out of the business, which is our collateral requirements for the slide.

S Speaker 551:59this is sort of the burn profile. Yeah, the here, this is the operating is just this right here, yeah, that's how we get those averages. And then you can see the collateral. And to reach point it's in and out from a

And here's the contribution margin profile. So 24 to 23 driving up to about a 50% contribution margin in 2028 Okay, so
And here's the contribution margin profile. So 24 to 23 driving up to about a 50% contribution margin in 2028 Okay, so
And here's the contribution margin profile. So 24 to 23 driving up to about a 50% contribution margin in 2028 Okay, so
S Speaker 452:39this year will be 41 rough, yeah, that is the plan, yeah. So then your cash balance by the end of this year will be roughly what,
this year will be 41 rough, yeah, that is the plan, yeah. So then your cash balance by the end of this year will be roughly what,
this year will be 41 rough, yeah, that is the plan, yeah. So then your cash balance by the end of this year will be roughly what,
this year will be 41 rough, yeah, that is the plan, yeah. So then your cash balance by the end of this year will be roughly what,
52:54so assuming the 20 by the end December,
so assuming the 20 by the end December,
so assuming the 20 by the end December,
so assuming the 20 by the end December,
S Speaker 452:585 million bucks. Okay, so your cash out is April 26
5 million bucks. Okay, so your cash out is April 26
5 million bucks. Okay, so your cash out is April 26
5 million bucks. Okay, so your cash out is April 26
S Speaker 153:07All right, now that we're there's a few more tweaks we got to make to this model. We're assuming the collateralization, some adjustments are going to get made here. So when we with the venture debt adjustment that we need to model in here. We just got some relief on that from WTI, yeah. And then with the with some relief we're getting on the collateral requirements as well, that'll get pushed into probably June, maybe July, you know, into the June, July timeframe. So you think June or
All right, now that we're there's a few more tweaks we got to make to this model. We're assuming the collateralization, some adjustments are going to get made here. So when we with the venture debt adjustment that we need to model in here. We just got some relief on that from WTI, yeah. And then with the with some relief we're getting on the collateral requirements as well, that'll get pushed into probably June, maybe July, you know, into the June, July timeframe.

And then with the with some relief we're getting on the collateral requirements as well, that'll get pushed into probably June, maybe July, you know, into the June, July timeframe. So you think June or
S Speaker 453:39July, whatever case might be, but you have to, I guess you gotta have to find cash at some point in the first quarter next year. Time Frame, right? Like February, March, right,
July, whatever case might be, but you have to, I guess you gotta have to find cash at some point in the first quarter next year. Time Frame, right? Like February, March, right,
