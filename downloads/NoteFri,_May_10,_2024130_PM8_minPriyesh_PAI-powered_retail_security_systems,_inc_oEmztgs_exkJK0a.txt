right. Yeah. Makes sense. Makes sense. One question I had on the one time revenue,
S Speaker 13:42but we can make a chart for that. You can track that through like, let's say they're out to read a one time on all our whatever is on one on my split receipt. So okay, we pay a premium for the badges, putting them on the line and there is no notation to be done any doubt that this isn't that those will be the first

S Speaker 15:09Yeah, for sure. Let's face this we are talking about like four cameras. Yeah. And they're trying shot because you guys have a pretty good ceiling in the second GPU.

S Speaker 15:33Super powerful computer. Yeah. Yeah. Putting the ceiling in the beginning was like nine cameras. But I forgot please. This is one camera looking at the hotdogs that box in the ceiling. Fair enough. Got it was pretty light.

S Speaker 16:04to me from Bella. There is nothing that we can do that. So there is no or indeed generate it from that information. And but they gotta keep looking. The key is if they're not picking up something and let them grab up, right? Yeah, there's nothing that we're gonna like. This is so random. Okay, this system is not seeing the item like properly because the kid is holding an umbrella or raising their jacket. Yeah. And like that I keep reviewing that. There is nothing that the system can learn. It learns okay, just keep is an anomaly. But someone is doing something like that. Is an anomaly. This is the trigger for like, how much pressure from you looking at the night when the handle pick? you up at night on the other hand, okay. was present just just two moments that we captured items, go to the polls and put one back garden Jesus there is one ID that we have to do this system, give them up there, okay, just to weed two items. And then okay to say yeah, these are the two items so the system gets like on point more, and the confidence level starts during the day we got like around 87% of everything right the first time it was in the press was like, Oh, that cover right? Yeah, I was already the seventh. So probably like one more year. system would be it would make
