S Speaker 111:23We've been very, very comprehensive over you. Thanks a lot for that. So that really paints the entire picture for me, if I were to summarize, and I come from a non technical background, so some of this may be naive to me, naive questions from my end. But excuse me for that. But if I were to summarize, I understand that there's a lot of manual processes that go into documentation, and you would rather have engineering team do the core engineering work rather than the operation work that goes around it. There's also a lot of information lag when teams move around. And what was unique to me was to understand that there is also very cross functional dependency on documentation in this entire space. What seems to me is that essentially, you, in the end, the grand vision would be to create a root called Root Cause Analysis System, or maybe even even a proactive root cause analysis system to inform teams of different changes, and the way you want to enter that market is a wedge with documentation. Now Do do you see documentation, or scope Docs as a new platform sort of going in, tying up all of the data input sources you mentioned, and then sitting on top of a lot of other systems. Or do you see some of these systems sort of evolving themselves into documentation? For example, you mentioned cursor, right? If, if, in the future, you see a lot of engineering team adopt that. Do you see cursor sort of also adding a documentation piece? Because you, because I have come across a lot of companies from the YC batches, trying to work on code documentation, right? Just that as a problem, not really taking a lot of different data inputs and creating a more comprehensive documentation on it, but just for code writing code updates. So do you see some of these apps expanding? Do you see a new layer forming over here?

S Speaker 117:00and Vivian in it's an interesting vision for the product roadmap in the future. Do you see the UI looking like an agent working in the backend and propagating sort of tickets across different platforms that different teams use? Because there's a part of the platform you want to which bit which will be cross function and part, which would be, say, between different engineering teams within a function, but between different teams. So how do you see the UI sort of evolving? Yeah, well, that's a great question. I'm figuring it out today. The

S Speaker 118:17sure, absolutely, as you go through the process. And great to have a design partner in this entire thing. As you go through the process, I'm sure things will evolve. Where are you in the entire journey? Vivian, happy to sort of also explore like I guess, happy to explore if there is anything that, if you can look up through my connections and any of our portfolio companies, if you see there's anything of value that I can connect to you. Happy to do those. But in general, where are you in the entire process? What part of the pieces have you built? And where do you see, like the next milestones coming up?
sure, absolutely, as you go through the process. And great to have a design partner in this entire thing. As you go through the process, I'm sure things will evolve.

S Speaker 218:56Yeah. So I know we're running out about time. I can go a little already in need. But where I'm at is I have my design partners. I have another design partner conversation. So I have an SMB design partner, and then I have a large fortune, 500 fortune, 600 company that I'm like keeping warm and discussion with. And then I have another enterprise where they verbally agreed, but then they're like a 4000 person company, and they're VP of Engineering, and it's like kind of a discussion back and forth. I'm trying to find my co founder for it. In addition to that, like I've I'm wrapping up soon my accelerator with foundation capital, and then I'm going into antler in September, yeah, well, and then I have commitments, or like, verbal commitments from previous people that I've worked with that are willing to fund to some degree. So I might be going out for like, pre seed funding, but it might be just angels. And like people I've worked with in the past, based on the conversation I had with them, they basically said they believed in the product, but they more so believe in me as a person and for me to execute it, and so they're willing to basically give me a good chunk of money for it. And I was actually, like, still taking my jaw off of the ground,
Yeah. So I know we're running out about time. I can go a little already in need. But where I'm at is I have my design partners. I have another design partner conversation.

S Speaker 220:30honest, this is my first company I've ever built, but I've been an entrepreneur within a company, and then I was at two pretty successful companies that were able to IPO eventually. So I know that timing matters, even with IPOs as well. And so right now, I'm, like, trying to push really hard with selling. And I just told someone today that, like, I'm deciding whether or not I go out for funding. Because right now, because I'm a one person team, it's a it's getting

S Speaker 121:01hard. I can imagine. But I love your energy, Vivint, it's a very strong vision that you have, and some good problems to have in the space, like I mentioned, happy to connect you, or sort of explore collaborations when you think the time is right. I guess you are a little bit early in the process for me to make any internal connections at Qualcomm right now, but when the time is right, feel free to reach out happy to make those connections as well. And in case you do go out for funding, and if you want some more institutional if you decide to take more institutional capital, happy to connect you to some pre seed, good pre seed investors that I know of. I absolutely love the vision for sure. Would love to see as things evolve and keep you posted.

S Speaker 121:52very soon, absolutely would appreciate that. Would love to keep a track on how things are evolving. Awesome. Thank you. It was a pleasure chatting with you. Thank you, everyone. Great. Great meeting you and hope we will stay in touch. Yeah, have a great one. You, too. Bye. You. Bye.
