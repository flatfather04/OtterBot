S Speaker 10:00Good, very good, very good. Long time since we last chatted, yeah, two weeks, yeah, I know I we, we caught up earlier, I think in September last year, when you guys were just starting up, and we had met in at the step conference. But at that time, yeah, but at that time, like for Qualcomm ventures, it was very early. I heard from some of our friends at HFO that the company has really rebranded you have done when you've created an open audio sort of front for the fish audio thing. And I was seeing a lot of interest on Reddit and YouTube channels as well about facial audio, so Todd would love to sort of catch up and see where you guys are, how you're thinking about the product from now. Yeah,

Yeah,
S Speaker 20:49so for us, we are most working on the instruction or the control part recently. So obviously we want the audio to be more controllable and more expressive. Maybe, I'm sure your demo yet. So this is the our latest model, which we show.

S Speaker 21:16Yeah. So here's a research demo. It's not pretty stable yet this week, but you can see you can use text to control the emotion of this kind of audio

S Speaker 12:49is pretty interesting. Love it. The model is really working well. And I've seen some other models trying to sort of do better at control. And I think it's not just audio. A lot of video models are trying to do as well, but just to have the text prompt in there as terrified voice or excited voice, and the model sort of gets that. That's pretty interesting. What's the architecture behind it? Srira, how are you doing it? The architecture is the same when we made

S Speaker 23:16last time I see two autoregress models started stacked together, but we have worked a lot on the data side, so we rewrite the entire data pipeline alongside both the word security detection speed to test speed separation. We have built lots of different models so we can have a model that annotate and random audio in the internet. Internet to start exact, so we can use it to trend,

S Speaker 13:47very interesting. And how's the company doing right now? Like I remember we were discussing, you mentioned you would go with a freemium model. I think you still have a freemium model. How is that doing? And how are you getting a lot of customers

S Speaker 24:01today? So basically, we cut down the premium model a little bit. Now they all can only generate 20 audios when using a free outcome in one month. And now obviously more people are paying for the premium users, which is $15 per month or one $20 per year. And yeah, we have grown from 400k to 4

S Speaker 14:25million revenue. Well, that's That's amazing. That's amazing. And so you say a subscription based model. And do you have any credit usage there, like any usage based pricing? Or is it unlimited after you take a subscription? Yeah, so we
million revenue. Well, that's That's amazing. That's amazing. And so you say a subscription based model. And do you have any credit usage there, like any usage based pricing? Or is it unlimited after you take a subscription? Yeah, so we

S Speaker 24:40have a subscription. It's unlimited for personal use right now. And in our next model, which will be the evolution current model you see here is a much larger model. It will be credit based, and our API is also credit based.

S Speaker 14:54Got it, and that's that's this revenue growth is amazing, man, how? How are you sort of comparing with other players in the market today? There is cartesia, 11 Labs has been like around for years, and then new companies, like smallest AI, are also coming up. So how do you compare? And do you see fish audio, sort of filling up some different application in the market? Or do you directly, heads on compete with some of these players. So

S Speaker 25:25I would say they are more on B to B right now, while we are more focused on prosumer, because we think, when we have personal customers, we can integrate the model much faster, since we can get a feedback and do AB testing.

S Speaker 25:45I would say our tag is like a voice. Cloning is already much better than 11 s and most competitors, and we can give it a try. And our next release, which will be the instruction model, will be just ahead of the gap.

S Speaker 16:03Yeah, that makes sense. So you say more prosumer focus. So what are the use cases that people are using it for today? The last time we were chatting, you mentioned there were a lot of companion use cases. Has that shifted? So prosumer doesn't use that for companion task
Yeah, that makes sense. So you say more prosumer focus. So what are the use cases that people are using it for today? The last time we were chatting, you mentioned there were a lot of companion use cases. Has that shifted? So prosumer doesn't use that for companion task

S Speaker 16:36interesting, and these content creators, so the sense I got from, let's say, going through some of the Reddit post and some YouTube videos were that voice cloning is something that is really hitting it in the market today. And you also mentioned that your voice cloning is much better than the other players in the market. Do you have you done any benchmark studies? Is it very clear today that the voice cloning is much better than what an 11 laps would provide.

S Speaker 27:07Yeah, and we did some benchmark internally. We wrote some most tests according multiple like double blind, most test according multiple hours clone and yeah, we are the

S Speaker 17:19best. Got it. Got it. That's, that's great, man. So what's, what's the plan going forward? I think you, you scored amazing revenue. The product is working. Well. Do you plan to be fundraising? And, like, I think last time we were talking, you mentioned you were trying to raise a seed round. Did you do that? Or you're trying to raise any Yeah. And how big was that round? It's a two month. Got it. And do you plan to be raising anytime soon? Yeah,
best. Got it. Got it. That's, that's great, man. So what's, what's the plan going forward? I think you, you scored amazing revenue. The product is working. Well. Do you plan to be fundraising?

7:48we are raising our day now.
we are raising our day now.
we are raising our day now.
we are raising our day now.
S Speaker 17:52Yeah. And how big do you think, like, have you already started raising that? Do you plan to be doing that soon? We started one two days ago. Oh, wow, perfect timing. Then. So she I think I can give you a brief about Qualcomm ventures, and I think we discussed this, but would give you a refresher around that. So what Qualcomm ventures? We are the corporate venture arm of Qualcomm. Our check sizes are two to $15 million and we typically come in at series A or Series B, that's our preferred sweet spot. A lot of times our I would say sweet spot around check sizes would be five to seven. But we for AI investments, we have done smaller checks around two as well. And then for a lot of our companies, we are trying to see if we can natively enable some of these models or applications, especially in AI on some of our AI PCs or AI mobile mobiles. So we feel if we can make a few of these partnerships happen, that would enable very fast scale and go to market for our partner companies. And we have already been doing this with a few companies in your space, you would realize there's a company called Music AI, which does stem separation, and that's a Qualcomm partner, so we have natively enabled them in a lot of AI PCs that go around. So that's a value proposition we bring. It's an exciting space. Man, I'd love to sort of dig a little bit deeper. How big a round Are you raising this time, five to 10? Yeah. And will it be a price round?
Yeah. And how big do you think, like, have you already started raising that? Do you plan to be doing that soon? We started one two days ago. Oh, wow, perfect timing. Then.

And do you have like, a target valuation in mind?
And do you have like, a target valuation in mind?
And do you have like, a target valuation in mind?
S Speaker 19:40Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. And here, do you have a deck or data room put together? But we don't have a dad for this one? Yeah, that's fair. That's fair. Let me go through the deck and let me come back with a few follow up questions with you. And then how does your availability look like for next week, I would like to schedule a call with our managing director as well. He's out,
