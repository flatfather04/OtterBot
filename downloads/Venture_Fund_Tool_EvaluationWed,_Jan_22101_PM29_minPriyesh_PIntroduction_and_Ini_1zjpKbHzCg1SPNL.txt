3:28please tell me, is
S Speaker 33:30it like I checked your crunch based profile so as well? So you mostly invest series A plus so lower checks now.
it like I checked your crunch based profile so as well? So you mostly invest series A plus so lower checks now.

it like I checked your crunch based profile so as well? So you mostly invest series A plus so lower checks now.
S Speaker 13:39So we have started doing some lower checks, especially in AI. So we would opportunistically do seed but mostly Series A, plus still.

S Speaker 33:50Okay, the check size for seeds and check size for round size for seeds and round size for Series A. So what are they starting?

all crazy. What's going
S Speaker 14:07on. So just like, I know totally I think we wouldn't go anything below a $1.5 million check for a seed round, and then our sweet spot is somewhere between five to $7 million so that's what we typically plan to do for a series. A or later. We have done larger checks as well, but those are all again, opportunistic, or sometimes we have done 1015 as well, but sweet spot would be five to seven, and the lowest would be 1.5 the
on.

S Speaker 14:50for you semiconductors. Sometime, we, being a semiconductor company, we have to sort of think about it quite deeply. I'd say AI infrastructure, AI applications are right up the gamut. Semiconductors would be a far stretch, but we would still look at that okay, just like

5:18defense and other
S Speaker 15:19things too. Yes, defense might be slightly sensitive, so we'll have to see, and we'll have to pass it through our compliance team. But other than defense, we would look at AI applications in any, any of the specific verticals, B to B, mostly B to C as well. I mean, we have done a few consumer investments in B to C. We did humane so we have done a few investments there, but the focus would be more on B to B, yeah,
things too. Yes, defense might be slightly sensitive, so we'll have to see, and we'll have to pass it through our compliance team.

S Speaker 112:58happening Today. This is very interesting. Pavel, so you mentioned you onboard users or startups directly. What's their incentive to sort of give you regular updates on their traction financing things like that. How do you get those data points between financing rounds? Because

S Speaker 115:19Very interesting. So I understand that. I think it's kind of a cash 22 situation right now, because as an investor, I'd like to onboard myself immediately. Because of all the features that you do. I sort of do that myself across different fragmented ways. Have my own workflows to do so all of that. And would love to have everything consolidated in one position. But at the same time, you also see that you have a small number of startups onboarded today. So how do I, as as let's say, a user, assess it at the moment for my feasibility?
Very interesting. So I understand that. I think it's kind of a cash 22 situation right now, because as an investor, I'd like to onboard myself immediately. Because of all the features that you do.

S Speaker 315:54So what I would propose you here, at least create a profile. It's free of charge now, yeah, just like jumping create your profile, tell us what you need, which companies you need. So once we match, once we have the ones that fits your criteria, you will be notified, and they can be like, first step of your way to get the deal sourcing from us right now, number one, simple thing, the other thing that you can already test it out, you can just upload some decks that, again, you don't just, like, don't have time, or maybe you didn't have like, enough patience to work with them. You just upload here. We will go through that. We will note again, we will send you that you can try these two features right away. Like, free of charge, I will give you like number of credits for internal startups analysis as well. So you play with that, and then, just like, once we feel that okay, company grew up enough to have enough data for us to to be a consistent customer, then we can discuss already about some level of deep integrations with your existing CRMs, with the holiest tech teams to be joined step by step. Yeah, we're on this stage. We understand that, but we are glad anyways, to provide value today, even with that thing that we do today.

S Speaker 116:59Oh, that's that's actually quite a valuable solution. I'll make I'll make sure that I do create an account right after this. Pavel today, how open is the platform? Can I go in and see what level of data for each of the companies? Is there a blocker or a filter somewhere in between? I'm sure a lot of these startups wouldn't want to make all of their data public to all the investors. So is there a matching filtering layer in between, something like that?

S Speaker 317:25So, yeah. So we have matching layer between. So we match based on different sets of criteria they provide for what we provide publicly now, for that, for that stage, now it's the investment
So, yeah. So we have matching layer between. So we match based on different sets of criteria they provide for what we provide publicly now, for that, for that stage, now it's the investment
So, yeah. So we have matching layer between. So we match based on different sets of criteria they provide for what we provide publicly now, for that, for that stage, now it's the investment

S Speaker 122:07exactly, exactly. I totally agree. That is how it should work. Everything. All of these smaller workflows are fragmented and just makes a lot of sense to bring everything together that would make a lot of our jobs easier. Again, a curious point here on the product roadmap. Pavel, do you down the line see uh, or are you thinking about it that you could possibly give an investor some benchmarking data? So for example, I am investing in a Series A AI agent company, which is vertical first, can I get to know how other companies in this particular space are growing their traction? Sort of benchmarking data around them.

S Speaker 322:51Once we will grow that data lake, for sure, reports, insights and benchmarks, everything will be there. It's a question of the volumes of data to collapse. Yeah. The goal for this year is 20, 25,000 companies with actual data, plus great a lot about competition and marketing size. And with that, we will be, it will be enough for us already to make quite serious insights on the things and provide the benchmarks there. Yes, that's how you said, yes. Very,

S Speaker 123:16very amazing. You also mentioned you're planning to raise a round. How are you thinking about it? How big around do you envision for now?
very amazing. You also mentioned you're planning to raise a round. How are you thinking about it? How big around do you envision for now?

S Speaker 323:24So the Yeah, we are going to raise now seed because it's bootstrapped company. So I go into receipt now I can see the photo million. Now it will be enough for us to make the wood mile with what's what I just told you about. And with that, we will potentially jump on the potentially late CDO or series A depends on the volumes our projections to make the next 12 months,
So the Yeah, we are going to raise now seed because it's bootstrapped company. So I go into receipt now I can see the photo million.

23:49million plus ARR
S Speaker 323:52and yeah, with that, we will be very good so, because the goal is to make it to reach the API stage in summer, and with that, it will Be very different story. Absolutely,
and yeah, with that, we will be very good so, because the goal is to make it to reach the API stage in summer, and with that, it will Be very different story. Absolutely,

24:26Yeah, absolutely
S Speaker 124:58to them? So we do not really have an application form, even our website, it does not have, let's say, a place where people can just send in their deck things like that. A lot of it within the team has been just talking to startups, cold outreach, demo days, events, getting deals from our network, getting deals from some of our founders things like that. So we don't have an onboarding form as such. And I've seen most of our most of the partners I work with, everyone has their own way of evaluating a deal. I would say one of the most critical things for us is that we really prefer having a technologically strong founder. So internally, everyone. When we do an assessment, we try to sort of gage how technically adept a founder is. So maybe for that, we look at a lot of factors that past background. Do they come out? What have they done in the past? Are they a repeat founder? Have they worked at one of the big tech companies? Have they worked in the specific vertical that they are building in, things like that, especially for early stage companies, and then a bunch of other metric driven questions, things like that. But did I answer your question correctly? Or can I can I give you you
