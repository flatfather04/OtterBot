S Speaker 11:38Sherry, so great. Great meeting you at the Lama lounge. Great demo, for sure. I think the context here is that with Qualcomm, we ship a lot of compute chips across different devices. In fact, I was looking at the number. It's with more than a couple billion of chips that we ship every year. And these compute chips go across mobile PCs on prem compute, XR automobiles, IoT. We even have a cloud compute platform. So for some of these platforms, we work with some startups very closely. And in this case, we are evaluating a few, I would say, horizontal AI agent or computer use. AI agent companies specifically to partner with our aipc effort as well, but at the same time, we are an investment firm, so looking for the right investments as well. So wanted to have a chat with you regarding that. We have spoken to a few, I would say, horizontal agent creation platforms like through AI Lang chain, some no code ones as well, and evaluated manual Manus AI as well. Very recently, would love to understand, how are you building? How, what? What the product focus like? How do you plan to differentiate from some of these applications that are there in the market

S Speaker 23:02sounds good, yeah, so we are computer we're building computer use agents, for sure. And we, you know, started this mission, and towards the end of last year, because we really, like saw the great potential of computer use technology, the great news to us is we're still at the early stage, I think, of this technology wave. So there are a lot of exciting opportunities ahead of us. And the unique angle we're taking, which is based on our team's expertise, is we're really focusing on the desktop environment, so which, I think is a broader, you know, superset of the web. Because from the desktop, you can broaden everything the broader agent can do. The reason why we, you know, want to work on the desktop environment is we believe only in that way you can have, you know, the deep integration with users. You know, the desktop environment as as well as the operating system. So there's a lot of optimization you can work out to really improve the user experience with the user. And then at the same time, since we're, you know, working on the desktop environment, we can, ultimately, like, unlock a lot of use cases, which, you know, any like any desktop app, like either, like our Mac on Windows, on Linux, like, as long as it's on the desktop, we should be able to capture that unique use case and deliver value to the end users. In the long term, computer technologies feel like, you know, nascent further, like a lot of solved engineering challenges, but that is like, roughly the long term vision we have, and then the approach and the unique effort we're taking.

S Speaker 14:53Yeah, very interesting. Sherry, so let's say if, for that purpose, very close competitor for you would be a general purpose agent, which is browser use and computer use. For that matter. I think Manus could be a very close competitor for you. Is that? Is that right?
Yeah, very interesting. Sherry, so let's say if, for that purpose, very close competitor for you would be a general purpose agent, which is browser use and computer use. For that matter. I think Manus could be a very close competitor for you. Is that? Is that right?

S Speaker 16:02from a from a desktop use perspective, why do you think browser use is a bigger use case in terms of where the market is pulling you today, versus the entire desktop and owning the entire desktop environment? Why did you choose between not just being a browser use agents versus trying to sort of go entire desktop environment? Yeah, I think

S Speaker 26:43use your day to day, you know, the more workload could happen in the browser. So broader, you guys, like a nice subset, like low hanging fruit, I would say you only need to solve the broader environment, and then you can capture, say, like 70, 80% of the, you know, the value. So that's a, you know, a really nice starting point, and why we're seeing like, for example, open eyes operator, you know, they launched their brother, use the operator, web agent. And then can immediately, like, people start to use it, and like, start to see the value to answer your question, like, why we are choosing a desktop? Because it's definitely not a low hanging fruit. It's probably like, mid hang or high hanging food, yeah, because we don't, we think that desktop is, you know, the like, the space that big players, like opening is, Forbid, are less likely to enter because it involves, like, for example, you know, the integration with users computer. There's also, like, you know, the safety and, you know the privacy concerns, because a lot of, like, the screenshots are, you know, happening on

S Speaker 27:56and what else, yeah, and then it also, like, when we move to the desktop. There's also the possibility of serving, you know, the model influence parts locally on Venus computer. So all these are really, I think, nice, you know, value, like nice angles that can provide a lot of value. But like, you know, large providers like open AI product are very less likely to work out, yeah, that's why, as a startup, we choose to work on the desktop so that we can appreciate

S Speaker 18:27Yeah, that makes sense Sherry And in fact, running inference on device is something that Qualcomm wants to big bet very big, the last generation of chipsets that we launched for our AI devices have an NPU on the on the system itself, and then some of the portfolio companies that we we invested in recently, plus some other startup partnerships as well, we are trying to get to get them to port some of their workloads, either all of their workloads, or a part of their workloads, to run natively on on the device, has all the implications around privacy, security, cost, latency, so tons of benefits certainly aligned on that front. You mentioned Sherry, that the technology broadly browser use, as well as desktop uses, in nascent stages today,

10:00a couple of dollars,
S Speaker 210:02which, from the cost perspective, we haven't been able to really justify. So we need to, you know, either, like, optimize down the cost, or maybe moving more workloads to users computer to users on compute that is basically free. More, you know, holding out the you know, maybe like the hardware, you know, investment, the cost could, you know, drastically decrease. So that's why one and then, in addition to cost, the proof workers on desktop is also another issue. Especially like on desktop, different people have, you know, different configurations, different desktop layouts and different operating systems. You know, a lot of apps that the model probably has never seen before is training data. Yeah. So how, how well can model generalize to, for example, on scene apps or on scene environments? That's something I think the entire community, both the research and the engineering community are pushing towards, but I'm very optimistic. I don't see any, you know, rocket science in, you know, in this area, I think they're just a matter of time. We just need more data, you know, like, better models,

S Speaker 211:21like, business side, or like, you know, the market side. So minus is probably like, one of the first general triggers agents that have, you know, really proved to their cell market. There's a huge need. There's below business value. But they are also not like doing, say, like, full mission based automation, or, you know, like, for more, although they're like saying they're doing, like, they're already doing AGI. I think that still some less distance between what they're doing versus AGI. But

like, business side, or like, you know, the market side. So minus is probably like, one of the first general triggers agents that have, you know, really proved to their cell market. There's a huge need. There's below business value.

So I think minus will be the first one, and then they are educating the market, and then there will be more agents like minus, you know, gradually coming to a market on the road. When will I reach that turning point? Is that I think the engineers are very accustomed to, like, say, having an agent on their computer with other workloads for the agents. I think there's also, like, a user behavior change. But as I said, I think a lot of startups also, like companies, are educating the user behavior shift.

Sherry, you mentioned a couple of other companies across although I haven't come across them in terms of computer use, but interesting to see that there are more companies are doing the same thing. How do you see your technical architecture, your product, being differentiated from some of these competitors? I haven't taken a look at them, but your view, would love to understand a little bit. Yeah,
like, got it. Got it. Sherry, very interesting.

Yeah,
S Speaker 214:16that's a perfect question. So after the commercial competitors come downstairs, were actually the first, you know, the first will release our demo video back in January, and then, like for example, there are a few other companies also releasing their demos are very similar to the initial innovation we have in our video, even though they're probably more published than
that's a perfect question.

14:36the demo we did In January, I

the demo we did In January, I
the demo we did In January, I
S Speaker 214:41think so. One of the key differences is, I think, although our team is also focused, because I myself largely leading with, like, a product driven mindset, we understand there. You know, there's a time window between the training point for technology to fly off what we're trying to achieve before that turning point is given the current technology, can we, like, for example, putting more like engineering hacks and optimization to make it already usable current users today, like this is working out some workflow and no AI research questions and Really try, me trying to solve this hard research problem. Problems. Yeah. So the other two competitors, I told you, I think one that came out of sales two days ago, they were incubated about Seattle. That's what we're CEOs. And then we go, like, House of research scientists working on this card. I think there are much more research so, yeah. So yeah, so our approach is, you know, we have the technical, you know, definitely, obviously the problem, we know, maybe six months, maybe a year. And then what we're trying to do is, you know, really focus on the user problem and see what we can do is encourage the state, the state of the technology, and what kind of product we can already deliver to our users to

S Speaker 217:16approach? Here we're we're taking a lot of approach, but the corner store piece of technology is computer use. Like, for example, the brother uses open source project, you know, they they're using a hybrid approach, which is, you know, taking account of both the doc of the web page as well as, like, you know, the screenshot of the web page from the units perspective, perspective. So in that way, they can lower the cost and provide while providing a relatively good results. But our computer, you know, turning off different operating systems, the information you can get safer belonging, like on math or something called application true or something if it does information from the operating system, but not much, because you're largely driven by what you can see on the

I understand you're not raising right now, and that that will come sometime soon, but I would love to stay connected till then. As a follow up, I would, I would like to set up another meeting and include the managing director of quantum ventures as well Tushar. I work very closely with Tushar. We take care of our AI investment strategy, and Tushar has been pioneering a lot of our startup partnerships with our aipcc. I believe if we can shift some of your workloads on the PC itself, that would be a huge unlock. Hope. In terms of the training data, you can get the cost across things like that, even adoption, we can potentially try to have you natively adopted across a lot of PCs, which will be shipping from year going forward. So that would be a great proposition, I feel. Let me come back to you with some more of my questions. I have, in fact, actually not tried the product myself. I should have, and I have your visiting card here with 3000 but I could not go back and try the product myself, so I will. I will do that lovely around to some extent, come back.
