============================================================

S Speaker 10:00three primary users are developers and actually is a very recently we're pulling in technical product managers, because usually the technical design document is like a communication channel between the product goal goals and like how it's gonna get developed and the product managers are often a part of that conversation. They're the ones that are looking at the technical designs and then there is the another cohort of users that we think will be a good fit. We haven't started really like getting into these conversations. Yet, but it's the technical writers. So some of the companies that we we talked to, they said like okay, we have our PR tenco PMS or developers working together, and then, as the feature nears completion, we also have technical writers come in and create a bunch of documentation whether it be public facing or internal. So I think like that is would be another class of users that we're hoping to serve. So

S Speaker 11:17This is also what we've been interested in. We came at this from the direction using coding assistance. The coding systems are very single player and like building software's like there's huge themes involved. So we're trying to think like, how do we make it like Koya into assisting a whole like organization as opposed to just like one person?

S Speaker 21:39Absolutely. I saw that you're building some collaboration tools around the entire product. How does that go? I would be very curious to know more than about that.

S Speaker 11:50So yeah, the collaboration features are they're not particularly unique. Basically, the the way we're approaching this is we want to be at parity with Google. Docs. Okay, so so like collaborative editing, like multiple cursors, like common sections, and then we want to make sure that you can ingest the code base into that and then you can actually use assets into that. So the collaboration is mostly around those features we that we shipped a couple weeks ago. Yeah. And then the next thing to step up from there will be whole workspace. So similar to like the way notion would work where you have all like, you know, directories that correspond to different components in your system. Interesting.

S Speaker 22:38So correct me if I'm wrong Maxim here. I can imagine the solution being used before someone goes and develops a software during the technical designing part of it. But do you also get involved during the entire development process?

S Speaker 12:56So that is, that's a great question. And it's the one we're thinking about a lot. We don't necessarily get involved in things like observability. But what we do want to involve in and this is a problem that we've heard over and over again, yeah. People say that they create a cycle design and then they like their dev team goes and implement something. And inevitably, something always changes, like some details just like, you know, come up during the implementation. And people say, Well, nobody goes back and updates the design doc. So like, those two things get out of sync before the feature is even built. Right right. So I like part of the reason why these documents don't get updated because like it's it sucks. It's not. It's not a fun. It's like doing homework. Yeah, absolutely. So I think this is where we can deliver like ongoing value through the lifecycle of the of the project. Absolutely. I
So that is, that's a great question. And it's the one we're thinking about a lot. We don't necessarily get involved in things like observability.

S Speaker 14:21So let me think about the best way to approach this what we would like is to actually just put this up because Rob was just refining this, this profile. What we'd like to do is talk to some people, whether they are Qualcomm or like a network of your portfolio companies. And these would be the people that are like tech leads these events, like you know, technical heads of products, that kind of profile and just understand what their experience has been with this part. Of the workflow. I think, like we're still running like a mix of discovery and sales. So those those conversations don't necessarily be like, Oh, we're pitching them on the sale like Yeah, I think would be most interested in like really understanding what it's like to do this. At like a really large enterprise because like, my previous experience has been like I worked at Bridgewater on taking algorithms Yeah, which is not quite like the same as Qualcomm. There's some overlap, and then Rob was like Tesla and SpaceX, so they're still relatively young. Companies. And we want to learn about like these older beasts. That's

S Speaker 25:45a very interesting background. I'm curious. How did you guys get to go to do this crazy thing?
a very interesting background. I'm curious. How did you guys get to go to do this crazy thing?
a very interesting background. I'm curious. How did you guys get to go to do this crazy thing?
a very interesting background. I'm curious. How did you guys get to go to do this crazy thing?
5:51Yeah, so we did go to college together. Yeah. So I know I've known him from from Berkeley.
Yeah, so we did go to college together. Yeah. So I know I've known him from from Berkeley.

S Speaker 27:18Totally. That makes sense. Matson Can you tell me a little bit more about your tech stack using GPD for our how have you built an entire tech stack?

7:29are using are using a lot of things in terms of a lab, so I think like we're using when we're switching back and forth, as the models have been leapfrogging each other like yesterday. Sonic 3.5 came out seems great. So now I'm like, Alright, let's see.

S Speaker 17:50Let's see how that goes. We have been using a lot of GPT for like our primary like user facing a little behind the scenes. We're using a couple of different ones. A lot of a drop of models. Three, do you think you're going five? Gemini for some of the larger contexts, tasks, natural to basically like, the reason why we're using so many alarms is we're working on a feature set in the background that creates like synthetic documentation for big codebase because like a lot of the bigger customers they're like they have much ago they don't even know what it does. Yeah. So we're building or like we're bringing that in. In terms of the rest of the tech stack, it's I can't say this is any like British shattering stuff. We're like using like natural gas and like we have like a bunch of infrastructure that runs

S Speaker 18:53readers. That kind of thing. We are like, within like on the precipice of grand fine tune or on models, but like we keep pushing it off, because it can take a lot of time and effort and like we're trying to like do more like user facing work at this point. Yeah. But this is something that is like we're gonna have to start doing probably sooner rather later. Both for like cost reasons, but also because we want to basically what we do, we try to get the LM seduce planning, but then we have like some human feedback with that. It's that we want to build models that are like really good at multi step planning, use it leveraging the human feedback, that just coming through. So I'll pause here. That's basically what we're doing.

S Speaker 111:03Yeah, that sounds great. Actually, Rob just updated our sales tech. So I will be sending that over to you. This actually reminds me of one question. I don't understand quite well like what's the mixture of like software versus hardware that happens? In Qualcomm. To put this context, to put this question into context, yeah, we just talked to someone from Nvidia who's been a video for many years and he pointed out a very interesting thing for us. He's like, look, okay, and Vidya is like a hardware company at its heart. And then you know, like, 10 years ago, they decided they were going to develop software and like the difference in the process there were like, their hardware side has excellent design specification, because it's hardware. Yeah, their software is like, and, and it's different because like, you know, it's like companies like Microsoft, their software. First they have this process for software. So I'm curious, like, what like, is there like how much software does Qualcomm develop and like, what what is like the split between the company there?
Yeah, that sounds great. Actually, Rob just updated our sales tech. So I will be sending that over to you. This actually reminds me of one question.
