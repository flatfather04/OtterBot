S Speaker 10:00A very richly priced round of the parties. So those kind of, like, you know, very large rounds from both sides and on the steel side. Like, you know, we made some small investments in very early companies when they had applications

S Speaker 20:23Pretty interesting. Bro, like Surprisingly even for us, the initial first half of the year was very slow, and then things started picking up in the last quarter. And like you mentioned, some late stage companies, cartesia, perplexities. But still, we did one investment in NATO time, which competes with samsara on vehicle telematics, smart AI based dash cam for fleet. Interesting. Then one in Cresta, which was which is in call center, I would say, not in complete agent. They plan to develop agents for call center, but right now assisting call center, yeah, yes.

S Speaker 21:1575 million in ARR, something like that. Oh, wow. Hopefully, hopefully. Well, I don't know why we do such late stage deals. It's probably at two and a half x 3x from here, but still, it's Cresta in this market. Yeah, yeah.
75 million in ARR, something like that. Oh, wow. Hopefully, hopefully. Well, I don't know why we do such late stage deals. It's probably at two and a half x 3x from here, but still, it's Cresta in this market. Yeah, yeah.

S Speaker 21:41I spoke to this, this company called retail, and I've heard retail and bland AI, they have amazing and I'm sure woke on the company, they are forgetting its name, very prominently known, Seco ya backed. But these companies are doing amazingly well in terms of AI sales agents, they we tried retail like on the call, he gave us a demo, and was amazingly well surprise. Okay, so I don't think rest has a chance on winning an AI native space. We didn't even model for it, so you just basically parked the current business Yeah,

2:25but how big was around? Like, what was the valuation?

S Speaker 22:33bro, that guy, you remember, we were talking about the ID bomb, big guy. I spoke to him one week. He closed around, wow, sure, like initially, if then it was more of a personal connection. So he told me he's looking at Menlo and foundation capital and be more recently, when we I introduced my partner and we were discussing in terms of an investment, then he wasn't very upfront about it. So I still think it's Menlo. Probably one more multi stage fund came in, and we didn't get allocation like always.

S Speaker 23:20But never got back someone like this guy does just a post that I have left meta, and now I'm building something new.

3:34Everyone excited,
S Speaker 23:39as a as a well, how are you thinking about the early stage investments that you're doing in applications like, what's the thought process there? Yeah, yeah.
as a as a well, how are you thinking about the early stage investments that you're doing in applications like, what's the thought process there? Yeah, yeah.
as a as a well, how are you thinking about the early stage investments that you're doing in applications like, what's the thought process there? Yeah, yeah.
as a as a well, how are you thinking about the early stage investments that you're doing in applications like, what's the thought process there? Yeah, yeah.
S Speaker 13:50It's very difficult. Because, like, you know, our default is to basically benchmark all the companies and then, like, you know, find out those that we think is the best one. So India, whenever we invest, we invest like, you know, with this Coronavirus, but obviously in us, in AI, it's impossible to map the entire company landscape, right? So what we are doing is like, you know, we are looking at some unique ideas and some unique approaches. Have, like, you know, gotten the new insight, and then on the back of that insight, like, you know, he is building something. So I think that has been the DNA of companies that we have backed so far. Now, again, like, you know, the challenges the application markets can get covered. If it's a good category, if, like, you know, few players are seeing traction, more will come challenges. But we thought, like, you know, it's maybe better to, like, do some of these investments and see how it goes. Then, like, just sit on the sideline or not do anything. So right now, I think we're doing this only. I needed my personal philosophy. Yeah, my personal philosophy is that, like, you know, like, we have to, like, find out some gaps in the ecosystem right now, but we must say any other gap. So, like you said, every person like you know who leaves Google or meta, they end up, like racing around in a week or so. So I think that is a challenge. Now the task then becomes to engage. Then before we even leave, like when they are thinking of leaving, it's impossible for us to do it, like sitting up way across the world. You can go like small dinners first and call people over. You can do those kind of things. But I think that is something that we are trying to or say I am trying to figure out that how do we find a gap which is there in the ecosystem, and then try to, like, you know, build some proposition for that gap. So, very entrepreneurial mindset, like, yeah, broken hand. The other thing that we saw was, let's say some companies, for example, right? Like, we end up with whatever, two people in five minutes now, like, if they are building, let's say, some big technical stuff. So it will be a two year build cycle. You do a two year build cycle. Then basically you start getting some early customers. So you are not ready, ready for CE, but you have, like, you know, at least the product a little bit, yeah, then mama pay there may be, like, you know, an appointment go around so it won't be seen. It will be something like, like, you know, P series, a kind of a thing. The company raised the 7 million seed, but wants to raise a 25 million. They might do another like, you know, 10 5 million. So the best companies won't need that. But some, like, you know, decent companies, longer to build, may need that, yeah, so can we then, like, you know, at that at this point? So that's the second thing that, like, you know, we are feeling. But I think the ideas, I think the other option, is just to, like, you know, compete with everybody, be early through conviction, maybe try to
It's very difficult. Because, like, you know, our default is to basically benchmark all the companies and then, like, you know, find out those that we think is the best one.

S Speaker 27:21so though the early stage, let's say application investments you're doing is there, let's say a thesis behind one industry, one function specific, which bets layer rather than spraying and praying in a specific area, yeah,

S Speaker 17:45like one learning I had was like, you know, the winners will be anointed by these large VCs, so Harvey can taste like hard tech and all like, you know, is not very like, or, let's just not miles ahead from the competition. But I think we have so much brand capability, and every lock on will buy them. Yeah, so in horizontal labs and very large categories, I think same, or I have a 11 expos are everybody is kind of betting them. Same can happen for coding agents, net, net, horizontal agents, we are slightly like, you know, not sure how to play exceeding series, unless you're super early you see something coming, and you have that more difficult. But for some vertical applications, I think we are thinking, let's say, for example, like, you know, AI for financial distributions, or like, similar, like, you know, certain articles, yeah, you take some respects. So I think our player pay, that's the primary thinking,
like one learning I had was like, you know, the winners will be anointed by these large VCs, so Harvey can taste like hard tech and all like, you know, is not very like, or, let's just not miles ahead from the competition.

8:51yeah, interesting,
S Speaker 28:53by the way, crester was 750 post, 100 million round, okay, so 10x revenue, yeah, yeah. And I think the story they're pitching is that AI native call center agent, sorry, what's the exact
by the way, crester was 750 post, 100 million round, okay, so 10x revenue, yeah, yeah. And I think the story they're pitching is that AI native call center agent, sorry, what's the exact

pitch key? They will do QA for AI agents,
pitch key? They will do QA for AI agents,
pitch key? They will do QA for AI agents,
S Speaker 29:15name, they will not do QA for a dead brain like building brand new AI agents, which will apart, which will learn from all the QA data that they have, serving all of these customer service agents over the while, but it will be a AI native agent taking all the service support call service calls, and then you only need your call center or BP or customer service agents For some of some high escalations kind of

S Speaker 19:49Make sense. Makes sense Nice. Let's see what they do. What happened to that perceptron company,
Make sense. Makes sense Nice. Let's see what they do. What happened to that perceptron company,

Make sense. Makes sense Nice. Let's see what they do. What happened to that perceptron company,
S Speaker 29:58perceptron bro, they put out a release, Desir and the other guys, in fact, you know, during the entire diligence, because we wanted our like we want, we desperately wanted some allocation. So coffee design partner, something introduced out of the 10 design partner they're working with right now. Four were introduced by us. We didn't get allocation, but they've started work building on that. I think the last time we were chatting and told you, I'll show you some of the memos. Let me see if I can find something one second as a separate let me remember they were raising 15 at 85 posts, some something, Something around that, 125 fair founders, with our dilution, separately,

Let me see if I can find something one second as a separate let me remember they were raising 15 at 85 posts, some something, Something around that, 125 fair founders, with our dilution, separately,
perceptron bro, they put out a release, Desir and the other guys, in fact, you know, during the entire diligence, because we wanted our like we want, we desperately wanted some allocation.

S Speaker 211:02separately. Man, I'm I've started working like I will start working seriously on it, but I'm taking a look at the AI agent, AI native agents, security engineer space. So I've seen a few interesting companies come up in this space. So is spoken to a few companies. So think there is some value. The entire coding space has been commoditized, coding,

11:42so this, what he is building, is,
so this, what he is building, is,
so this, what he is building, is,
so this, what he is building, is,
S Speaker 211:49right now, a co pilot for support engineers. And his thesis is that support engineers do not have a platform today. Down the line, they don't have a platform, so they rely on Slack. They have to fight for developers time. They rely on internal documentation which is not as good, and developers time. Developers are usually shielded most of the companies, including, in fact, Qualcomm, right now, only uses a rack pipeline, which is not as accurate. I think internally, ferram, I contact with contextual, we came to about 60% accuracy, which is not working as well. So he's trying to build a co pilot there an AI agent which can contextualize your company's product,

S Speaker 112:41like you know, will he teach the agent to go and crawl these applications to get the information, like the type use case where you have to do Enterprise Search to get an answer,

S Speaker 212:50yes, yes. So lean is more horizontal Enterprise Search. It's not just rack down. Then he wants to build actual automations. He says, key, all of the support cases, if you start cohorting them, it would come down to 80% of them would be 1010, broader use cases, and then the remaining would be some, some rule based automation. So he can still build some automation on them, but it's again, this company still is a two page memo. He doesn't have a product, anything else other than that.

S Speaker 113:27Yeah, but it's an interesting theme. I think basically any use case to pull out information from different sources, I think is a is an interesting one. And you write that Lean is more horizontal, and we can see some like, you know, verticalized versions coming up for, let's say, roles that are very nuanced, yeah,

S Speaker 213:53not in this space, like, separately, a lot of I've met a couple of companies in the space of, how do you automate finding and fixing software vulnerabilities? So finding vulnerabilities like apparently, has been like the security the DevOps security space, 2.0 triaging them you need there's a lot of false positive in finding vulnerabilities, then you need an AI agent to contextualize your code base and then triage the right bugs out of them. And then, right now, the 3.0 companies are building proprietary core code fixes for them so it can go into your code base, write a code fix and fix that specific vulnerability

14:50Sharing my screen on perceptron one sec. So
Sharing my screen on perceptron one sec. So
Sharing my screen on perceptron one sec. So
Sharing my screen on perceptron one sec. So
S Speaker 214:58very fundamentally, bro, what we saw was for video AI, right now, there are vision models which are again object recognition in, I would say, image segmentation, object recognition, and then working on frame by frame on videos. Then there are a few vlls which fundamentally operate on similar way. There isn't a very, I would say, foundational model for the space where we could only find perceptron and poly gamma. Now what I mean with that is one second Eva la graphic. This is on the y axis. This is the thesis. This is cognitive intelligence, and this is an on the x axis, is physical intelligence with physical intelligence. What it means is identifying, let me see, I don't have that slide here, identifying objects, identifying what like percepting objects around it and then percepting their relations between each other. So if, if you step on a grass, that grass will compress, kind of thing, if you move a table left, the object that is on top of it would fall, because the moment and on it is higher and there's no friction, things like that. So having that understanding, and then l3 to l5 here is more on, I would say, the multi modal aspect of it. So this is the sound that would be produced once you hit a table with a metal object, something like that. And then once you once you have built that internal understanding between multimodal data, because all of the other GPT, 4o is multimodal, and it's the own. This the first model which is natively multimodal, which means, when they were training data sets they have, they've made sure that those relationships between different image, video, sound, speech, were put in the model inter at the time of training, and not after training, when train career model goes separately, and then you are building those relationships between different data points. But they want to start with that. And they say the first model, which will be in 2025 will have similar level of physical intelligence as GPT four, oh, but not as much in cognitive intelligence. And what I mean by that is how that is different is one second so

And their path, for perceptron, they would go through this entire path. And so down the line, even with perceptron version 120, 25 they will be able to power a lot of computer vision companies. So there is revenue immediately after next year.

S Speaker 220:39seems like it seems like it like from the outset, is what I can say. Yeah, so, like some of the thesis were, in general, there is a company doing computer vision for wildfire detection, and there it's a very difficult problem to solve. Apparently, it's not a traditional model. Cannot solve it because smoke different conditions with a different weather predict. It's difficult. And if you train a model for wildfire detection, that same model cannot go back and, say, detect fire in a dumpster truck, or, like one use case for spot AI was, can you detect fire in our inventory management for a Walmart? And that same model cannot do it, but perceptron, because it is foundational model, in this sense, it understand what it means when there will be a fire, there will be a smoke. And hence, this is how the entire thing around that involvement would change. It would it would be bright in some areas, it would go darker in some areas and things like that. And hence you won't need to retrain a model on multiple numbers of data sets. Jesus. Makes a lot of sense. Yeah, it's eventually a bet whether they would be able to build it or not. But the thing was, at least, like, if they launch one model, having a very big up round for the immediate next round was a given, so we were betting on that. Yeah,
