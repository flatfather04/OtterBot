Good, good. I mean, we've been so deep in honestly, like, more of, like, the ML research stuff. Over the past couple of months, we realized, like, there was just so much alpha in the topic modeling stuff. So we've actually been, I'm actually meeting a few guys that work in trading here in Chicago. So, like, I don't feel familiar, you know, like Citadel securities trading, all the quants basically do very similar processes for trading algorithms, which is like, so different. So meeting with these guys and just seeing, like, where we can really improve this, and hopefully, like, we can get them to join the team, like, that's actually my end goal. You know in theory, they're like some of the best guys you know in the world, from like a mathematics perspective. So really leading into, like that topic, modeling stuff, and kind of see the product evolving to being sort of like Bloomberg, but for like, culture and social and it's like we're taking a really unique approach. So very exciting. That's

that's very interesting, Kyle, and I agree, there's so much alpha in the space, if you can just structure and present the entire social information, which is so unstructured everywhere, exactly,

Speaker 2
dude, it's crazy. Like, I mean, we're talking about some of the largest companies in the world, and they're obviously have smart people. They're like, you know, Nike, right? They obviously have really smart people. Their data science teams are incredible. Their analytics teams are incredible. But it's like, the source of the data aggregation that they're getting the information from, like, that's where it's broken, and that's what's like, really interesting. Just like, after talking to a lot of these companies, so really exciting stuff, you know, still working with loaded right now, we're just in the midst of trying to create that, like actual user interface to capitalize on the algorithm. So we're actually thinking, potentially, within the next couple of weeks, we'll have something publicly so super excited to like, you know, I can definitely show you that in a few weeks, when we're like, we have it out there. Yeah, people on board it, but yeah, like, our like, goal and the way that it's going to be designed, like, we're really thinking like, Bloomberg terminal style, it's got to be friendly, you know, because we're dealing with people in marketing and strategy, like, they can't stare at a black screen with, like, candlesticks, yeah. But it's like that similar style, but also kind of like cursor, you know, you have, like, your agent on the side, and you can, like, talk to it, it can manipulate the screen. That's kind of the vibe that we're going for. So super exciting, super exciting stuff. But, yeah, I mean, there's just this, this topic modeling thing was, like, so simple of an idea, and there's almost you can do with it, okay, like this is great. So really excited to just lean into that further.

Speaker 1
Makes, makes a lot of sense. Kyle, so a couple of questions. If you are already working on a product which would be facing, let's say, the initial communities that you were targeting and you're building it for loaded today. Do you plan to sort of extend that same platform for the other players?

Speaker 2
Speaker 1
in the end, said it just sounds like a very powerful engine. But then there's another piece for you that you I'm assuming, that you still have to build where and you will be combining the external data that you have from your top to the internal data. How are you thinking about that? So we've already
in the end, said it just sounds like a very powerful engine.

all the people that we need to at, like
all the people that we need to at, like
all the people that we need to at, like
all the people that we need to at, like
Speaker 2
Speaker 1
off. That makes sense. That makes sense, and it does make a lot of sense for you to not raise the round back then, when you just had an API, versus putting all of these together, having initial signs of a strong revenue pipeline and then raising a bigger round later on. Yeah, that'll give you a much better traction and launch point.
off. That makes sense. That makes sense, and it does make a lot of sense for you to not raise the round back then, when you just had an API, versus putting all of these together, having initial signs of a strong revenue pipeline and then raising a bigger round later on.

Speaker 2
We also think we might try and get so, like, there's a lot of agents are really interested in what we're doing. Are you familiar with like, publicist, publicist group? No, you should look them up. So they're technically out of parents. I believe, I think they're they do around $13 billion annually. But basically the agency world is kind of incestuous to where there's like parent group, yeah, and they own like 20 different agencies who own like 20 different agencies, etc. So we've been starting to talk to a lot of the agencies and like that, mid and bottoms here, a lot of them are actually out of Chicago. This is basically what they get paid to do. So if you're a large brand, you have.

Speaker 2
I'm doing right now is I'm meeting with, like, a lot of, like, the executives at these agencies and trying to get them involved in some capacity. Because if we get them involved, then we're we're speeding up everything of what we're doing in terms of, like, capital, they will introduce us to brands. So right now my focus is actually, like, these agencies work with the biggest companies on planet Earth. We get them involved somehow, then we're pretty much just on, like, a fast track for what we need to do in terms of selling because, like, you know, they're incentivized to make those introductions. So that's actually what I'm thinking of doing in the near term. Absolutely,
I'm doing right now is I'm meeting with, like, a lot of, like, the executives at these agencies and trying to get them involved in some capacity.

So that's actually what I'm thinking of doing in the near term. Absolutely,
Speaker 1
Kyle that that makes a lot of sense. There's also parallels that I see with multiple other workflows down the line in the AI world, wherein the agencies of the world, the current workflow owners of the world, are using AI to augment themselves today, but the solutions that they're using today have the closest view into their workflow. So tomorrow, something like a safety would completely automate them. So that gives you a very close insight. Yeah, are

Speaker 2
you familiar with, is it hebia, yes. Okay, so, I mean, what they're doing is a lot of, like the grunt work for knowledge workers in, you know, private equity, legal, banking, things of that sort. Essentially, what I'm realizing that we're kind of doing is, like a very similar style of a product, but just in, like, the marketing world where, or like, the strategy world, the branding, like all that sort of stuff, is a very similar concept of, like, it's basically software enabled services at the end of the day, there's retainers, there's consultants, there's strategists, all these people use tools to aggregate data and then they do The actual work. It's like, okay, now that I've used, like, a social listening tool to gather my data, I download it to Excel, you know, I do, like, the manual analysis. I build a PowerPoint that's actually where the majority of the work is. It's just a service, and they're using tools to get the data. So that's where I think, like, we're kind of entering that space. Now that we're building out the application, it's starting to evolve into something like that, where it's like, okay, we're not automating their work. We're just making it a lot easier and a lot faster, absolutely. So

Speaker 1
Speaker 2
It definitely can. But I don't want to take business away from us. Is a company that I do know of because we were trying to we were talking to the MBA, yeah, actually, let me send you this in the chat, because they, they're they're more plugged in on, like, the strategic side of how are you tracking these actual conversions? And from what I can tell, they do a decent job. So let me just put this in the chat, because they focus specifically on sports. That's why I'm bringing them up. Like they only use sports conversions tracking. Campaign, you know, performance. It's called rela metrics, yeah, I would check them out, actually, for that very specific use cases. I think they do a pretty good job at that. Very interesting.
It definitely can. But I don't want to take business away from us.

I think they do a pretty good job at that. Very interesting.
Speaker 1
That's great Kyle, and so that makes sense a fundraising round, probably later this year. So keep me posted on how that goes, and happy to connect you to any people. Meanwhile, media, I'm sure they are interesting folks. I know they found a close to account, happy to connect you to them. And one quick question. So I'm coming across a lot of companies in the Video Intelligence space. I know topic modeling, as you had today, was more around the comments and the social media threats, things like that. Any plan to expand it to Video Intelligence?

Speaker 2
Yeah, 100% that's what we're being asked to do right now. So actually, it's connected with a new founder, like these scribes. I can't remember exactly what company name was, but basically they do, you know, video intelligence, just like doing API. So we might actually just, it was kind of like a build or buy thing for us. We might actually just buy from the get go internally, once we have more resources. But the cool thing about that is we want to do topic modeling based on the descriptions of videos themselves. So usually what like these video analytics tools do is they do like, entity recognition. So it's like, if there's a brand logo behind me that'll say, like, oh, like Starbucks was in there. And then they're like, transcribing what I'm saying. So it's like, video plus audio intelligence. But once you have both of those things written down, now it's text like, that's what we can do, and like, that's we'll do the topic modeling essentially over, like, the metadata, over the over the video and audio. So we want to do the exact same thing, because after it's like, kind of transcribed and formatted in a way to be processed,
Yeah, 100% that's what we're being asked to do right now. So actually, it's connected with a new founder, like these scribes.

Speaker 1
data is there, I'm sure if you're talking to Tiktok, that must be on your channel pipeline. I spoke to this one company called viral moment. I kind of do the same thing around video intelligence.

sounds great. Kyle, thanks a lot for your time today. Keep you posted. I'll send I'll connect you to viral moment and let me know anything else I can do from my end. Sure. All right, cool. Pretty fun.

sounds great. Kyle, thanks a lot for your time today. Keep you posted. I'll send I'll connect you to viral moment and let me know anything else I can do from my end. Sure. All right, cool. Pretty fun.
Hey, man, hey, hi, Kyle. How's it going? Bro,
Speaker 1
pretty good, pretty good. Been some time since we spoke, I'm sure the great updates,
Speaker 2
yeah, it's been a couple months. Yes,
yes. Other things, what are you working on now?
Speaker 2
Good, good. I mean, we've been so deep in honestly, like, more of, like, the ML research stuff. Over the past couple of months, we realized, like, there was just so much alpha in the topic modeling stuff. So we've actually been, I'm actually meeting a few guys that work in trading here in Chicago. So, like, I don't feel familiar, you know, like Citadel securities trading, all the quants basically do very similar processes for trading algorithms, which is like, so different. So meeting with these guys and just seeing, like, where we can really improve this, and hopefully, like, we can get them to join the team, like, that's actually my end goal. You know in theory, they're like some of the best guys you know in the world, from like a mathematics perspective. So really leading into, like that topic, modeling stuff, and kind of see the product evolving to being sort of like Bloomberg, but for like, culture and social and it's like we're taking a really unique approach. So very exciting. That's
Speaker 1
that's very interesting, Kyle, and I agree, there's so much alpha in the space, if you can just structure and present the entire social information, which is so unstructured everywhere, exactly,
Speaker 2
dude, it's crazy. Like, I mean, we're talking about some of the largest companies in the world, and they're obviously have smart people. They're like, you know, Nike, right? They obviously have really smart people. Their data science teams are incredible. Their analytics teams are incredible. But it's like, the source of the data aggregation that they're getting the information from, like, that's where it's broken, and that's what's like, really interesting. Just like, after talking to a lot of these companies, so really exciting stuff, you know, still working with loaded right now, we're just in the midst of trying to create that, like actual user interface to capitalize on the algorithm. So we're actually thinking, potentially, within the next couple of weeks, we'll have something publicly so super excited to like, you know, I can definitely show you that in a few weeks, when we're like, we have it out there. Yeah, people on board it, but yeah, like, our like, goal and the way that it's going to be designed, like, we're really thinking like, Bloomberg terminal style, it's got to be friendly, you know, because we're dealing with people in marketing and strategy, like, they can't stare at a black screen with, like, candlesticks, yeah. But it's like that similar style, but also kind of like cursor, you know, you have, like, your agent on the side, and you can, like, talk to it, it can manipulate the screen. That's kind of the vibe that we're going for. So super exciting, super exciting stuff. But, yeah, I mean, there's just this, this topic modeling thing was, like, so simple of an idea, and there's almost you can do with it, okay, like this is great. So really excited to just lean into that further.
Speaker 1
Makes, makes a lot of sense. Kyle, so a couple of questions. If you are already working on a product which would be facing, let's say, the initial communities that you were targeting and you're building it for loaded today. Do you plan to sort of extend that same platform for the other players?
Speaker 2
Speaker 1
in the end, said it just sounds like a very powerful engine. But then there's another piece for you that you I'm assuming, that you still have to build where and you will be combining the external data that you have from your top to the internal data. How are you thinking about that? So we've already
all the people that we need to at, like
Speaker 2
Speaker 1
off. That makes sense. That makes sense, and it does make a lot of sense for you to not raise the round back then, when you just had an API, versus putting all of these together, having initial signs of a strong revenue pipeline and then raising a bigger round later on. Yeah, that'll give you a much better traction and launch point.
Speaker 2
We also think we might try and get so, like, there's a lot of agents are really interested in what we're doing. Are you familiar with like, publicist, publicist group? No, you should look them up. So they're technically out of parents. I believe, I think they're they do around $13 billion annually. But basically the agency world is kind of incestuous to where there's like parent group, yeah, and they own like 20 different agencies who own like 20 different agencies, etc. So we've been starting to talk to a lot of the agencies and like that, mid and bottoms here, a lot of them are actually out of Chicago. This is basically what they get paid to do. So if you're a large brand, you have.
Speaker 2
I'm doing right now is I'm meeting with, like, a lot of, like, the executives at these agencies and trying to get them involved in some capacity. Because if we get them involved, then we're we're speeding up everything of what we're doing in terms of, like, capital, they will introduce us to brands. So right now my focus is actually, like, these agencies work with the biggest companies on planet Earth. We get them involved somehow, then we're pretty much just on, like, a fast track for what we need to do in terms of selling because, like, you know, they're incentivized to make those introductions. So that's actually what I'm thinking of doing in the near term. Absolutely,
Speaker 1
Kyle that that makes a lot of sense. There's also parallels that I see with multiple other workflows down the line in the AI world, wherein the agencies of the world, the current workflow owners of the world, are using AI to augment themselves today, but the solutions that they're using today have the closest view into their workflow. So tomorrow, something like a safety would completely automate them. So that gives you a very close insight. Yeah, are
Speaker 2
you familiar with, is it hebia, yes. Okay, so, I mean, what they're doing is a lot of, like the grunt work for knowledge workers in, you know, private equity, legal, banking, things of that sort. Essentially, what I'm realizing that we're kind of doing is, like a very similar style of a product, but just in, like, the marketing world where, or like, the strategy world, the branding, like all that sort of stuff, is a very similar concept of, like, it's basically software enabled services at the end of the day, there's retainers, there's consultants, there's strategists, all these people use tools to aggregate data and then they do The actual work. It's like, okay, now that I've used, like, a social listening tool to gather my data, I download it to Excel, you know, I do, like, the manual analysis. I build a PowerPoint that's actually where the majority of the work is. It's just a service, and they're using tools to get the data. So that's where I think, like, we're kind of entering that space. Now that we're building out the application, it's starting to evolve into something like that, where it's like, okay, we're not automating their work. We're just making it a lot easier and a lot faster, absolutely. So
Speaker 1
Speaker 2
It definitely can. But I don't want to take business away from us. Is a company that I do know of because we were trying to we were talking to the MBA, yeah, actually, let me send you this in the chat, because they, they're they're more plugged in on, like, the strategic side of how are you tracking these actual conversions? And from what I can tell, they do a decent job. So let me just put this in the chat, because they focus specifically on sports. That's why I'm bringing them up. Like they only use sports conversions tracking. Campaign, you know, performance. It's called rela metrics, yeah, I would check them out, actually, for that very specific use cases. I think they do a pretty good job at that. Very interesting.
Speaker 1
That's great Kyle, and so that makes sense a fundraising round, probably later this year. So keep me posted on how that goes, and happy to connect you to any people. Meanwhile, media, I'm sure they are interesting folks. I know they found a close to account, happy to connect you to them. And one quick question. So I'm coming across a lot of companies in the Video Intelligence space. I know topic modeling, as you had today, was more around the comments and the social media threats, things like that. Any plan to expand it to Video Intelligence?
Speaker 2
Yeah, 100% that's what we're being asked to do right now. So actually, it's connected with a new founder, like these scribes. I can't remember exactly what company name was, but basically they do, you know, video intelligence, just like doing API. So we might actually just, it was kind of like a build or buy thing for us. We might actually just buy from the get go internally, once we have more resources. But the cool thing about that is we want to do topic modeling based on the descriptions of videos themselves. So usually what like these video analytics tools do is they do like, entity recognition. So it's like, if there's a brand logo behind me that'll say, like, oh, like Starbucks was in there. And then they're like, transcribing what I'm saying. So it's like, video plus audio intelligence. But once you have both of those things written down, now it's text like, that's what we can do, and like, that's we'll do the topic modeling essentially over, like, the metadata, over the over the video and audio. So we want to do the exact same thing, because after it's like, kind of transcribed and formatted in a way to be processed,
Speaker 1
data is there, I'm sure if you're talking to Tiktok, that must be on your channel pipeline. I spoke to this one company called viral moment. I kind of do the same thing around video intelligence. So if you're interested in talking to them as well and comparing a few vendors that you have to connect, you
say viral moment. Yeah, I feel like
Speaker 1
I'm sick. How old are they? Not very old. I say a few years. If I'm not wrong,
it's like,
this is very interesting.
Speaker 2
Yeah, I honestly would love to connect with these guys, just because I connected with the other company I mentioned a few days ago. Yes, seems like very similar, yeah, yeah, very, very similar company. So, yeah, I'd love to talk to these guys, for
Speaker 1
sure, for sure, absolutely. Let me. Let me make that connection. Cool. Sounds great. Let me know how when you have the general availability, I would love to look at the products of things,
Speaker 2
yeah, no, of course, of course, yeah. It's going to be literally, like, topics, what's going on in the world. Agent, on the side, you can talk to it in our kind of like food analysis thing. So, yeah, must
Speaker 1
be fun. Must be fun. And any plans of coming to SF anytime soon? Did I tell you I was just there? Oh, no. I didn't know we
Speaker 2
were. I thought you were based out of San Diego. No, some members are,
Speaker 1
but not the team. So I think you met Tushar. Tushar is also based off RFS, all of us are
Speaker 2
here. I did not know that. I assumed you guys were San Diego, dude. I was literally just there in March.
Next time you're here, let's do a lunch. Yeah, no. 100% 100%
Speaker 1
sounds great. Kyle, thanks a lot for your time today. Keep you posted. I'll send I'll connect you to viral moment and let me know anything else I can do from my end. Sure. All right, cool. Pretty fun.
How accurate was this transcription?
