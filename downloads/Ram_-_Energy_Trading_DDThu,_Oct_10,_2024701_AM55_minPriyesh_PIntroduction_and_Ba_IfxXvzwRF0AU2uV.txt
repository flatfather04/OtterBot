S Speaker 10:30Hi, hi, thanks a lot, Ram. I appreciate your time today. I know you are on a vacation in India and you did not want to do this otherwise, but I really appreciate you taking some time.

S Speaker 10:50Okay, okay, okay, that's great, man. So RAM, I'll give you a little bit context here, and probably a brief, brief background about myself before that. So I am a graduate from IIT Madras in from the 2018 batch. I was in biotechnology there, and I did my dual degree, and then went on to work in a clean tech firm called Clean Max. Maybe you have heard about them. They recruit very frequently from IIT

S Speaker 11:21with CleanMax for about three and a half years. They set up wind and solar farms, and they supply long term power purchase agreements to corporates. So I was there for some time, and then went to the US, completed my MBA, and I'm currently a VC with Qualcomm ventures, and my focus area here is mostly in AI investments and in some electricity electrification based investments. Now electrification is a very new space for us, and we haven't done a lot of investments here, but it's a area I personally quite enjoy, and I wanted to get the firm to start a practice here. So we are taking a look at a few companies, and one of the companies here that I particularly want to talk to you about, that company is creating weather prediction models. So it's a Y Combinator based company, and they have an AI model to predict whether better and faster than this. Sorry.

S Speaker 23:46so we trade in the spot market mainly, yeah, derivatives, not so much right now, but actually derivatives for energy markets. Power markets are a bit more a bit different from financial market. Derivative. Derivatives, yeah.

S Speaker 24:08yeah, essentially, whether we care completely based on weather. So weather models are moving right now with, if you, if you look at Europe and the US, yeah, there is huge penetration of renewables, so huge price fluctuations during the day, for example, in summer, when the sun in the night, the price can be, say, some 70 euros per megawatt. And as the sun comes up in the morning, and as the sun goes to the peak in the afternoon, sometimes we see in countries like Netherlands, the price crashes down to minus 200 and by minus i mean that you're getting paid to use energy there, so there's excess power. And in the evenings. Again, sun, sun goes down, there'll be a huge drop in supply suddenly and again, the price again, could spike back up to 150 sometimes even more than that, 500 years. Also the freezing cycles depends on base markets. But yes, there are several countries, basically, right now, all of Europe, the power trading is mainly driven by weather models, because for traders, as a trader, what you need is, what you need to make money is volatility. Yeah, there's vertically, only then you can make money. There's inefficient, they can make only then you can make money. So basically, you want to see the movements, the times where there are deviations from the forecast, which are used by majority of the market. So if the majority of the market thinks that there will be some X amount of solar in this in this particular hour, and it tries every time, say 100 and for some reason, I think that there won't be X there'd be 30% less solar than X amount. So according to me, the price should be more than where it's trading. Should be whatever percentage higher. So now I can take a position early on, and then I can basically get ahead of the market if I have a better solar forecast.

S Speaker 26:42are huge drivers and but then each market has its own dynamics. For example, UK is not very okay. They have a lot of solar as well, but as a percentage of demand, wind carries more weightage than solar in the UK, whereas in a market like Netherlands, they have much higher solar compared to wind. Yeah. So in that market, solar carries much more weightage, so each market has its own, only little quartz so but the common thing is, all the trading is done based on weather focus, and traders make money if they have better focus. That's as simple as that
are huge drivers and but then each market has its own dynamics. For example, UK is not very okay.

S Speaker 27:55so electricity trading, if you want to compare the market sizes, yeah, essentially, it's the volume traded is equal to the demand of that particular market. So not sure if the demand of you, I think the demand of us, is more than all of Europe come I'm not sure, but I'd say with Europe is when I talk to talk about Europe, I'm talking about all of continental Europe and the UK. So I'm guessing combined, they're more than, say, USA individually, or maybe a Japan individually. I think China is probably the biggest market. I think they're, they're the biggest uses of electricity, followed by us, followed by India, I think

9:08which makes it easy to trade, but at the same time,
which makes it easy to trade, but at the same time,
which makes it easy to trade, but at the same time,
which makes it easy to trade, but at the same time,
S Speaker 29:12it increases the efficiency of the market, hence less money to make. Whereas there are some markets which are opaque, which are easy to trade, sorry, car key trade, but easy to make money in, right? Then you have to risk a lot to make X amount of money, yeah, but it's very inefficient market. And there are some markets which, some markets which are straight up manipulated, also by basically one entity, one or two entities who basically the government. So especially in India market like India, yeah, the government sets the prices and everything you need, you need some some some characteristics in the market. For example, a market should have something called one volume of value of loss load. For example, in India, you see power cuts happening, right? Yeah. But there is, there is no penalty on a power cuts. Customers are like, Okay, fine. But in UK, in the UK, if our power is cut, then the customers essentially have to be paid. And they have to be paid. The penalty is very, very high. So the electricity system is very, very efficient over there, so people are very conscious about delivering what they come What, what, whatever they've sold in the market. So essentially, power plant. They sell power in the market. We have to produce it. So the penalties for not producing it, producing that power are high in Europe, Europe and the US, compared to market like India, where their penalties are not that high. Essentially, the power producer is government, like NTPC or nhcp or Advani power or Tata Power, whereas, yeah, and there's no established penalty mechanism for not producing their commitment. So that's why the quality of power is very poor in India, whereas it's much better than the US and the UK. Though, India is a bigger market, I think electricity trading volume is not that big compared to Europe or us or Japan and China is also opening up recently, so that is also going to be a much bigger market. One thing is, electricity markets are very, very important. Actually, that's one that Modi government tried to do. Unfortunately, I think our reforms were not very well received. Basically, with earlier they used to be coal plant or gas plant, all these plants.
it increases the efficiency of the market, hence less money to make. Whereas there are some markets which are opaque, which are easy to trade, sorry, car key trade, but easy to make money in, right?

S Speaker 212:08it can't be stored. Unlike other commodities like gas or petrol, you can store them when you have excess, excess that you can draw from the storage when you have deficits. Whereas power, you can't do that every time the grid, there is less storage. The batteries are very expensive, exactly. So there's no copper storage mechanism in power. You have to always the demand is equal to supply. So there is algorithm or people behind the scenes making sure that the supply and demand is always matched. That makes power a very unique commodity in the way it should be delivered. So when you introduce earlier, it used to be a few power plants controlled by the government. They know what the demand would be, mostly during this time of the day, at this time of the year, they roughly know from their past, and they have a small margin. And on top of it, they can adjust depending on, let's say if the temperature is unusually hot, so people will turn on AC, so the demand might be higher, so they would prepare for this higher

That makes power a very unique commodity in the way it should be delivered. So when you introduce earlier, it used to be a few power plants controlled by the government. They know what the demand would be, mostly during this time of the day, at this time of the year, they roughly know from their past, and they have a small margin. And on top of it, they can adjust depending on, let's say if the temperature is unusually hot, so people will turn on AC, so the demand might be higher, so they would prepare for this higher
S Speaker 213:34power. But now, so the volatility was mostly from the demand side. But now, when you have renewables in the picture, there's volatility from from the supply side also. So that makes the market very wild to be controlled by just one person or one one algorithm efficiently. That's why you need the market to be able to forecast everything. Everyone is improving the forecast all the time so that you are able to better forecast these predict these deficits or surpluses and the market will go in such a way that these deficits and surpluses are balanced out. So you need proper functioning markets to be able to properly do energy transition. So that's where the role of forecast becomes very, very important meteorology, and these things are not very well studied in India originally, if no one cares about okay, if you're a meteorologist, yeah, no one cares, right? Whereas, if you're from IIT engineer, Oh, wow. People, that's how, that's how people react, right? Then, in the world of energy trading, meteorologists are the most sought after people. If you have one good met meteorologist,

S Speaker 117:03Yeah, understood, and RAM, So correct me. If I'm wrong here, I was thinking that for most of the future contract a trading firm would probably trade for a period of days. I'm not sure if this works that way, but let's say you buy a futures contract for the price for an entire month. And in that case, the price volatility, the volatility gets averaged out. So I'm assuming weather would not be that big a factor there then.
Yeah, understood, and RAM, So correct me. If I'm wrong here, I was thinking that for most of the future contract a trading firm would probably trade for a period of days.

So I'm assuming weather would not be that big a factor there then.
S Speaker 217:33So I'll give you an example. Weather would actually still be a big factor, because in the case of, let's say UK. In the UK, in the winters, there'd be a lot of heating demand, so the demand would be off the charts, and in the summer, demand would be very low. But UK also has this particular characteristic that it has a lot of wind plants and offshore wind plants installed. And in winters there are a lot of storms which are not there in summer. So luckily for the UK, so when the demand is high, the average wind for the whole month is high in the winter months, so they have excess demand, but they also have more supply, which keeps the price down without, without, if the wind was not there, right? So, so there are average levels of wind and solar for each month, right? Yeah, in the winters, the sunlight will be there for only, like eight hours in a day, whereas in the summer, it's probably 14 hours in a day in the in the northern latitudes, right? So in summer, the prices will be low, mainly because solar averages it out. In winter, prices will become high because of demand, but if, on average, the winds are also much higher in the winter, yeah, so the prices are sort of suppressed than if wind was not there. So you the role of good predictions is to predict how cold this winter is going to be, how windy the winter is going to be, that also and also, temperatures can really roll as well, not just wind and solar, but prediction of temperature in a particular city. For example.
So I'll give you an example. Weather would actually still be a big factor, because in the case of, let's say UK. In the UK, in the winters, there'd be a lot of heating demand, so the demand would be off the charts, and in the summer, demand would be very low. But UK also has this particular characteristic that it has a lot of wind plants and offshore wind plants installed. And in winters there are a lot of storms which are not there in summer. So luckily for the UK, so when the demand is high, the average wind for the whole month is high in the winter months, so they have excess demand, but they also have more supply, which keeps the price down without, without, if the wind was not there, right? So, so there are average levels of wind and solar for each month, right? Yeah, in the winters, the sunlight will be there for only, like eight hours in a day, whereas in the summer, it's probably 14 hours in a day in the in the northern latitudes, right? So in summer, the prices will be low, mainly because solar averages it out. In winter, prices will become high because of demand, but if, on average, the winds are also much higher in the winter, yeah, so the prices are sort of suppressed than if wind was not there.

19:39Take France, France,
S Speaker 219:42the northern part Paris is in the northern part. Generally, the northern part tends to be very cool. The southern part tends to be very hot. There can be some instances where, especially right now, during this time of the year, where there is a transition from summer to winter, the South could still be warm enough to warrant AC usage. And the North could be so cold that there would be heating usage as well. Yeah. So the demand will be very, very high compared to these sometimes in some days. Yeah. So it's very important to get the, get the temperature ratios also right on region, based on the region. So that's how sensitive to give an example, every one degree change in template changes the demand by 500 megawatts in the UK grid. This is the fact published by published by the grid. So 500 megawatts, to put in context is like, I think our homes use 2000
the northern part Paris is in the northern part. Generally, the northern part tends to be very cool. The southern part tends to be very hot. There can be some instances where, especially right now, during this time of the year, where there is a transition from summer to winter, the South could still be warm enough to warrant AC usage.

S Speaker 220:52it's very low. I think five, 500 megawatts is like half a million homes or something,
it's very low. I think five, 500 megawatts is like half a million homes or something,
it's very low. I think five, 500 megawatts is like half a million homes or something,

20:57right, right? So the volatility,
right, right? So the volatility,
right, right? So the volatility,
right, right? So the volatility,
S Speaker 221:02yeah, so, so there is a lot of value getting that one degree prediction, also right one degree centigrade in temperature and in wind. Also, there is a lot of value in predicting what the wind would be doing in the next one hour, in the next one day, the next one month as well. Because, yes, it averages it out, there will be periods of very high prices and very low prices because of low and high winds respectively. But on an average, if the wind is high, higher compared to a month, compared to its previous month, yeah, the supply would be more in the next month, right? So hence, the prices should be low for a human level of
yeah, so, so there is a lot of value getting that one degree prediction, also right one degree centigrade in temperature and in wind. Also, there is a lot of value in predicting what the wind would be doing in the next one hour, in the next one day, the next one month as well. Because, yes, it averages it out, there will be periods of very high prices and very low prices because of low and high winds respectively.

But on an average, if the wind is high, higher compared to a month, compared to its previous month, yeah, the supply would be more in the next month, right? So hence, the prices should be low for a human level of

22:11these intensities, right?
these intensities, right?
these intensities, right?
these intensities, right?
S Speaker 222:16would say most of the trading happens based on this more than the short term markets, yeah, I would say for for all the trading houses, these long term trades are much they have much bigger volume, right? You create for the whole month, or the whole quarter, the entirety of winter, yeah, so the stake is much higher over there. So you need to get the prediction right. Got it. If you have betting on something, you have to really make sure that your bet is red, otherwise you could lose millions. So essentially, in these trades, you bet millions, and you you you can make
would say most of the trading happens based on this more than the short term markets, yeah, I would say for for all the trading houses, these long term trades are much they have much bigger volume, right?

S Speaker 223:01the pet is in millions only. So for a trading company, it's much more important to get that right than the short term thing. But then if you're able to get a short term thing right, then only, then you can get the long term thing also right.
the pet is in millions only. So for a trading company, it's much more important to get that right than the short term thing. But then if you're able to get a short term thing right, then only, then you can get the long term thing also right.
the pet is in millions only. So for a trading company, it's much more important to get that right than the short term thing. But then if you're able to get a short term thing right, then only, then you can get the long term thing also right.

S Speaker 223:37which goes behind the scenes. There are so many things. Example, if there's any football match in the UK, right at right when the match starts, you see a big crash in demand. And because everyone is stopping everything, what they're doing and they're coming and just watching the TV, yeah, and right at halftime, they give big, huge spike in demand, 500 megawatts to one gigawatt. Because everyone is taking a break, everyone is turning

S Speaker 224:13lot of things, lot of lights on, turn on. So the demand spikes and again crashes within the next five minutes before the second half starts again. Wow. So you have all these peculiar patterns where there's a lot of value in circulating and getting them right.

S Speaker 226:26these guys, they tend to dominate whatever they do, because they have nearly an expertise. So it's like the Silicon Valley of energy trading, Denmark basically called Lagos. Yeah,
these guys, they tend to dominate whatever they do, because they have nearly an expertise. So it's like the Silicon Valley of energy trading, Denmark basically called Lagos. Yeah,

S Speaker 126:44so, so RAM for spot trading. Like, do you trade in five minute period, 10, 515, an hour? How does that work?
so, so RAM for spot trading. Like, do you trade in five minute period, 10, 515, an hour? How does that work?
so, so RAM for spot trading. Like, do you trade in five minute period, 10, 515, an hour? How does that work?
so, so RAM for spot trading. Like, do you trade in five minute period, 10, 515, an hour? How does that work?
S Speaker 326:52Yeah, so essentially
S Speaker 227:01essentially the training can start from any, any time frame. The shortest time frame you can do is you can trade. So, so there will be contracts for it. Let's say you go in, if the day starts on your screen. Let's say intraday trading, yeah. Essentially what it means is you are trading for that particular day. On that day, you will be seeing different different contracts for different different time. So there will be some contracts which are for our two hour contracts, maybe four hour contracts, maybe eight hour contracts as well. And there's something called Days load, which is for the whole day, right? So one contract for the whole day. It's like bundling all the hours, so hours and that days load should be equal to the average of all the hours which are trading
essentially the training can start from any, any time frame. The shortest time frame you can do is you can trade. So, so there will be contracts for it. Let's say you go in, if the day starts on your screen. Let's say intraday trading, yeah. Essentially what it means is you are trading for that particular day.

28:01understood, if it's
S Speaker 228:03not equal, then there's an arbitrage opportunity. If you have a bot, you can, you can actually do that arbitrage so it can be broken up into any any
not equal, then there's an arbitrage opportunity. If you have a bot, you can, you can actually do that arbitrage so it can be broken up into any any
not equal, then there's an arbitrage opportunity. If you have a bot, you can, you can actually do that arbitrage so it can be broken up into any any

S Speaker 228:23time is dependent on the market. It's called imbalance settlement period. It's different in different markets. For example, in the UK, the imbalance settlement periods 30 minutes, whereas in the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, some of the most European countries is 15 minutes. In France, it's still 30 minutes. But they're also changing to 15 minutes in 2025, right? So the concept is, you, everyone can trade. This is the smallest time unit. They can trade in these, these, these, and they can, if you're if you're not closing your position, you are going to imbalance. Imbalance that. Let's there are two types of traders, physical and non physical, right? So physical traders are the ones with assets. Non physical are the ones without assets. So what not what a physical trader does? Let's say, if I have a power plant, yeah, what I would do is I would wait for the market to give me the highest price. If I think that the market is going to move up, then I would wait. I would wait for the market to come up and then sell my power and then produce, generate. So by selling, I'm short, right? Yeah, but, and when the delivery starts, I produce the power, and when I, when I produce the power, I will be long, right? So my short and the long will be canceled, and my, if I produce what I what I sold in the market, then my imbalance position would be zero.

S Speaker 230:24So imbalance price, so what? There will be a balancing mechanism in the market, essentially for every period, every every quantum ISP, imbalance settlement period, the grid sees if the demand is more than supply, or supply is more than demand, if the demand is more than supply, the price will be high, and if the supply is more than demand, the price will be low in the balanced market, ideally. So if I think that supply is going to be more than demand. Let's say if I think the wind is going to go up and the demand or the demand is going to crash because of whatever reason. Say temperature is going to increase, making it warmer in winter. If I think that the supply is going to supply and demand are going to relatively increase and decrease respectively, then I would would shorten the market, hoping that I would get a better price, or betting that I would be getting a better price. In the imbalance, in the imbalance mechanism, vice versa, if I think that the market, if the imbalance in the imbalance is going to be deficit of certain deficit of certain deficiency of supply, then I would be buying in the market, in the market right now, spot market, credit market, yeah. And I would take it to imbalance, and then I would get a better the grid. Would be buying essentially from me at that price. Understood
So imbalance price, so what?

S Speaker 232:01trading for each each imbalance settlement period closes at a certain time. So in the UK, it's 15 minutes before the delivery starts for half an hour. So each market has its own rules. In Germany, you could trade it even after, even during delivery and after the delivery as well, there is something called aftermarket product also, essentially, you know the delivery, you know the prices. And even then you can trade the buyers and sellers who still do the trades. There are different incentives for different participants. Yeah, if you want to know whether we can get into it, but I think it's much more finer thing, which you don't really need. Yeah,

S Speaker 233:09Yes, we have a bit of both. I think every company has a bit of both. Yeah, every company uses some external providers. But also every company also has maps and in house predictions, models and all these things

S Speaker 233:32So basically the concept is, if everyone thinks this is what the wind is going to be, and that's how the wind delivers, then essentially there's no there's no inefficiency in the market, so there's no money, so you don't trade that, but the value comes when you have a different view compared to the market, and the wind is going to be more or less, sun is going to be more or less, or the demand is going To be more or less right, you just see these three things for this. So essentially, you need to see what the market thinks. So essentially, you need an external forecast, which the market uses widely. And you also need your own internal focus to see where the deviations are.

And secondly, in the sales page, let's say if they can show us some instances where they predicted something which the rest of the market did not predict. Right? If they can, if they can improve that with case studies and essentially, every every product we come across, they have to give us a free trial. Otherwise. Yeah, right to see how good it is. Otherwise not. Majority companies would pay for it right away.

Do you sign, like, let's say, year long contracts with these weather providers? Got it. And typically, roughly speaking, I know you cannot tell me the numbers, but how big a contract this would be?

So if you're late compared to another provider, then if you lose value, if you live by even, say, 20 minutes, the market would have traded out which it would have been caught. Is also very, very important. How fast can you convert? So what these guys do is, some of these guys, for example, my desk. What they do is they take various other data providers. So you have EC, UK Met Office. You have something called icon, which is basically a German Met Office. Yeah, you have a bunch of these. These guys, they promote. They publish, okay, in this location, in this latter and longitude is what temperature is going to be, pressure is wind is going to be, is what the pressure level at this site is going to be? They publish all these models. And what this met as guys do, is they have their own tele models of the location of wind plant and solar plants. And they take the fundamental metadata and they convert it to a metabolocycle. And this conversion is all very difficult task. Technically, involves a lot of estimation, right? So it's a lot of machine learning models and a lot of latency which can come with it. So computing speed is also important part. So most companies, they have their own own internal models to beat this med desk forecast. They try to take this data directly from videomatics,

S Speaker 141:03Can you give me a rough idea of how, how much AUM you sort of manage, and how many energy trading desks? I think I can give you some number of tests. Like, let's say, if this model company is selling to cobblestone, how many customers would it have? In a sense,

S Speaker 241:28what people do is they generally give one administrator, and an administrator can add a maximum number of trading accounts, so each one is different. What some people do is they just use the API. They just use the API with their own tools, in their own tools, so they don't need to create more accounts. So some people charge for API calls, very many different cases, but no one the most important thing is the forecast. All these things are second. There's no point for a company, for energy forecasting company, to optimize on these things. If you have the best forecast, everyone would be more than you can ever make on these small things. Got

42:24here is the grids also they,
here is the grids also they,
here is the grids also they,
here is the grids also they,
S Speaker 242:28they sometimes use these forecast providers. So if you can, if a company can sell to the grid their forecasts, and somehow the market also knows it, then the market wants to get that focused as well, because they want to know what the grid thinks is value on that.

S Speaker 143:02and RAM. Is there any public, let's say, benchmarking platform, like we have for AI models. There are defined benchmarks, like for weather forecast.

No matter how good a forecast you give to a bad trader, he or she can't make money. Ultimately, if the contradiction here is that everyone is looking for the next best forecast, no one is completely satisfied with the focus. So that's one challenge in this industry that you have to always keep working, keep improving your models. Be it, if you step back, then you will be very easily using some clients,

S Speaker 144:42Got it from I think those were all the questions on my end, like maybe one last follow up question. I promise it won't take more than a minute. Are extreme weather event predictions, like cyclones? Hurricanes? Are those important for your job, and if there is a model which does that better than anyone else, would that make you adopt them?

If, not, no matter who claims that it can be predictable, it's very difficult to do it's very difficult to predict what the storm would be doing. If you could do that, you have much better things to do than forecasting energy prices. Right? You can save a lot of lives. You could do that properly. You could, you could save in billions of property damage if you could do it properly. But you can't do that, whether to think about whether it's a chaotic sign. So you can't, there's always the uncertainty around it, and that answer is, what makes money or lose? Lose make you lose money. So, so, yeah, if anyone claims that, okay, they print this very, very accurately. I would be cautious. Maybe they're trying to oversell. But at the same time, if you could do it then, yeah, of course I'd be happy to be proven wrong Absolutely.

That's why they're the number one, or that they're so dominating. There are many secretive commodity trading space which you would not have heard of unless you look at it deeply. But commodities space is very, very a lot of shady business practices, shady deals. But then this is where the money comes from. The wealth of any country comes from its commodities.

S Speaker 149:16for sure, for sure. So what's the plan for you? Like, do you plan to be in this space for a long time. Do you plan to do something of your own down the line? How you're thinking about it? For me, I
for sure, for sure. So what's the plan for you? Like, do you plan to be in this space for a long time. Do you plan to do something of your own down the line? How you're thinking about it? For me, I

S Speaker 249:58I'm happy with lesser paying less, less stressful job after a while. Yes, that's what money is, right after you get a certain amount, and you don't want to prefer other things of money. I think that's the kind of mindset I've been I probably will work for maybe two or three years over here. And if I can, if I want to, I want to take some risks at some other time. Yeah, so I want to start my own thing, not necessarily in this space right, probably much more efficient, more inefficient markets money, what we should look for, is, what I understood, is, you need to keep looking for inefficient, inefficient markets. So you look for innovation market, go in there, either monopolize it or work in it so that it till it becomes efficient. And then you look at the find the next inefficient market. I think that's my personal business philosophy, I would say all that don't have any businesses so far. That's how I would look at
I'm happy with lesser paying less, less stressful job after a while. Yes, that's what money is, right after you get a certain amount, and you don't want to prefer other things of money. I think that's the kind of mindset I've been I probably will work for maybe two or three years over here. And if I can, if I want to, I want to take some risks at some other time. Yeah, so I want to start my own thing, not necessarily in this space right, probably much more efficient, more inefficient markets money, what we should look for, is, what I understood, is, you need to keep looking for inefficient, inefficient markets. So you look for innovation market, go in there, either monopolize it or work in it so that it till it becomes efficient. And then you look at the find the next inefficient market. I think that's my personal business philosophy, I would say all that don't have any businesses so far. That's how I would look at

S Speaker 151:05it. But that's a very interesting thought Raman, and we should talk about it sometime. But I agree to that so much the like the word I personally like to use is information asymmetry, and that's basically what an inefficient market is. And I see so many AI companies today trying to work on these unstructured data sets that in the past, because these data sets were all unstructured and you cannot make sense out of it, and hence, the market was very inefficient. Because of this, the market would get efficient. And that's that's an interesting thought, and you have sort of spied my curiosity. Again, I would go. Maybe sometime over the weekend, take a broader look at everything that's going on in the market, where. everything that's going on in the market. Where are the unstructured data sets placed? What kind of places could there be an opportunity to make an efficiency play, but that's interesting. I'll probably come back to you sometime, and would like to have a conversation here. Yeah, sure.
