S Speaker 10:09okay once they have it, then they can sell to these markets. And and then the next story is if they sell to these markets, then there is a potential of creating a market or solving an existing market and then that markets as a bottoms up analysis could look like this. And of course, it could grow from there but could look like this and we do we have a story that date I think getting that would be and then the having I remember you were going to send me something for Albert, right.

S Speaker 20:50Yeah, I was going to do in you know, so I just have to compile it. Okay. I was doing the bottoms of market analysis. Tushar had started on it. I could come up with different segments of industries that they can target where there could be a potential for them to sell. I could come up with top companies in that area. And I could come up with some estimations of how much they could be spending on models right now. But then I guess, I hit a wall when I was supposed to create do that entire analysis of how many API calls per camera per day kind of thing. That's where I'm stuck. But yeah, I'll spend some time over the weekend to do that.

S Speaker 11:33And if that's the question, then you need to come up with a list of questions that we need to answer in order to get there. And let's go address those questions asap. With these guys, or we have access to companies like Spotify, who can answer that for us.

S Speaker 13:29they will be able to go sell to these types of companies in each one of these. And there is a market for these types of companies. And that's the size of the market for these types of companies if you sell to them, right. That's the story. And then then the next story is, is this the right team to go build this? What are the risks that are involved in order to go build this, right?

S Speaker 14:03how do we get comfort that these guys will be able to de risk this right? Yeah. And I think that that's it for stage one. The storyline should be that
how do we get comfort that these guys will be able to de risk this right? Yeah. And I think that that's it for stage one. The storyline should be that

S Speaker 14:38Well, being able to like instead of putting words just words there need to make sure. Are we sure like you're saying they do not offer real time latency?

S Speaker 14:54I know. DVD photo is actually very real time.
S Speaker 15:21We need first principles are thinking of that's that's what the diligence is going to be right. That's what the stage one is going to be not their story. But our story so

S Speaker 15:55and then come up with questions. Let's ask them questions. Let's ask them to be able to come up with questions what we need answers for, right? The risk is one of the risk is of course data, right? I saw the slide that you put around data, right.
and then come up with questions. Let's ask them questions. Let's ask them to be able to come up with questions what we need answers for, right? The risk is one of the risk is of course data, right? I saw the slide that you put around data, right.

S Speaker 16:18In order to do that, you need to explain let's build one slide. Very simple slide of what our first slide is what data pipeline and look at maybe scale AI slides from from then and everything. Yeah, maybe that might have some data, which is what does a data pipeline look like? There is what type of data is required for pre training and what what is pre training what is post training? What type of data which is explained in a AI model training pipeline, which is there is a pre training phase and there is a post training phase and what is that? What is pre training mean and what is post training? What type of data can be required for pre training and what type of data is required for posting. So if ever you're missing some data in post training, then you can always fine tune with more data as you collect talk to the customers right.
In order to do that, you need to explain let's build one slide. Very simple slide of what our first slide is what data pipeline and look at maybe scale AI slides from from then and everything.

S Speaker 17:27and then, then you need to explain to them that how are they planning to collect this data? Right. So each one of those phases and pictorially represent instead of showing like pictorially represent that?
and then, then you need to explain to them that how are they planning to collect this data? Right. So each one of those phases and pictorially represent instead of showing like pictorially represent that?

S Speaker 18:37So, so it needs to have you've taken a look at it, how we have it. You need to have pictures to be able to tell the story. Right. In a slide in an executive summary specially on the right hand side, you have the right picture to tell what is this company doing? And that picture is not a stack. That picture is to tell the end user when an executive is looking at it. Think about the CEO of Qualcomm wants to get an idea of what this is not the CEO of Qualcomm is really busy has 50 other fires of customers that they're solving. They need to be able to look at it for 30 seconds and understand what this company is doing.
So, so it needs to have you've taken a look at it, how we have it. You need to have pictures to be able to tell the story. Right.

S Speaker 19:43how would you explain physically air foundation model to somebody who's looking at it for 10 seconds and pictorially just get okay this physical AI foundation model. Yeah.
how would you explain physically air foundation model to somebody who's looking at it for 10 seconds and pictorially just get okay this physical AI foundation model. Yeah.

how would you explain physically air foundation model to somebody who's looking at it for 10 seconds and pictorially just get okay this physical AI foundation model. Yeah.
S Speaker 210:08Got it. Got it. Yeah, I'll redo the entire thing. Maybe you could, if you could also give me some time to after I've done with the entire thing to also present it to you so that I can speak through it and show you what I was thinking.

the path that these guys are on? Is what physical AI?
the path that these guys are on? Is what physical AI?
the path that these guys are on? Is what physical AI?
S Speaker 111:10There going to be able to solve it from a technology perspective and our current foundation models not able to solve it. So I don't know did you take notes or were you recording the storytime when I was saying
There going to be able to solve it from a technology perspective and our current foundation models not able to solve it. So I don't know did you take notes or were you recording the storytime when I was saying

S Speaker 111:27So to go through that storyline and one slide should just be what is the what is it that current models do? What does cognitive intelligence mean? Explain with pictures and examples? What does cognitive intelligence mean? Right? Pictures and examples is what you need to explain. Right? And then and then you need to have it over there saying, what are companies that are building in that space? Opening and everybody? And then you need to explain what does physical intelligence right, and what is the state of the art there. And what are the challenges there? And how does the foundation model in that space? Hell, look at the email that I sent. You get some ideas but then you need to pictorially represent Yeah, use cases over there. Right. And then when the story rest of the story that we talked about from there and then the questions need to emerge over there, I think and then the market sizing from there is going to be critical.
