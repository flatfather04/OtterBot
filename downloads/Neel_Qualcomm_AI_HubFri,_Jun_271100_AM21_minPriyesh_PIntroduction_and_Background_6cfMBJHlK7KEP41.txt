I can't hear you. I'm sorry about that. Pretty good. Thanks a lot
S Speaker 11:44for being very excited to speak to you. I actually saw that we did that call for the auxiliary ability company, and was very curious on how are you thinking about the entire space? But maybe I'll just drop an introduction, have a chat, try to understand things better from your perspective as well. Yeah,

S Speaker 21:56I'd love to give you a little bit of background on you and hear like the tests you're working on, and then I can give you a little bit of background on me. Then I can give us a little background. I think the goal is a status or where we are right now, but
I'd love to give you a little bit of background on you and hear like the tests you're working on, and then I can give you a little bit of background on me. Then I can give us a little background. I think the goal is a status or where we are right now, but

S Speaker 23:40to you. So thank you. Yeah, so from my personal background, I started in tech. I trained neuroscientists. I did computational neuroscience. I did a lot of like image processing, things early on in my career, do the MBA, did the full pivot, got into ventures, how we then ended up, actually went to Bay Area to join one of these startups that was funded both by coastal ventures and then client of workings. So got to, like, be there and be part of sales team and see, like, how we conduct revenue with the VC expectation. It was interesting. Yeah, that's a discussion for a beer. But we, I eventually came up to Seattle following year. Really kick ass team a few people I moved back from my eight days, and then maybe bunch of new people, including Krishna. I don't know if you've met Krishna, 2016 kept in touch over the years. And then last year was like, suddenly, like, hey, this place, let's get back together and figure things out. And so, so yeah. So my intervening years really dived into animal tooling, really dive into enterprise sales partnerships. Last stop was a corporate V at Microsoft, so working with startups and other companies to really go and scale folks up in an enterprise way. So, so that's a little bit about me. The last nine months has been really interesting. So came in, I think in October we did there. Sorry, September. We did that. Last year was October. We did SES. We did the big announcements with large language model providers at the straw and much lava and a bunch of others. So when I was talking about the chart, originally, like the idea was, just get more startups in the AI hub ecosystem, because that will get the flywheel spinning. And kind of like the gaps I saw were, you know, what does it take to bring a model into AI hub? So where's your data residing? Where does your model reside all these other pieces, specifically, what models you have ready to go. So we focused on that. And then to a certain extent, focused on the end part, which is like, how do I deploy this application? We brought in partners like Noda, and partners through like, how do I actually deploy that model, at least for mobile and for compute? So we continue that conversation? Open layer is, like a good one for that to think through. You know what that sermon ability will say? I'll be honest, though, like, we're putting a pause on the open layer conversation, quite a few other conversations, because it's not clear, like we're building things without getting customer feedback. And so that's like one thing, like, I want to focus in more heavily this year. So I've been working with the views more closely to understand, like, what is it the challenges that they're seeing, and what do we need to immediately deliver on to get there? And then I'm taking some feedback from Senegal team on what, what wasn't that Tetra you know, history needs to be different. So what does the TETRA team think was missing and needs to be done? So one, one thing that Tetra is a little bit different than Qualcomm is, like, we want to create a system of applications, right? So to your point of, like, vertical specific applications, or even horizontal specific applications, what is it going to take to get there? Because, like, we know, like we can see it with Google and Apple, like having their app stores allow them to bring in a lot of folks, but like, how do we put Qualcomm first there? I think there's basically two kind of dynamically different ways we can approach this and actually putting in our favor to consider, like, inform with us. I guess there's three buckets, when I think about it, but one is the status quo, which is we continue to put customer engineers out in front of our in front of our customers. For OEMs, that will work really well, but for ISPs, like, if I really wanted to make Salesforce look welcome, that's it's not clear that emotions going to work. The other way is to get system integrators involved, and that's going to be a long slog, but at least it'll be programmatic. You know, we'll connect with their managing partners. We'll set to get a profit plans. We'll go and execute to it. We'll get strategic funding, whatever else. The third bucket is probably the most impressive. Like, can we get, like, design partners to really invest in this? And so, like, I think the one place where we've done that reasonably well is with artmax. I don't know if you've not really familiar with them. Okay, so art maps basically is like a company that is all things audible in speech. And so what they're doing is making it really easy for they're a horizontal technology, but they're realizing that there's sort of all specific applications of speech on mobile and compute. So prices and chips. AI hub provides the Whisper model, but you know, argmax is providing the SDKs for building applications, let's say, for medical, government, any sort of highly regulated industry, and so then they'll handle all the necessary handoffs, right? Because it's not just like a model with a certain context. It's like someone was actually talking about this the other day, but like they were trying to record a talk by Andre karpathy. And they're like, you know, it's too long, I can't do this. Like argmax gives you this simple way of, like, taking very long conversations and turning it into text, and conversely, taking text and putting into speech, and then you glue together like the LLM in between, right? But like so I'm trying to find startups like this now for for what we call design partners, where they have a view of like the solution they want to provide. They know that they are going to need to leverage optimized models. And then, how do we, how do we best support them? And so if I do that, then I'm gonna have to take some portfolio theory kind of similar to probably what you and Bucha are working on around, how do I source these companies? How do I validate that they're worth working with? And then, like, how do I provide them a support structure? We'll have to provide them instead having AWS and Microsoft, like, I know, like, what those startup programs look like, pretty well, we'll have to provide them something like that. So a Qualcomm Kickstart Package, some like 1288 month program, get them GTM and all this and that, and then get them with our engineers, something through, like, from a resourcing standpoint, like, which engineers can I get them with and how we're able to coach them along? But, yeah, anyway, so I've kind of rambled on here for a bit, but I think that could be an interesting area for us to collaborate on. Like I said, I'm putting together a document for third guy. I'll probably have clarity on it by end of July. I'm hoping sooner, but honestly, like so many things going on right now,
to you. So thank you. Yeah, so from my personal background, I started in tech. I trained neuroscientists. I did computational neuroscience.

S Speaker 110:13absolutely. Thanks. Thanks a lot for that overview, Neil. And then does create a lot of interesting overlaps. I'm sure in the third bucket you mentioned where arcmax fits, we had recently suggested a company called adaptive ML to Sergio, and I believe you were able to speak to them. Do you think they fit the bill? I'm just trying to sort of figure out if I'm thinking about the companies in the right way so that it fits your expectations.

S Speaker 211:06piece would be, because they're like, a lot of what they were doing was around rags to SQL, so I think we need to, like, understand that a little bit more. But I think in general, it could be like these types of companies are interesting.

11:27The other thing is,
S Speaker 211:30I think the companies that I'm looking for for design partners, they're not going to be their ideal customer is a software developer, not an AI developer, and so that's where maybe adaptive ML is probably not as interesting, because you do needs a scientist to come in and say, Okay, this is the right metric.

S Speaker 211:58it's, this is the same issue with open layer too, that I'm running into like we, if we're going to get broad adoption and get like these kind of like app store level network effects, it's from software developers

S Speaker 112:16that's that's interesting, Neil, and is it just software developers? Do you also think people like me who don't have a technical background but can sort of fiddle out with a few technical solutions, or technically or people like citizen developers, is what a lot of startups are calling them. Do you think personas like startups targeting these personas might also be useful, like I'm saying this in context to one particular company that we are discussing right now, and maybe Sergio will bring it up to you and your team soon. It's called hyper mode, and they are in agent developing ecosystem. They have a runtime, they have, but their interface is very natural language based. So people, someone like me, can go on, build an interface, build an agent through natural language, that agent can then be deployed into code, and someone from an mlops background kind of thing can sort of harden that entire agent, bring in more security, authentication, identity, things like that. But the entire platform is very natural language driven. It's targeted to subject matter experts to build agents the way they use their own workflows.

S Speaker 114:23absolutely. But otherwise, Neil, it seems like, from your background, you've been quite involved in the entire venture startup ecosystem. How does it feel to be in Qualcomm now, being in more corporate setting?

S Speaker 214:36Yeah. So I guess, like I've had, like, the first half of my career, which is very much like even my first commercial job, like it was a late stage startup we got acquired. Yeah, I genuinely, genuinely thrive in kind of smaller situation where there's a lot of focus on ownership so but then, like, I flipped that around, and AWS, Microsoft, Qualcomm, or Apple, for that matter, too, are all major enterprises.

So
S Speaker 215:15interesting each time. I think the one thing, like, when I came to Qualcomm, like, I had a startup offer in hand, and I was very much considering that one. And it was like, I'm just talking been exhausted by large companies, but if I'm falked up to be pretty good, like this small team, I find to be excellent. And like part of his familiarity, part of it is just their startup DNA,

S Speaker 215:51So, so I've enjoyed that. But like Qualcomm, more generally speaking, like, I find them quite open. Like, the show has been fantastic. Just like being able to pick his brain through what we could do to enter the BU's in general have been fairly supportive of us here and there. There's challenges, and I think some of that is just reconciling what AI hub is and what AI hub is not which you know, is the mindset shift, or like, when you're a startup, you're trying to do everything to make sure you get product market fit. When you're an enterprise, you're just trying to decrease cognitive load and saying, Okay, this block fits here, and that block fits there. So

S Speaker 217:05absolutely that's exciting, curious from your perspective, right? Like you probably had, like, a pick of things and you worked in Menlo. Why Qualcomm? Why Qualcomm ventures like and how are you enjoying it?

S Speaker 117:18Well, a very frank answer would be, I had a opportunity at one more financial fund, but Qualcomm gave me a lot more comfort around the entire visa situation to start my career with. So that was one of the decision points. Other than that, just a brand name Neil gets us into the doors of some really high valued companies. And what I've seen here, and I can't contrast that with some of my entrepreneurial experience in India. And what I see here is that there's a lot more competition to get into the cap table of a highly valued company. Capital is not really a differentiator in the Bay Area, everyone has money to deploy, and you really have to go in with a value prop. And I think Qualcomm has been a big, big addition to that perspective of speaking to founders, saying we can do XYZ for you. There's a team working on Qualcomm's AI hub. There's a team which is expanding into PC compute, and we we have a lot of platforms where we can enable you so that that at least gets us into the door and we have, we get to have conversations with some of these teams. Some of them still do not let us get allocation in their cap table, but many of them do so. I would say early on, starting my career with this sort of an experience has been really good. Down the line, maybe I would like to sort of start something of my own, or maybe start a venture fund, but But great learning experiences so far, and the team has been incredible. I have some of the members in the team you mentioned, Tushar. There's also Varsha, who has had an incredible portfolio in India. Now she's in usgc. She's doing amazing work. Albert has great experiences in AI Nan. I'm not sure if you met all of the team members, but Nan, she has extensive network in the Chinese community. So some of the members of the team also are very well established in the ecosystem, the companies that they bring in, and the learnings I get to see from some of those have been really incredible. I would say, Yeah, that's cool. We need to you're based in Seattle right now, is it? Is that?

S Speaker 120:00been Seattle yet, not yet, but a lot of my friends are there at Microsoft, at Amazon service. So there will be a trip sometime for sure. Yeah, let me know when you when you're next in Bay area. We also host the Qualcomm ventures team. We're planning to host a few set of events here, so that could be also a good place for you to come meet some of our portfolio companies, some of the companies we we have friends with, I would love to invite you to some of those events.

S Speaker 220:28I'm happy to travel and green light to travel pretty much anytime. So if we, if it makes sense, like the jar and Sergio invited me to that venture showcase. So like the robo flow conversation has gotten really well since then. So that was, like, good inserter. But also, like, if we can collaborate, to collaborate together, to figure out, like, like I said, I I want to get startups, like, more enabled. So like we did, I've done this at Microsoft right where, like, we got m 12 to write a check, and then we provided, like, some corporate resources and marketing and all of that. So I feel like we can replicate that here as well, but we just need to find the right companies where that makes sense, so I could definitely take the first step of putting together some filters for you.

S Speaker 121:17Absolutely. Neil, thanks a lot for this. This has been great, and I'm sure you would have mentioned it. But anytime, if you feel there's a company which is interesting, and if you'd like to sort of introduce them to some capital network, either at Qualcomm ventures, or even network that we have extended from our relationships with different VCs happy to sort of extend that, that'd be great. thanks me thanks a lot for your time.
