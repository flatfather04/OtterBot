S Speaker 11:32yeah, we we can lead rounds as well, although, I would say 80% of the times we participate with other investors. And then we like to have a good mix of strategic and good institutional investors as well, because in times of when the startup, you know, startup journey is lots of ups and downs. And then during down times, you want the tops of performance of AI performance, and your requirement is to be power and thermally like it's like a smartphone, right? So if you want to, you.

S Speaker 15:14then we have the best solution for that. Yeah, so, yeah. So we fit in there, and I think that pie, over the next few years we're going to see that pie for IoT increase the question, although always has been,

S Speaker 36:28all the technical like so many game emulators, yeah, and it's, I think the bottom line is, it's all own device, tree, driver, everything. You can still do that. But Arduino, this is dumb it down too much. I feel like it's more education towards towards education. But Raspberry Pi, there's like, big.

S Speaker 310:10so, okay, you know what? Let me maybe back up a little bit your background, which is, okay. What's your journey so far? And then, how did you get to this? Yeah, so we've been classified for eight years college at Purdue, we started the largest robotic club at Purdue. We had 100 people back then. Like, it's a competition hosted by DJI, the drone company. Yeah, no, yeah, they host this. It's not, like, first robotic, but we got, like, multiple type of robots, some
so, okay, you know what? Let me maybe back up a little bit your background, which is, okay. What's your journey so far? And then, how did you get to this?

S Speaker 110:39kind of fly, some have missile you have to do, like, it's very, really fun. And then back in, you know, during that club, he was the president, I'm the vice president. I was just thinking about, yeah, this is like, super cool. Well, wish we can do this, continue to do cool stuff after we graduate, you know. And, but after graduation, he went to Bucha, right? And I went to, he worked at Qualcomm, yeah,
kind of fly, some have missile you have to do, like, it's very, really fun. And then back in, you know, during that club, he was the president, I'm the vice president.

To what's the highest in Compute?
To what's the highest in Compute?
To what's the highest in Compute?
S Speaker 814:36Well, this is running on Raspberry Pi, but point five tops, yeah, so this is how many tops. This is probably below
Well, this is running on Raspberry Pi, but point five tops, yeah, so this is how many tops. This is probably below
Well, this is running on Raspberry Pi, but point five tops, yeah, so this is how many tops. This is probably below
Well, this is running on Raspberry Pi, but point five tops, yeah, so this is how many tops. This is probably below

14:49So you're running what intake
So you're running what intake
So you're running what intake
So you're running what intake
S Speaker 114:56Yeah. And we kind of, we took this to sit on many there's a couple hackers on there, yeah. And we started showing off to people. And just happened, there's, I think, last year, like July, a hardware start become popular, one? Yeah, there's whole time I quit my job at August last year. August last year, yes, oh, you were doing like COVID,
Yeah. And we kind of, we took this to sit on many there's a couple hackers on there, yeah. And we started showing off to people. And just happened, there's, I think, last year, like July, a hardware start become popular, one? Yeah, there's whole time I quit my job at August last year.

15:24all that. It's just
S Speaker 115:26Yeah. And then so the, how big is 30k
Yeah. And then so the, how big is 30k
Yeah. And then so the, how big is 30k
Yeah. And then so the, how big is 30k
15:32revenue? So which is
S Speaker 115:33you're selling this through your website, yeah, and who's making it? We can make them. All this coming from my printer. Printer, yes, yes.
you're selling this through your website, yeah, and who's making it? We can make them. All this coming from my printer. Printer, yes, yes.
you're selling this through your website, yeah, and who's making it? We can make them. All this coming from my printer. Printer, yes, yes.

15:48The picture actually on the on the side, yeah.
The picture actually on the on the side, yeah.
The picture actually on the on the side, yeah.
The picture actually on the on the side, yeah.
S Speaker 115:51And the PCB will make you want to show something you can Oh, yeah, no, I don't
And the PCB will make you want to show something you can Oh, yeah, no, I don't
And the PCB will make you want to show something you can Oh, yeah, no, I don't
And the PCB will make you want to show something you can Oh, yeah, no, I don't
15:59have USB C. No, on the other side, you should have it. This is MAC,

right? That that's not USBC. That is.
right? That that's not USBC. That is.
right? That that's not USBC. That is.
S Speaker 119:27For innovative developers, they pay up to three $300 Yeah, $300 Yeah. We, we initially, we started with 200 but like, people still buying it. And we basically 300 people still buy, yeah, it pays that much so. And then, how much does it cost right now? With, like, right now, like, you're paying 140 140
For innovative developers, they pay up to three $300 Yeah, $300 Yeah. We, we initially, we started with 200 but like, people still buying it.

19:55i the pie cost, like
S Speaker 119:59the rather pione cost the Raspberry Pi board, yes. So if you see, like the black board, this is we make this, yeah. Then this part is a compute model that they may, yeah,
the rather pione cost the Raspberry Pi board, yes. So if you see, like the black board, this is we make this, yeah. Then this part is a compute model that they may, yeah,

and this will be with our hardware. Yeah,
and this will be with our hardware. Yeah,
and this will be with our hardware. Yeah,
24:13you're, oh, you're thinking of launching in May. How do you
you're, oh, you're thinking of launching in May. How do you
you're, oh, you're thinking of launching in May. How do you
you're, oh, you're thinking of launching in May. How do you
S Speaker 724:17so launch is, like, accepting for now, shipping, yeah, you might actually get a pretty good demand for that. Yeah, yeah, you know, like, the idea is that we're gonna sell this thing as a kit with a screen everything, so people can get all of the box experience with, you know, teenage anything. You can just play with it right away, like your mom, your dad can play with it. But for more experienced developers, they can just buy them. You know, that kit even better. We want to make them som into even more deaf, friendly form factor, then we can do the same thing the red bird pie did. They can implement to their own products. The demand is like we didn't expect. I mean, we made a video about it. I don't know if you've seen a video. I saw the video pretty good. We just got too many COVID and the use cases like we didn't know it can fashion. That's the train I see, like the kids all of Berkeley on MIT, they not gonna go to work. They just go to SaaS business, those kinds of like you give them a rest.
so launch is, like, accepting for now, shipping, yeah, you might actually get a pretty good demand for that. Yeah, yeah, you know, like, the idea is that we're gonna sell this thing as a kit with a screen everything, so people can get all of the box experience with, you know, teenage anything.

Yeah, yeah, you know, like, the idea is that we're gonna sell this thing as a kit with a screen everything, so people can get all of the box experience with, you know, teenage anything. You can just play with it right away, like your mom, your dad can play with it. But for more experienced developers, they can just buy them. You know, that kit even better. We want to make them som into even more deaf, friendly form factor, then we can do the same thing the red bird pie did. They can implement to their own products. The demand is like we didn't expect. I mean, we made a video about it. I don't know if you've seen a video. I saw the video pretty good. We just got too many COVID and the use cases like we didn't know it can fashion. That's the train I see, like the kids all of Berkeley on MIT, they not gonna go to work. They just go to SaaS business, those kinds of like you give them a rest.
