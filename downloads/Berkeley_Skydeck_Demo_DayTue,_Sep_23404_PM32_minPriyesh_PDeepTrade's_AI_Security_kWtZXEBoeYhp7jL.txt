S Speaker 15:10teams can go and add policies and point those policies to these AI agents. Third, we enforce these policies and behaviors and action control at one time so that enterprises get complete end to end, visibility, governance and control. So you might think enterprises are ready for this. They are. We are already seeing lot of enterprises is real. Their developers are already on downloading things from online and other places, and we have already seen a great traction with our early customers, and we have two types of customers. One are premium customers, which are early growing team of up to 1000 employees. And we have enterprise customers with our traditional enterprises, within the early customers, we also have agentic AI companies, which are working with us very closely to deploy our product. So our early customers include Mozilla. We are also working with WellStar healthcare, company goes insurance, Stuart title, and we are also early conversations to deploy our product at writers and boss. So how big is this opportunity? We believe this is massive, and we are at the tip of this agentic world right now, which is, we're just getting started. We're in the low autonomy agentic world, and this opportunity captures the only low autonomy agentic world, which is, we believe is $50 billion opportunity, but this can be five to 10 times more as we unlock from copilots to goal oriented areas to AI agentic workforce. And our early customers are the folks who are building AI agents using open source frameworks. Have team tier or enterprise tier of anthropic cloud or charity, and they're building MCP servers to automate their internal workforce, as well as their customers. In terms of the competition, we believe the world is getting divided between auth

S Speaker 17:17on the y axis, we are talking about human based access controls versus AI action control. And we believe in this particular white space. We are the only company which has built a solution right now and for early traction. So now this is possible without the team which can deliver this. Between me and my co founder, we have each spent two decades building software from ADP, software from data, machine learning infrastructure, all the way in security products getting acquired. I came to us in 2007 for my PhD in computer science. I've worked a lot on data structure, large scale data center requirements, as well as networking, as well as security products. My co founder started his career and has been in security practitioner throughout his life, starting with Google, Fortinet, Medina and plastic talk.

S Speaker 625:33Hotel technology is terrible. I lived it. I fought with it, and every hotel loses revenue because of it, and that's where we started traversing AI. Now, most hotels are stuck on legacy software systems that were built decades ago. They can't even connect to modern APIs. But because of that, they have hotels have zero visibility into their own data. They lose bookings to third party middlemen, and it costs them hundreds of 1000s of dollars every single year. Hotels are bleeding. They're stuck with legacy software that doesn't solve their core problem. Our solution is simple. Bring hotel tech into the modern era. Traversing AI, connects those modern connects those legacy systems with modern APIs, unlocking direct bookings, revenue and actionable data, all about forcing hotels to live and replace everything that they already have. First, we're starting in Las Vegas. It's the epicenter in hospitality, and then we're taking over the rest of the world. Let's talk about some real results after implementing with the Rio in Las Vegas, in the first 90 days, abandonment rate reduced to zero with AI processing over 3000 daily calls. More than 80% of those calls will resolve without the involvement of a human, while still generating an increase in both direct booking and ancillary sales. Now, Mia would allocate more than $6 million every year to operate their contact center, but because of traversing AI, that cost was reduced by 90% traversing AI is transforming guest interactions into revenue growth, proving scalability and measurable. Roi, to date, we've achieved over two and a half million dollars. Just last week, we signed a contract with a major chain with more than 18,000 rooms. We have more than 7 million in our contracts to close by the end of this year, and 100 million in our pipeline. Overall, we've proven that when hotels adopt traversing AI, they don't just save they scale, and the demand for growth, it's never been greater. We're the only player embedding AI directly into hotel operations, ensuring hotels fully own their data, bookings and their guest relationships. Our team and our advisors have extensive experience across major resorts and grants. Hotels need a partner who understand their pain because it's there, and have the capabilities to fix it that's traversing. Ai, we're seeking $10 million to fuel our growth by three times. Join us as we redefine how hotels trans, how hotels connect and serve with their guests, the future of hospitality is traversing. Ai, thank you. Ready for a good

S Speaker 729:07Natalia, hi. My name is Natalia. I'm CEO and co founder of algarves at algorist. We are building foundational agile models that are capable to detect people presence, and we are revolutionizing the human machine interaction. When we started building this technology, which was about 12 months ago, 24 months ago, every single industry was looking for people, positioning to know how many people in this room, driver, house, child, presence, detection, elder care, but we focused on one thing for the customers that were important to make a major impact in the industry, robotics, industrial innovation, everything that's related to industrial think about the big facilities running on the low margins, so where 1% efficiency is a field of 10 million on an annual basis. We built these factories for the humans, and today, with the efficiency working by those machines and for our own safety, put them in cages. So what it means is that the true human machine interaction is really required, and not with what others who are capable to detect the human presence, the distance, velocity, and we are also capable to detect even the precinct and hard drive at a distance without wearables, and we doing it on the existing infrastructure. This is our traction for the past five months, raised $4.3 billion from the billion dollar Amazon industrial Innovation Fund and the number of wonderful institutional defects, which I can see here in both of Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. We raised 2 million in the revenues, and the past 12 months, we have three multi year contestants signed, and we've got more. We've got 60 more customers the same culture is given today 4.5 million in AR next year, and I carry out for the 10 million in 12 months. We know today how to reach 100 million in vehicles.
