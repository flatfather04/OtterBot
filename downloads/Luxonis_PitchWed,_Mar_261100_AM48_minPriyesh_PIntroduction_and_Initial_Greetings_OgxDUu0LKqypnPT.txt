S Speaker 11:10am part of the Qualcomm ventures team, so I run the North America ventures for Qualcomm ventures. And Qualcomm ventures as a fund has been around for about 25 years, and then I've been with the company for a long time. My background is an engineering product and Qualcomm, and then cameras was actually I used to be responsible for the camera business in Qualcomm prior to joining ventures. So it's been a while to almost seven, eight years, but

S Speaker 11:48looking forward to learning more about what you guys building, but Qualcomm ventures, so we invest in areas that are strategically relevant to Qualcomm. And so the definition of that over the last 25 years has changed a bunch of times, but broadly speaking, in a Qualcomm. So we invest in technologies that are pushing the boundaries of compute and connectivity, so the and then and the definition of this changes for Qualcomm over the years. So mobile was, it was mobile for a long time, and then IoT and networking and automotive and xr and many it took the form of lot of other things. And then now we have multi billion dollar businesses in many of these areas. So we invest across hardware and software across all of these

S Speaker 12:47our mandate is both financial and strategic. So we look to invest in companies that have the same financial discipline as would be for a financial investor, but at the same time, we work with companies to either in cases where they become a customer, in some cases, we become their customer. In some cases we become a channel partner, and come some cases, they become our channel partner, or in some cases, just the technology partnerships. So that's, those are the typical lens that we look at. We now, more specifically for this discussion, I mean, we've got to the way we work, is we've got certain investment thesis over every year where we spend time in as a team robotics. Is definitely one of the areas where we're spending a lot of time recently and and what piqued my interest is it seems as everybody in the industry, in the robotics industry, is using stereoscopic cameras, somebody's got to build them and supply to all of these guys so, so that's why I'm very interested in learning more. Yeah, that's and then our typical check size is anywhere from two to ten million initial check size. Our sweet spot tends to be about five to seven. And our we're series agnostic, but I would say more speaks about is series ABC. So yeah, that's the high level overview. Happy to answer more questions. We can lead and follow. We tend to participate with other investors, and then we typically like to participate with other institutional investors.

and I see logos such as figure and eptronic here. So are you also providing cameras to these companies. Yeah,
S Speaker 29:23it's a great segue to the slide here. So this is from the recent Nvidia keynote at CDs Las Vegas. And so you see Jensen black leather Jack in the center there. And then you see the humanoids everywhere, where you see a purple circle that's somebody that's a looks on his customer. And so basically, more than most of the ones that are the American providers are using luxon as or at least try this out. And then there's three customers that are in commercial production that are reordering from oxonas regularly, and those are at Tron, like on the left. So they just raised 400 million based in Austin. They're Boston Dynamics, and they're the folks that have been at this the longest. And then finally, it's bigger AI. And as you probably familiar, figure, AI is raising money right now, and they're actually the humanoid company that's purchased the most stereo cameras from us today.

10:14it's interesting. And
it's interesting. And
it's interesting. And
it's interesting. And
S Speaker 110:15this all so the stereo cameras, and so maybe Tom can answer. You can answer, which is so right now, are you using our check for the ISP, or,
this all so the stereo cameras, and so maybe Tom can answer. You can answer, which is so right now, are you using our check for the ISP, or,
this all so the stereo cameras, and so maybe Tom can answer. You can answer, which is so right now, are you using our check for the ISP, or,

yeah, yeah, currently using 8550
yeah, yeah, currently using 8550
yeah, yeah, currently using 8550
S Speaker 110:33as the baseline device. Got it and, and that's for, is that for all your stereo cameras.

S Speaker 111:25Okay. So, so that's, that's interesting, yeah. And I'm guessing you know, so the humanoids are, of course, during nascent stages. So, so these are, these guys are probably purchasing what few 100 at the most,
Okay. So, so that's, that's interesting, yeah. And I'm guessing you know, so the humanoids are, of course, during nascent stages. So, so these are, these guys are probably purchasing what few 100 at the most,

11:41right now, or Yeah, the
right now, or Yeah, the
right now, or Yeah, the
right now, or Yeah, the
S Speaker 211:43most we've had is we have, you know, been, like the 500 to 1000 pieces. But then the some of some of the other ones, like, they've only ordered in the 50 to 100 pieces that are in commercial production. And then, yeah, some of these folks are really, really gay, so they just purchased, you know, a few of them, and they're just kind of testing and evaluating. But the ones I highlighted are more in the commercial production, where they've done the larger volumes with us, 50 plus. And that's electronic figuring Boston Dynamics.
most we've had is we have, you know, been, like the 500 to 1000 pieces.

S Speaker 312:15yeah. And then the one, the other one to call out here is Neo, which is not currently lit up. But they, they're very interested in the the series four with the Qualcomm architecture. So
yeah. And then the one, the other one to call out here is Neo, which is not currently lit up. But they, they're very interested in the the series four with the Qualcomm architecture. So

Oh, 1x Oh, yeah, okay, yeah. They're very interested
Oh, 1x Oh, yeah, okay, yeah. They're very interested
S Speaker 312:41in in the Qualcomm, and they have, what we're finding is that no matter how good it, you know, Nvidia comes out with their next chip, it's just like, there's just never enough compute. And so, like the ability to add chips like this that are relatively low power, but are also very conformant and very good for these types of systems.
in in the Qualcomm, and they have, what we're finding is that no matter how good it, you know, Nvidia comes out with their next chip, it's just like, there's just never enough compute.

S Speaker 113:04Yeah, low power is there, yeah, I just met Florida. Nice yesterday. So low power is the key. The No. So, okay, so, so good. And then the ones that are currently, so, as you mentioned, you know, what is it? Intel, real sense, right?
Yeah, low power is there, yeah, I just met Florida. Nice yesterday. So low power is the key. The No. So, okay, so, so good. And then the ones that are currently, so, as you mentioned, you know, what is it? Intel, real sense, right?

13:38That's going end of life this year, right?
That's going end of life this year, right?
That's going end of life this year, right?
That's going end of life this year, right?
S Speaker 213:42So, so real senses is a competitor that provides 3d cameras, yeah. And Intel separately, had an acquisition of Movidius and, yeah. So that Movidius acquisition had a chip called married x. So it's the it's the chip that we have. That very next chip is what's the basis for, for some of these devices, and that's the chip that's going into black in 2025

but for so real sense, doesn't use mirrored X. They
S Speaker 214:09use a precursor of it. I think they were using, like myriad two. And then they have, they have some other processor that they use that I think is homegrown, outside more videos got

14:21it okay, but real sense, they're still selling.
it okay, but real sense, they're still selling.
it okay, but real sense, they're still selling.
it okay, but real sense, they're still selling.
S Speaker 214:25Yeah, real sense is still selling. And that it was actually announced at CES that real sense is this came from Intel, so just not sharing anything that's private. They said that they're planning on Intel Capital was planning on spinning it out into a standalone entity, so they announced that back at CES about three and a half months ago.
Yeah, real sense is still selling. And that it was actually announced at CES that real sense is this came from Intel, so just not sharing anything that's private.

S Speaker 114:48Okay, okay, so, so real sense is a competitor and and what about the Chinese? Or maybe you're going to talk about what's definitely up the land here? Yeah, or go ahead, yeah,
Okay, okay, so, so real sense is a competitor and and what about the Chinese? Or maybe you're going to talk about what's definitely up the land here? Yeah, or go ahead, yeah,

17:49Yeah, and, and if
S Speaker 117:53you're going to talk about the software subscription, how and has that, has that been sticky so far? Because in this industry, you know the customers, that there's certain industries where the customers are very used to paying software subscription, and there's certain where they don't want to pay a subscription, and then buying camera modules is one of those where they don't want to pay subscription. So is that something where you had stickiness?
you're going to talk about the software subscription, how and has that, has that been sticky so far?

S Speaker 318:27it's a it's an earlier product for us, and I'll skip to the next slide. So the way that we see it is, we sell, we offer three kind of different layers to our customers where they would otherwise have to go and kind of glue a bunch of things together. So we obviously offer the hardware and firmware. We have a fleet management software tool so you can just easily connect to devices, manage them, download apps, software, get data off of the devices back so that you can start to collect data, build different models, and then we have a model training and iteration software suite that allows ourselves and our customers to build models, improve them, and track them over time and make sure they don't decay as you start to deploy more and more hardware. So this is where we've we've kind of been focusing for software subscriptions, and the bottom two layers are, again, that's kind of where we're trying to grow a business. And so we, I think, for the right customer, that makes a lot of sense, because they don't, then they don't have to pay and build a lot of that stuff themselves. So I think the answer is, we'll see. But yeah, we do this will be a fast growing part of our business. And so

S Speaker 119:50the product right now, so is the see more product is, is it primarily stereo cameras, or are you also making RGB, which, which might well. And then the question for that is that commodity?
the product right now, so is the see more product is, is it primarily stereo cameras, or are you also making RGB, which, which might well. And then the question for that is that commodity?

the product right now, so is the see more product is, is it primarily stereo cameras, or are you also making RGB, which, which might well. And then the question for that is that commodity?
S Speaker 320:12Yeah, so we make, we do make, you know, kind of the single, single camera here. This is, this is based on a Qualcomm architecture, so we have to shift. We think this will be a very big growing business for us, just based on now, this puts us, you know, competing with kind of like the five to 10k cameras, MSRP, whereas this MSRP is owner of magnitude lower than that, and is, you know, just as capable, if not more capable. But today, the bread and butter has been in our in our stereo systems. But again, we differentiate a lot, because we do a lot of the AI on the stereo camera. It's not just a camera. Most stereo cameras in the market are just giving you a point cloud, and you have to have another piece of hardware connected to that to do anything AI related to, like an Intel real sense or an or back. They're not doing any any CNNs or Transformers or object detection or tracking on the actual device. And that's, that's where that's a big differentiation for us.
Yeah, so we make, we do make, you know, kind of the single, single camera here. This is, this is based on a Qualcomm architecture, so we have to shift.

21:09Got it? Okay? Yeah.
S Speaker 321:15And then, you know, I won't dive too much into our roadmap, but we do like to just kind of highlight the kind of the four main things that we feel customers are always going to want and aren't really changing. As you know, the landscape the technology is constantly changing, so they always want more compute. Like, again, I've never talked to an engineer that said, like, Yeah, we don't need any more compute. We're totally good on that. Higher resolution is always something that our customers have said that they want. So we're going to, you know, keep pushing the envelope there more and more sensors. And that's that's kind of true to, you know, looks honest. We have, like I was saying, lots of different sensor varieties. We're adding event based this year. We're going to keep pushing the envelope on which ones that we want to pull in, and that kind of goes into the next one where sensor fusion is really important. So especially for the robotics companies, they want to have safe human detection. And safe human detection means they can't just solely rely on a neural net where one frame, it might mess a human or hallucinate. This is really important that we use both the classical computer vision approach on the stereo and then also, you know, adding in some of the new school stuff with the AI, the classics are classic for a reason, and so there's no reason to abandon on, you know, the classic computer vision that does a really good job at a lot of things. Okay? And
And then, you know, I won't dive too much into our roadmap, but we do like to just kind of highlight the kind of the four main things that we feel customers are always going to want and aren't really changing.

Okay? And
S Speaker 325:01Yeah. I mean, like, if open, AI just focused on, like, solving problems in law or lawyers, you know, like, we don't want to just kind of do one little narrow vertical that we're very across many verticals. Like the use cases that our customers come up with are wild, and we try to, we do our best to be able to support them. And yeah, I think we're getting the support that we need.
Yeah. I mean, like, if open, AI just focused on, like, solving problems in law or lawyers, you know, like, we don't want to just kind of do one little narrow vertical that we're very across many verticals.

S Speaker 125:25And talking about vertical Hunter, maybe you're going to cover in the next section, which is, you've shipped. You said you across 5000 customers. You've shipped 160,000 cameras. And then when did you so one is, when did you start shipping? Initially, the first cameras and, and since then, have you figured out across these 5000 customers, is there, like the top two or three verticals, where you see the highest amount of demand and and, and also from a product line perspective, how many products like SKUs do you have today? And then are there certain SKUs that are tailored to certain verticals? And if yes, then which one are those? And so I'm trying to understand the mapping of one, if then you have some verticals that are bigger than others, and then second, the how many skews? And then the mapping of skews to these top
And talking about vertical Hunter, maybe you're going to cover in the next section, which is, you've shipped. You said you across 5000 customers. You've shipped 160,000 cameras.

S Speaker 226:33Yeah, that's great, great questions I can cover off. So from a skews perspective, we do have around call it like 100 skews, but that's really a lot of child skews driven by variants of the product. So we really have basically, like made like eight main parent skews. You can actually basically see them in the diagram with here, over here, and then the like the products that that I showed up here. So this type of the product here, they might have like a dozen child skews, but as a parent, skewed gas about eight. And a product like this here, it's really popular with like, autonomous mobile robots. And so the area that we have the most traction with that using things like warehouse, warehousing, logistics, I'd say the vertical where we have the most traction is everything related to a vehicle, but not actually in the vehicle, but everything around the vehicle. So those are things like transportation AI, dash cams. They're things like cameras that do, like license plate recognition technology. They're like a recent order that we have with Bosch, which is to recalibrate their Adas systems. And some of the stuff around vehicles, too, is around like human, machine safety, things like that.
Yeah, that's great, great questions I can cover off. So from a skews perspective, we do have around call it like 100 skews, but that's really a lot of child skews driven by variants of the product.

S Speaker 227:52All technologies being an example there. So it's not actually a robot that moves, but it's something where it's monitoring something so some, in some cases, that's manufacturing, and other cases things like security. So

S Speaker 128:06the security camera, so your customer, so like Bosch is an example. Bosch makes their own cameras, green and China, of course, I'm guessing they're using the Chinese supply chain that are who are in high divisions of the world, and then in the US, you have, you know, Bosch access work harder Motorola and Mac vitellon And those companies. So do you work with like these OEMs that are making cameras?

S Speaker 228:41Those are like, for Boss. Boss recently just placed a $3 million order for this camera here, and they're using it for these Adas, recalibration systems that they sell to dealerships and repair shops in the United States and Europe. And that's just like, what does that mean?

Like, these are replacement cameras for Adas and cars. No,
Like, these are replacement cameras for Adas and cars. No,
Like, these are replacement cameras for Adas and cars. No,
S Speaker 229:05sorry. So the the ADAs systems, when there's a when a vehicle, say, has the windshield repair, or they get into an accident they have, or they're just doing a regular like factory checkup on the vehicle, they have to recalibrate the ADAs systems. And so our stereo cameras are used outside the vehicle as part of this kit. And then that kit that basically the technicians that take an Adas system that may have had some characteristics of the vehicle change or just need to be refreshed, that I got out of calibration over time, they use, they use our cameras to be able to recalibrate the

S Speaker 130:06and so. So going back, like, do you have maybe, let's talk about the business. And then from that, I can probably ask, which is, what's the largest chunk
and so. So going back, like, do you have maybe, let's talk about the business. And then from that, I can probably ask, which is, what's the largest chunk
and so. So going back, like, do you have maybe, let's talk about the business. And then from that, I can probably ask, which is, what's the largest chunk

30:15of the business today? Yeah, absolutely.
of the business today? Yeah, absolutely.
of the business today? Yeah, absolutely.
of the business today? Yeah, absolutely.
S Speaker 230:17Could you go to the next slide? I'm sure. So you can see these are the main revenue streams. So the bulk of our revenue today with hardware sales. So you can see, our hardware sales more than doubled in 2024 it's nearly 11,000,086% of that revenue is coming from repeat customers, and 90% of that sold direct. So we have a direct presence in the United States and Europe, where we hold inventory, we sell we sell these products direct to them from our shop and director of negotiated orders. We do have distributors located strategically around the world where we don't have a direct presence in particular places that are more lean into robotics automation, such as South Korea, Japan and China. So we work with local distributors there. And then we do have the kind of professional services that Hunter mentioned for and then the more nascent software subscription. So the way you see, can see our business at scale like by 2027, this is that, you know, basically service, the professional services part will generally be sunsetting, and then we'll have software subscriptions that will, you know, be driving by 2027, about 20% of our revenue, but you know, more than 30% of our gross margins, because it'll, it'll have a lot higher gross margins. The more hardware that people purchase, the more software subscriptions they'll need. And the more software they purchase, the more hardware that they need. So it's a nice, nice reinforcing

S Speaker 231:44So the software subscriptions are the first area that we have today is with our the fleet management layer. So the clients that are using that are using it to they have large quantities of our oaks, and they need to manage them remotely. And then they're also able to have proprietary applications that they manage and then can update regularly with it. So in some people

S Speaker 232:27So I use the example of we work with a customer in fish farming. So underwater, they use our cameras to detect the biomass of the fish. So when they sell the product to their customers, they have client facing application that gives them like analytics with the as the fish detections come so it says, Okay, here's a log of the fish. Here's how large they were on average. So it's basically like an application that overlays with the stream that they're getting from the fleet management layer.

S Speaker 232:56it yet to be launched, but we have some customers, just sort of some pilot internal customers today are using internally is more of an end to end AI model development tool, and the reason why we think this is important for Alexon, this is that the big challenge with AI models today is you can grab some model up the shelf and you have a hard time getting the right images into the training data set. That's going to make it be able to improve over time, like Hunter mentioned. So with our fleet management layer, you can set up something we call snaps, and so that's sort of like if the neural network confidence goes below, say, 70% then you can capture those images and you can get them right into the training data set. Or you just need to use an AI tool. Or we have an in house labeling team in Tunisia that can do it manually to then label the images where it's not working. So these are edge cases, the world's changing, what have you, and then you can then retrain the model that way. So ultimately, what the ecosystem enables is that it enables models that can recursively improve over time, rather than the K over time, because it has the you get the exact real world data that you're gathering to immediately retraining your model. So that's the tool name of AI. That's where we actually think that we'll be getting the most value, like the majority of the revenue that we'll be driving with the software subscriptions will be from that hub AI, which is yet to be launched, but it's something where we really want to be able to, with this capital raise, be able to go all in on it, because we think we have the unique value proposition of having the hardware, the fleet management, to be able to, you know, capture that real world data, like I mentioned.

S Speaker 134:33And then this $10.7 million in hardware revenue is equal to how many cameras.
And then this $10.7 million in hardware revenue is equal to how many cameras.
And then this $10.7 million in hardware revenue is equal to how many cameras.
And then this $10.7 million in hardware revenue is equal to how many cameras.

45 5000 is how many we sold in 24 45k
34:49unit, so and then so
S Speaker 134:53your ASP is around 250 bucks, exactly. Okay. And your margins on the hardware yes, if
your ASP is around 250 bucks, exactly. Okay. And your margins on the hardware yes, if
your ASP is around 250 bucks, exactly. Okay. And your margins on the hardware yes, if
your ASP is around 250 bucks, exactly. Okay. And your margins on the hardware yes, if
S Speaker 235:06you go to the next slide, so our gross margins today are at 40% and you can see the traction that we've got in our hardware sales. So this graph here shows the trailing six month hardware sales that we had. So it's gone from 2.2 million 15 months ago, 6.2 million today, okay, so and
you go to the next slide, so our gross margins today are at 40% and you can see the traction that we've got in our hardware sales. So this graph here shows the trailing six month hardware sales that we had. So it's gone from 2.2 million 15 months ago, 6.2 million today, okay, so and
you go to the next slide, so our gross margins today are at 40% and you can see the traction that we've got in our hardware sales. So this graph here shows the trailing six month hardware sales that we had. So it's gone from 2.2 million 15 months ago, 6.2 million today, okay, so and

S Speaker 135:31so that's 40% gross margin. And this is 40% is blended, I'm guessing. But the you know, the
so that's 40% gross margin. And this is 40% is blended, I'm guessing. But the you know, the
so that's 40% gross margin. And this is 40% is blended, I'm guessing. But the you know, the
so that's 40% gross margin. And this is 40% is blended, I'm guessing. But the you know, the
S Speaker 235:38majority of our sales today is with hardware. So the hardware gross margin is right around there, so it's like 38 39% okay, but we do, we do believe we have some pricing power, and we think as we, as we go to the series for lineup, we think that the hardware gross margin can trend to more like 45% and then, as we layer and software subscriptions, what this business looks like at scale from 2728 our overall gross margin can be about 50%
majority of our sales today is with hardware. So the hardware gross margin is right around there, so it's like 38 39% okay, but we do, we do believe we have some pricing power, and we think as we, as we go to the series for lineup, we think that the hardware gross margin can trend to more like 45% and then, as we layer and software subscriptions, what this business looks like at scale from 2728 our overall gross margin can be about 50%

S Speaker 136:09okay, and so you said, January, 25 6.2 million is that? So what's the Y axis? Y axis is revenue for that month sales,
okay, and so you said, January, 25 6.2 million is that? So what's the Y axis? Y axis is revenue for that month sales,
okay, and so you said, January, 25 6.2 million is that? So what's the Y axis? Y axis is revenue for that month sales,
okay, and so you said, January, 25 6.2 million is that? So what's the Y axis? Y axis is revenue for that month sales,
S Speaker 236:23yeah. So it means that as of January 2025, in the last six months, we did 6.2 million in hardware sales. Oh, last six months? Yeah. So I'm sorry it's a rolling, trailing, six months, trailing, six months, trailing, six months. Okay.
yeah. So it means that as of January 2025, in the last six months, we did 6.2 million in hardware sales. Oh, last six months? Yeah. So I'm sorry it's a rolling, trailing, six months, trailing, six months, trailing, six months. Okay.

36:45So, from a growth perspective, how do
So, from a growth perspective, how do
So, from a growth perspective, how do
So, from a growth perspective, how do
36:47you see the business growing from here?
you see the business growing from here?
you see the business growing from here?
you see the business growing from here?
S Speaker 136:51And the key, I think, is, are there?
And the key, I think, is, are there?
And the key, I think, is, are there?
And the key, I think, is, are there?
36:58Are there, you know, four or five big
Are there, you know, four or five big
Are there, you know, four or five big
Are there, you know, four or five big
S Speaker 137:04the question would be, you know, which is as companies scale. So, for example, let's say figure ends up doing 50,000 robots in three years. And if they get to a 50,000 units volume, will they continue to buy from you, or at that point, would they go with building in house or go with the Chinese supplier? Because in this market, as you imagine, like everybody is trying to squeeze the hardware phone costs and so, so everybody's trying to figure out, Where can I optimize further so which is, so when they get to a certain scale, which is, what's the size of your largest customer today, like, and then how big do you see some of these large
the question would be, you know, which is as companies scale. So, for example, let's say figure ends up doing 50,000 robots in three years.

Because in this market, as you imagine, like everybody is trying to squeeze the hardware phone costs and so, so everybody's trying to figure out, Where can I optimize further so which is, so when they get to a certain scale, which is, what's the size of your largest customer today, like, and then how big do you see some of these large

S Speaker 140:07Yeah, I agree. I'm just taking an example of, like, trying to figure out how, like this there's in this space, there's there's people who would require 100,000 cameras per year. But
Yeah, I agree. I'm just taking an example of, like, trying to figure out how, like this there's in this space, there's there's people who would require 100,000 cameras per year. But

S Speaker 140:39let's take an example, who's shipping? And it's not just stereo, right? You're also shipping binocular camera. So, so there's like,
let's take an example, who's shipping? And it's not just stereo, right? You're also shipping binocular camera. So, so there's like,
let's take an example, who's shipping? And it's not just stereo, right? You're also shipping binocular camera. So, so there's like,

S Speaker 243:51Yeah, so it depends, like the box order that we received earlier this year, all of it's being all of that $3 million order is being fulfilled by October. And then other cases, we receive orders that it takes us longer to fulfill. So sometimes we might get an order that takes us, you know, 1824 months to fulfill, depending on on their needs. Of the $22 million around things forecasting 25 I put that about kind of 16 million of that is kind of bacon. We'll say about 6 million that we're, you know, we're still working to close from our sales pipeline. Okay,
Yeah, so it depends, like the box order that we received earlier this year, all of it's being all of that $3 million order is being fulfilled by October.

S Speaker 144:26so, so you got fairly high confidence in doing 22 this year.
so, so you got fairly high confidence in doing 22 this year.
so, so you got fairly high confidence in doing 22 this year.
so, so you got fairly high confidence in doing 22 this year.
S Speaker 244:34Yeah. And, like I said, the 16 millions was picked in, you know, the 22 million it, you know, does require some things to go rack for pipeline, for sure, but we, you know, as we saw from that business, conversion rate continuing to increase. You know, we're confident we can, we can hit that. But, you know, as you know, with shipping hardware, sometimes we might get the orders we need for it, but they don't actually get delivered. They don't delivered by that so, you know, it could be some stuff that's late 25 pushes to 26 which could call cause it to be a bit short. But overall, from a pipeline perspective, we have a 320 $5 million sales pipeline. A lot of our promising opportunities in it.
Yeah.

S Speaker 145:47and and then there's predictability, if you get some big customers like who rely on, like, hundreds of 1000s of units, and I guess you're one step before that, which is fine. I might have to. I'll follow up with you and some questions that we will definitely have given our experience in similar businesses

S Speaker 246:35Yeah. On that front, we believe that we'll be able to be cash flow break even by the time that we get to the end of 27 so the fundraise basically gets us from from here to that to that point, which would be, you know, the about two and a half years time.
