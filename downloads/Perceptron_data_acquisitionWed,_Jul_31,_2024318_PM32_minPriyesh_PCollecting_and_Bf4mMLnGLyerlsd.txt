S Speaker 12:58like, this is a great question. So we literally have a spreadsheet with 50 different capabilities that we're targeting, and we will source data to nail down those 50 what those 50 capabilities. So it's anything from video, like question answering to content, moderation to even like measuring tasks, like the one that I really want to get is like, tell me the speed of the wind based off of how the leaves move? Or like, what is the distance between these two buildings given this video? Will this chair

S Speaker 13:33we essentially will, we'll go and we'll target these 50 capabilities at some distribution that we will figure out as we start training our models, because some tasks are just harder than other tasks. We will source the video data a from web scrapes or be from publicly available datasets, for example, segment anything just released 50,000 samples that we can use as a as a source. And, yeah, we will be using super annotates platform to do all the annotation, whether that's, you know, pointing annotation for audio, or pointing annotation in video segmentation, or if it's like, very coarse captioning are very coarse, you know, explanations of the environment, right? Yeah, essentially, yeah. Any modality and any piece of text out, we will support and

S Speaker 14:36Yeah, just just to clarify, this is for sourcing, so we source the videos, but we don't actually take the annotations. So for example, you can take like YouTube 1 million, find some videos from that data set that you really like and then do the annotation yourself. So it's primarily a sourcing exercise rather than using the data directly. I don't think we can use data directly. That being sent, there aren't datasets that we can buy, and we've slotted this in into our arrays, I think about half a million dollars is going into data acquisition. And so I always blank on the companies to find the Define AI. So they have like pre curated data sets, for example, for ASR, right, or

S Speaker 35:15they have some video annotation stuff as well. They have visual ASR speech classification, they have high curated, high quality data set and very specific niches that we can take from that as well.

S Speaker 15:28I would maybe say they're medium quality. So essentially, there's like, a low quality, low, relatively low quality, high quantity, which is the pre training, then there's data that we can buy or publicly available already annotated data, I would say this is like mid quality. And then for the really, really high quality, which is what's important for post training working two or more sourcing and curating errs.

S Speaker 25:50Okay. And then for the very high quality data, and then also not also understanding what exactly are you trying to annotate? You will have to work with customers who tell you how to do that, right? Yes, what to look for, what
Okay. And then for the very high quality data, and then also not also understanding what exactly are you trying to annotate? You will have to work with customers who tell you how to do that, right? Yes, what to look for, what

S Speaker 36:11to look for, I think is the is the main thing here. So the one the the part of the structure that we talked about earlier, as around the partnerships that we're building up for evaluation, the main thing is that the models that have gone through post training, and the full recipe like pre training, post training, the architecture, data sets, everything need to be aligned to what the evaluations provided by our partners. So that can influence every decision in the pipeline through like, what's the kind of posting data we need to collect? Maybe spatial reasoning is more or less important is what we're realizing through partnerships. They need to just influence the decisions across the board there. And then that changes how we do things whether any side of the problem there. Yeah,

S Speaker 16:50and it could even be like, you know, for example, like someone like skydio can come and say, hey, you know, like, actually, we've heard this quite a bit, but like, you're no models actually supporting aerial imagery, because people just don't pre trained on aerial imagery. This essentially means we have to go back and think about how we source how we do the data mixtures in order to get proper aerial imagery. Actually, there are very large scale, like scrapes of aerial imagery is just no one's using them. But but this is kind of the exercise that we have, when it comes to balancing out exactly what data sets we source. Well, we annotate. I think the way that we want to think about this is not that we're supporting a specific vertical domain, but that we're optimizing for a specific capability because capabilities are general, right? Domains are vertical. So for us, it's all about play of like, what capabilities, what can you what pre existing capabilities, can we do really, really well? And then what new capabilities? Can we add into the into this? First of all? That's good. And
and it could even be like, you know, for example, like someone like skydio can come and say, hey, you know, like, actually, we've heard this quite a bit, but like, you're no models actually supporting aerial imagery, because people just don't pre trained on aerial imagery.

S Speaker 27:52Have you have you, I'm guessing you've got you might have some thoughts around? Okay. So, you know, for these types of verticals, we might be targeting these partners for these types of verticals, we want to be targeting this, these partners, and these are these partners. It sounds like you've had some initial conversations, like you mentioned, where Carter, you've had some initial conversations with Ricardo? Or are you close to like contract with what we're caught up? Because the reason I'm asking is like, for each one of these verticals, are there some partners that you're targeting, and then would they be open to because, you know, most of these partners are worried about sharing their data,

S Speaker 38:31I can briefly start off on this one, I think there's a couple of things, just our decision matrix and how we decide the partners to do so what is the breadth, we do want one to two samples across each of the domains that we're looking at, to make sure it's a stratified sample of the market. The second is that we are very selective not just on the partners we have, but the teams we work with. For instance, we want the lowest operational overhead on us. But we still want to work to be useful for what's being built. So we're bouncing off the value of the partner themselves with the team that's there. The nice thing about the two that were the furthest along with, which is I think high physical intelligence. And then as you mentioned, ricotta as well, is that we're in talks with their AI team. So these are teams that have fine tuned models before they understand the importance of other foundation models and how to adapt them. So when ours comes in, they're more ready to take on this cost compared to folks that haven't done this. So these are the kinds of partners we're trying to like work through right now is working through not just their profile on their relevant to the market, but also how easy it'll be to work with given their background in AI. And then eventually, once we hit like more success, later stages of our model will bring will increase the breadth of the of the partnership that we have beyond just those folks. But this is how we're looking at the lowest operational overhead and the maximum velocity and maximum value.

S Speaker 19:48I guess your other point, we're just asking for evaluation data. So this is not a contentious point for anyone. This is literally like a couple dozen samples at the minimum. And again, no one's gonna complain

S Speaker 310:02No one has also complained about that, like it's been, it's been very smooth on that side. And it's like, because most people, when you enter a data sharing agreement are talking about, like 1000s of samples coming across all their devices and that kind of stuff. And now it's a big legal problem and this or that, but people showcase a dozen samples just as demos and such like that, too. So the fact that we're foundation model company, and we just need dozens to do evaluation has been a pretty, pretty nice sell to get like these things moving a lot faster than a traditional data sharing partnership would have taken, okay.

S Speaker 110:32And I guess one other thing that we've heard is pretty cool. It's like people will point to a very obscure public data set that we've never heard of, and they're like, this is the benchmark we use internally. So it's actually even like, like, we technically don't even need to sign the partnership agreement, because I can go and download the data. But it's like some obscure data set that we've never heard of that someone put out like five years ago. So that's like the other form of other former feedback that we've been getting with just like, very low coverage,

So that's like the other form of other former feedback that we've been getting with just like, very low coverage,
And I guess one other thing that we've heard is pretty cool. It's like people will point to a very obscure public data set that we've never heard of, and they're like, this is the benchmark we use internally. So it's actually even like, like, we technically don't even need to sign the partnership agreement, because I can go and download the data. But it's like some obscure data set that we've never heard of that someone put out like five years ago. So that's like the other form of other former feedback that we've been getting with just like, very low coverage,
S Speaker 210:57I think, see the other unlock that's happening now is what I'll tell you about computer vision. What we're seeing across the board, like there's companies that are able to build vertical computer vision company is just vertical comprehensive. So I'll give you an example of a company that does just gunshot detection. The company has actually done really, really well, they do just one thing. And one thing really, really well, there is going to talk detection. If you ask anybody in the US, including the head of Qualcomm's, you know, building security. I've asked him over the years. One question, what is one thing that keeps you up at night, it's essentially a gun shooter. And he would pay a good amount of money to a solution that could just detect gunshots, there was no solution that could do it with some of these foundation models, they're actually able to do it really, really well. The other one is, there's a company called panel AI, that does a wildfire detection. So detecting wildfires with cameras was a very, very hard problem, it still remains. So even for them, they don't use foundation models. So if you can detect wildfires with very high accuracy, you can actually build just a good reason by just detecting wildfires, because there's a difference between a cloud and a smoke. But it's not obvious. And it is it is difficult the samples that she's shown me a lot of times, I think, okay, I don't know. And then for the human heart, human eye, actually, after watching 10 seconds of video, it's still easy for computer vision, it's still not as easy. So because for the human eye, it has we were also relying on sense of smell somehow and but but it's not as easy for computer vision. So so there's companies in wedeco, computer vision use cases, these are use cases that were not solved before, it's the same thing. Like there was an example that Spotify was giving me of Michael's the, you know, the craft store chain, what they want is dumpster fire detection, that's a big deal for some reason. And they don't have a solution today to do like, and then these are things with existing cameras that they were just classifying objects. But what I'm saying is, you're not going to find these in data's public datasets. Some of these you will just find in customer datasets.
I think, see the other unlock that's happening now is what I'll tell you about computer vision.

S Speaker 313:31It's a fair point. But what we found out over time, is quite big. There's a lot of stuff that's in there. And there's a lot of stuff that also you get from composition. So like if I go and I look at a video of like a campfire, I start building up an idea of a fire and now I start looking at a video of a fireplace and I get a bigger idea of a fire. And I start looking at a video of a note barbecue grill and someone's grilling there and I get this idea of smoke behind it and such to. And the fact that we're going after everything very, very generally, these models hard to build up in turn, internally, essentially, these concepts of what these fires and such are, and where we would have thought like egocentric videos the example I give for this too, as we always thought you can get that from anywhere else who's recording egocentric video, it doesn't really happen maybe GoPro is doing and we were building custom solutions for all of like the Raybin meta series and like first party, wearables and such like that centered around egocentric video and such, but true using models trained on large scrapes of the internet just had the ability out of the box, despite not having a large amount of egocentric data involved and you can always improve on them further by adding in those that data. So, we have seen firsthand that these foundation models have trained appropriately, can pick up these concepts that like may have seen more niche may have seen more tale beforehand, just by doing this the proper way. So actually,
It's a fair point. But what we found out over time, is quite big. There's a lot of stuff that's in there. And there's a lot of stuff that also you get from composition.

So actually,
S Speaker 214:53is this also an emergent property, which is you don't I mean, you would would you call All this emergent property as well, which is you? Have you have it, or no, not really. It's

S Speaker 115:08emergent at some scale. I mean, to be honest, I think this is my gripe. A lot of people say they're training foundational models. But then, like if your foundational model cannot detect the dumpster fire by just asking, tell me if there's a dumpster fire. It's not a foundational model. I think foundation mode, by definition is a generalizable and disruptive capability. So I think this is emergent from the fact that you are training on an incredibly diverse set of data, like it truly is hard to grasp. Like how, how large the internet is, like any concept you can think of you will be able to find and if you're training on, like, you know, I think we're targeting like 15 trillion tokens, it's essentially going to cover almost every concept that's known to man. Same thing with like, GPT. Like, for all you can ask you the question about anything, right? And we'll know what like, it's even quite obscure things you won't know. And I think we're targeting the same thing. Actually, the beautiful thing that you mentioned is, like, we're trying to induce a phase change for these types of companies, where essentially, they become, like, I think people use this term negatively. I'm not sure but like, I'm not sure why, but like, chat, GPT wrapper, like, we want these companies to be like a perception perceptron wrapper for any of these tasks that you described, like dumpster fire should just be like, hey, just tell me if there's a dumpster fire, right? I shouldn't have to worry about going. I don't even know how you will collect that daily, would you go like that dumpster fire. You know, this

S Speaker 216:31though. Like I so so with these companies? So So you know, they pride themselves? On on? The moat? Is, is the model, right? So for somebody I like if I asked the CEO, he's like, no, no, no, no, that's not my mouth. Okay, but the the head of engineering at the same time, so I was like, Okay, you could work with people like this, right? So there's no problem because it's something else, you know? So, but the VP of engineering was like, you know, unknown, or he got a little it cuz he's like, okay, you know what, I trained this thing. So it's my baby. So people, you'll have to see, it won't be as easy as as convincing these guys as okay, you can become a perceptron rapper, like, like that panel AI company that I'm talking about? I mean, yeah, that's all that's there.

S Speaker 117:24And this is part of the reason why we're okay giving out normals, right? In a sense that we understand that you have some specific data that we don't have, and maybe with some instructable prompt, you get 90% there, but you want to get to 95%. Like we give you the model, you can continue training it, and you can deploy that. So you can maintain the whole stat that you have there.

S Speaker 117:52Essentially, we have a licensing strategy, right. So you essentially pay a license per model and the very similar way that mistral is doing it,

S Speaker 318:05Not not, and also fine tune their models and deployed on your stack. So Miss Shawn, I think record is the other one that'll send us this. And

S Speaker 218:20I'll tell you all my opinion on it.
S Speaker 218:40is hard. And then you know, you're here to replicate the city. It's not a replicatable sales motion either. It's not a replicatable product motion.
is hard. And then you know, you're here to replicate the city. It's not a replicatable sales motion either. It's not a replicatable product motion.

S Speaker 218:56those and we're miserable. We're literally going
S Speaker 419:00through that with Mistral and anthropic. And it's a fucking pain. Compared to some of the other companies where it's like, just use an APM. And stop talking to me anthropic is more like just use our API stop talking twice, and is trying to go through a sales motion for an unclear amount of revenue. And the second you distribute the model, all bets are off, man. There are some countries, some companies that will just do whatever.
through that with Mistral and anthropic. And it's a fucking pain. Compared to some of the other companies where it's like, just use an APM. And stop talking to me anthropic is more like just use our API stop talking twice, and is trying to go through a sales motion for an unclear amount of revenue.

S Speaker 119:30Yeah, so so we will have an API that we serve and you can pay the standard API price I think for the first release, we will do non commercial open week release. I think the the benefits for the market here or too big to skip on on this for folks that do want to have a commercial license. And there will be inbound traffic because we talk with like Polly Gemma folks, and the same thing happened with them. But it's a research lab. They don't they don't commercialize anything. We will essentially provide you the ability to use the open source models commercially. relicensed as a first step, I think from there as, as we see how the market progresses, likely, we'll start adding value added services. So for example, you can use a fine tuning service on top of our platform, and then ask for API based deployment. There are other folks where API based deployment doesn't work. So if you're doing like live stream content, moderation, there is no way in hell you would ever, like forward me your whole video stream, right? It's like, just the egress fees are, too. So in which case, you will kind of by definition, have to license out this model to run internally within your
Yeah, so so we will have an API that we serve and you can pay the standard API price I think for the first release, we will do non commercial open week release.

S Speaker 421:07no, he's saying in process, which means if I have the same YouTube, I have, there is no other way to deploy something on YouTube without without maybe YouTube was a bad example, Twitch, there's no other way to deploy

S Speaker 122:35And I think we have to be adaptable in general, I think I think the exact gonna market will be known once people are thinking, because for example, like a like, let's like axon, I think has a very different view of how these types of models need to work within their clusters, because they have some federal regulations, right. And I'm not sure like, we wouldn't necessarily want to get into this worrying about federal regulations if they want like an API service. But in general, I think there's a wide spectrum of deployment. And I think we just have to be adaptive in the way that we react to what the market wants, licensing with, like the least operationally expensive thing for us to do. Because we're a small team that's primarily focusing on building out the best model, and the first year, but I think even even on our

S Speaker 423:17board we're arguing is, it's actually the most operationally expensive way to distribute your software. I've been through this process, because you gotta get procurement and lawyers and blah, blah, blah. And your process of actually getting somebody to sign a deal is, is and getting them to integrate it, it will get frustrated to the point where it'd be like, just give me access to your code, I will fucking integrate this. And it'll be faster than this. It's literally going to be like that. Because you're used to a certain level of competence at Facebook, the world is not like that.

S Speaker 323:54It's a very fair point. Just to summarize, the respective are said, I think the main thing is that perception, one goes after large scale market release, get everyone excited about it. Openweight noncommercial get the academics involved to get anyone building a prototype demo anywhere, along with Cloud API available at launch as well. Like you can just carry it through cloud as well. From there, we'll see how folks react to it and what is like becoming more and more prevalent here, as we drive that market expansion. And if it means we don't do licensing is something we'll talk about if it means something, we're like more fine tuning and added services, something we'll talk about too, if it means like world.

S Speaker 126:11Um, I think we're good. So update wise yesterday was I think the last meeting we had one on one with with the VC. So we're essentially getting independent offers. I think yesterday was the last day. I think this week off, Shawn and I are just going to have some soul searching to figure out, you know, what the actual Syndicate is going to look like. We'll be in the bay on Thursday to talk with, I guess, the part of their vote. Yeah, partner with on Thursday. I think by the end of this week, or I guess by Monday at the latest, we should have some intuition about what the round structure will look like in terms of who we want as lead co lead.
