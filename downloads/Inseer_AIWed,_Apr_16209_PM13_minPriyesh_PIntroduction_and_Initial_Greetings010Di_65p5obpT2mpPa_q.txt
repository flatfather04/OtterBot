S Speaker 20:36yes, yes. I love that. I did come across your demo as well, I remember and shame. So just full candle here, I think from an investment perspective, you might be around early for us, but computer division is a very big focus area for us. So I wanted to just meet you, develop a relationship, maybe down the line, we see some partnership opportunities with Qualcomm. We do that quite a lot, with a lot of startups now, and build a relationship and relation towards the next round. So that's what I'm focusing on. We have done some seed rounds. So optimistically, sometimes we do seed but it seems like, given the stage of the company, might be around early for

S Speaker 41:06us. Yeah, I've spent a good amount of time figuring out, how can I figure out a way to pitch this to you? And it makes sense for you at this stage. So I think we're both in the same view. And so I think my takeaway was, find a way to leverage this for additional introductions that you might have that would be interested in our technology. And look, it's maybe, if I just, what I would do is focus on, you know, the one page. And let me just, where is that slide show? Is you're right, we're early, but we're about to eclipse the $1 million revenue, right? And so, you know, I guess the first question would be, and this is zoom. So sorry, this is a little more complex than, you know, we the good news is we make really, really good progress in the last 60 to 90 days where we finally had what was in place for that. Customers were like, you know, the aha moment, right? And so Ford has now been introducing us to GM, and still honest, Liberty Mutual has been making introductions. So the point is, is that we're, you know, I think we're gonna go through this, this one got 1.3 million in visibility, already in revenue. We're putting these pretty good logos up there. And so, you know, I thought maybe I would just show you a two minute demo, and because you didn't get the chance to see that. And can you, does it show? Does it say analytics? Yeah. So again, what do we do? We convert body movement to math, right? And then we use that math to tell stories. And so, you know, somebody literally is going to at the end of the day. What we try to do ergonomics. We're trying to prevent musculoskeletal injuries. The first thing you do is you see that color coding skeleton overlay. The reason it's turning colors is it's looking at thresholds. It's looking at math and saying, Okay, you exited a 45 degree threshold. I'm going to turn the background. So background. And so when we come down to our waveforms in real time, we look at this and say, okay, 56% of the time we're exceeding that 45 degree threshold, right? And so we're looking at the other body joints, and none of these are in red, either on skeleton overlay. And so we know that those aren't the biggest challenges. Then it's how you tell the story with that math. And we use things like a NIOSH lifting equation. And we there's a number of lifts that you see in that video. We rank those, those those lifts, and then you can actually come in and start doing root cause analysis. And this one, it's the recommended weight limit is 17 pounds when you're lifting something that's 42 pounds. An ergonomist who's trained in this will, they're going to focus on this stuff down here. We make it super simple to say 51% of the reason you have challenges due to that horizontal pan location. So they're going to look at that, oh, 17.3 inches versus 1.4 I know that that's given the weight we're lifting. And then they would say, Okay, well, what is the solution? Come down to our solutions. They start clicking on this, and first thing is, raise it 35 to 37 inches, right? You might come back and click on this one and say, okay, at the origin, indoor destination, maybe when you want to adjust. So that's the two. I mean, there's tons of stuff in here, but that's it. In a nutshell. The reality is trying to do is, once you now have done a bunch of assessments, we can drill it in through hierarchies and start to say, Okay, let's go focus on these 10 people at this location, right? That's the goal. This

S Speaker 23:56is very interesting. Can you tell me a little bit more about the models that you're using? How did you go about developing that? What's the background architecture behind them? And what kind of proprietary data sets did you use? Just top level, I understand, you don't want to disclose the secret sauce, but how do you are you also thinking about sort of consolidating data more over and over again as you get more enterprise on board? Yeah.

S Speaker 44:15So this, we have our own motion capture facility, so using a Python camera set. And so think of that as 12 cameras in a room dressing somebody up in dots and creating those data sets, annotating those data sets, frankly, that's what was in the early years. And so training those models to recognize and get the stability of that skeleton overlay, because it's that's, again, we actually show customers that raw data so they can self validate everything, right? And so what you see is a yellow box. You see, there is some open pose things of that nature, but it's really the time that's spent on those data sets to make them, frankly, best in class. Velocity. We're taking customers away from both. And it's really comes down to the accuracy and

S Speaker 44:57I guess I you'd have to get pitched. But chimaki is backed by Intel Capital. Confidentially. Intel is talking to us. It's odd. It's like, just give you a heads up. Your Intel capital is invested in our competitor. You want to talk to us? And then velocity, EHS is the other one that's owned by private equity. And it's kind of like setting up shop to a poor competitor. It's private equity owned, and they're not. Their attention is not on what we do. We've got some very big clients in the pipeline that we're taking away from them. We just Google they coming away from velocity just so just as an example, here's the real juice is we got to take the rest of the year to finish building out the tools on this. Liberty Mutual's already asked us to go to a continuous area, which is substance involved. So think of that as the always on. We on cameras, secure cameras that we compete against, protest voxel and tensi, but they're willing to sell it for us. We just got to make it a cheaper version of what they've got on the front end side Ford and GM, they're sitting there going, you have all of our data. You have the actual guy on the line that's pulling the wire on us through the door. We do that work in process, the Siemens process simulator, Siemens Jack and not realistic. We need your data create the digital twin up front and then selling this to the engineering group, where we've got the actual data used. And so there's, again, that's these are two contiguous areas to what we do today. It's going to take us a while. We've got to focus on what we're doing. But that's where some of the real juices were, frankly, the Trojan force into these large companies that are asking us to do other things with it. Yeah,

S Speaker 46:34So secret has I've got a video of the guy doing something on their floor. I take those exact measurements of that person and create a digital twin, and then, as they are recreating their new f1 50 line, they've got all the real measurements today. The way they do that, they do that in process, simulate with a mannequin, effectively. And so we can do that with real data versus simulated data. Very

And with the simplicity of taking a video from iPhone, we can be substantially more accurate if we were to use stereo cameras or something else. But again, you've got to have something that is easy to use for the customer. Literally, they take their iPhone in, and you have to take a video eight to 10 feet away, capture the whole person, right? What we the math that we're doing, you cannot capture from security, right? That, think of that as more general object detection. There's actually a search between that and what we do, because that general object detection can give you a red light. Hey, go look at this.

S Speaker 27:41And so if that's the case for enterprises, is it typically a barrier for them to have someone or person using machinery, equipments on a phone camera, rather than having it in a fixed CCD somewhere? Sorry, is it an independent certificate? Is it a barrier for them in terms of adoption, because you have to have someone recording the video all the time using a mobile

So the big logos that you see there enterprise customers, 125,000 they don't all land at 125,000 sometimes they start small, and then, and then they they add on top. So it's based both a user and usage based model, and then we are eventually going to be layering in a good, better, best model as well.

So definitely around earlier for us, I would say, in terms of where we like to play, and we have to include a lot of compliance and legal teams internally. So a small merchant does not really move the needle for us. But where I can see synergies here is that we often work with several computer vision companies. It's a big focus area for us, because you can imagine a lot of our chip sets. We profitably sell chips which are more than a billion dollars, billion cameras a year across all mobile devices. So it's computer vision for us. We have good investments in the space as well. And we very regularly partner with some companies, introduce them to enterprises. It could be automobile OEM mobile OEMs, PC OEMs, the likes of Pepsi that we work closely with for commercial partnerships. I'm happy to have do that with you.
