S Speaker 21:48Nice and and how long have you been with Qualcomm for then, two and a half years at Qualcomm, yeah. Then, prior to Qualcomm, I worked for an E commerce company called wix.com Yes, they are Israeli company, so I take started their DevRel team. And prior to that, I worked at Microsoft. That led me to the US. Worked in Microsoft in India, and then worked for Microsoft in the US, in developer and startup relations in the US, and then in bunch of engineering roles back in back in India. Very interesting. Prashant, that's amazing. Well, good to meet you. Absolutely. Very pleasure meeting you. And I would say, for the first year, a lot of my job responsibility has been meeting a lot of startups on the ecosystem, getting them back and pitching, like getting them to pitch to Qualcomm ventures. So I'm focusing quite a lot on the top of the funnel, if you would, for the sourcing part of things, and I guess in that aspect, down the line, would have a lot of collaboration opportunities with you. So great to meet you. Yeah. So I think I'll tell you, I'll explain to you what our charter is, and that probably will give you a sense of how to narrow it down. And I've been explaining this to Sergio as well, and he and I, we have been, we have had a few conversations so you.

S Speaker 24:09To think of if you meet companies, I'll give an example. There's a there is a startup called Neo, for j i don't know if you have heard of them. I'll type it here. So look,

S Speaker 26:34Campaigns that we run. So that's essentially our job. So I think in the vein of, in sort of following up to our connection, we are hosting our first tavril ai summit on the 23rd of September. So in that we we are bringing partners like Neo 4j or box in 51 or on the on the on the larger size of partners. We are bringing in the Microsoft and the matters of the world. But on the younger side of it, we are bringing companies like there is a company called maps, act napsack, essentially, do they run an offline agent that interacts with your own

7:26think both training and influencing. want to keep it exclusive, both for the external and the internal audience, but i still want handful of qualcomm teams to be represented as an example. i am going to have the head of ai software will join us. we are also going to get, we would love to get as an example, you as the Qualcomm manager still represented for the event. So you know we are picking up teams that these partners can find relevance and. And then for, especially for. buffer hardware themselves and don't network. Yeah, yeah. the stream. so i think companies and growth stage have more to lose, and then also, they also gaining ground, meaning they are growing. they have a certain revenue stream, but they also have captive developers that they are working with. so the advantage of growth stages, it's not a question where, oh, i'm still building this feature, or i have this engineer who has a day job, but he he doubles up as a DevRel advocate in the evening, goes for meetups that becomes sort of so if we. of our hardware, but your experience is building things on raspberry pi or ad reno. and the question is, it's such a disconnect because our hardware is far more complex to work on, and that's why when you bring people like model servers or rag data implementers, when you bring such people who make it easy for a developer to write application on a. City of working on, Qualcomm, but it gives you all the upside of the hardware capability through this server model provider. In many cases, they'll give it to you for free, because they want distribution, and certain services come at you know, in a premium model. But then, even even. And their prospects. So they are interested, mildly interested, or interested, but still sitting on the fence. Maybe you can invite them for an event like this, where they're like, hey, learn from our executives of what we are doing at this stage is going to be a it's going to be a standing room, because all seats are full in terms of partners, but we can always accommodate. You. Can also throw in a few extra chairs. They can figure it out. So if you have such people who are credible, both from within the and their prospects so they are interested, mily interested or interested but still sitting on the fence, maybe you can invite them for an event like this where they are like hey, learn from our executives of what we are. what was that country? Lambda test met with this week. So lambda test also cool. Well, welcome aboard. You're still under the year. You can continue to play the newbie card for a long time to come. Keep using it. I still use it, even after being here two and a half years. Thanks. Look forward to seeing you again. Will you be there in person for the meetup, though? Yes, okay, I'll see you in the summit. Yes, the summit. Okay, I'll see you. Then there. Cool. We have the invite. I probably can extend the invite to it. There is an internal invite that has gone out to people who are interested. I don't actually have it. I don't think I have any more internal team members. I'll forward it to you. Okay, perfect. Thanks. Cool. Appreciate your time. Bye. It at this stage is going to be a it's going to be a standing room because all seats are full in terms of partners, but we can always accommodate. You. Can also throw in a few extra chairs. They can figure it out. So if you have such people who are credible, both from within the both within the portfolio and, more importantly, outside the portfolio that you want to create some value for bring them on. So I think the best thing would be, I was sending this to Sergio as well. Take me the names beforehand, before you invite them. Yeah, let's have a conversation around. Or, you know, not even have to have a conversation. We can do an offline I can look up and see I can check with the team, and if they feel like the right partner, make an intro, build the potential that hey, there is DevRel. DevRel is hosting an AI Summit. Would you be interested? And if they are, instead of extending an invite, we can always jump on a call, learn more about them, what they like we did with what was that company, lambda test we had with this week so lambda test is invited. Awesome. Cool, well welcome aboard. You're still under a year you can continue to play the newb card for a long time to come to keep using it as soon as, even after being here to announce. Thanks.
