S Speaker 11:14in venture? Oh, absolutely sure. So I'm only from India. Did my undergrad there and work with a lot of early stage startups. Back in that time, I was quite interested in entrepreneurship. Work for a clean tech firm from its series A to currently they're filing for an IPO. So that was a great experience, but always realized that I enjoy working with a lot of startups at once, and probably don't have the right passion to sort of jump in, hold myself down to one idea, and then start something of my own at that moment. So I wanted to pivot into venture, and then went to the States, did my MBA at UCLA, worked with a lot of funds during that time. Morpheus was an LA based fund. I spent an year with and then about half a year with Menlo Ventures in Bay Area. And then I've been with the call and been with Qualcomm ventures team focusing on AI investments for the last year or so. Work here as a senior associate. And then a brief, quick background about the fund. We have, we had a corporate venture arm of Qualcomm, been around for about 25 years or so. We have deployed more than $2.5 billion in capital. Have currently probably around 250 plus active investments. It's a global fund. So we have offices in us, Latin America, Israel, China, India, UK, to name a few spaces. And then, apart from AI. AI is going to be a very big focus for us in the coming years. But apart from Ai, we also look at industrial automation, IoT, robotics, ar, VR, automobile tech stack, or broadly, if you see anything which has a degree of compute or connectivity built into it. That's, that's the space we play in, preferably a series, a plus investor in seed. We have started in, sorry, in AI, we have started doing seed, given the valuation. And then check sizes would be two to 10 million preferably sweet spot somewhere between five to 10.

S Speaker 23:23Okay, so you guys are definitely on the on the later stage, later side, which is good because, you know, we invest time more in the early side. So if something's, you know, too late for us, and we can send that over. So we typically do 200 to 800 paycheck sizes. And you'd invest like the pre seed and seed stages companies that are so we specifically invest in immigrant founders to the US. So first generation and sector agnostic within tech, and we're pretty, like, flexible in terms of like, like I said, with an industry just know, like biotech pharmaceuticals, cryptocurrency or medical devices,

S Speaker 13:59very interesting. So immigrant founders, personally, I do see a lot of Indian founders probably doing their masters or research here in us, and then going on to start a lot of companies. So that's, that's a space, or that's a community I'm very well connected to. Maybe would be interesting to you, if, if I come across a few of those founders, would love to send them across? Yeah,
very interesting. So immigrant founders, personally, I do see a lot of Indian founders probably doing their masters or research here in us, and then going on to start a lot of companies.

S Speaker 24:20yeah. That would be great. And I think the key thing is that, yeah. So based in the US, they Delaware, C Corp, obviously, and then also the key market should be the US as well. So that's that point that I think isn't, isn't common a lot of firms, but we just like the market to be the US,
yeah. That would be great. And I think the key thing is that, yeah. So based in the US, they Delaware, C Corp, obviously, and then also the key market should be the US as well. So that's that point that I think isn't, isn't common a lot of firms, but we just like the market to be the US,

S Speaker 14:41understood, Sarah, what's keeping you busy now is there, are there any specific focus areas that you looking at more in detail? Yeah,

understood, Sarah, what's keeping you busy now is there, are there any specific focus areas that you looking at more in detail? Yeah,
S Speaker 24:50good question. So although we're, you know, we're sector agnostic, areas that we're specifically excited about, like right now. So we really like robotics, SaaS, like AI and marketplaces like, broadly speaking, also AI agents is, like, really interesting to us, me personally. So like, this is not actually, not like a specific focus of the firm. I mean, we do invest in it, but like me, personally deals that I know very well and get excited about, like, prop tech, because I've worked in real estate previously, creator economy, because I create content on LinkedIn, and I also know a lot about the space, also, just like AI in general, because I worked at AI specific VC fund previously, I'm not, I'm not a tech person by nature, so there are still things I'm learning. But yeah, that is, that is a space in general. I think to be very clear that when I say AI, what that means, because that is very broad. I mean a company that has a really strong so it doesn't necessarily have mean, if a company is like an AI specific company, whether they're they're developing like tools to prevent like hallucinations, that's like really interesting companies that are kind of making like predictions. I think what I mean by this is Crunch base recently, and I went to this today, they unveil, unveiled, the launch of their new, like predictive engine, where they can actually predict if a startup is going to raise like that, to me, is really cool. So like companies that can actually make predictions using AI, yeah, I think also more specifically, like if a company is not like an AI focused company, but having an AI strategy. So a tech company that has a really strong AI component to it, right? That's really interesting. So hopefully it adds a little bit more context.
good question. So although we're, you know, we're sector agnostic, areas that we're specifically excited about, like right now.

S Speaker 26:39that, yeah, that's, that's good to know. And so you guys, you guys invest like two to 10 million. So I think you said to series a seed,
that, yeah, that's, that's good to know. And so you guys, you guys invest like two to 10 million. So I think you said to series a seed,
that, yeah, that's, that's good to know. And so you guys, you guys invest like two to 10 million. So I think you said to series a seed,
that, yeah, that's, that's good to know. And so you guys, you guys invest like two to 10 million. So I think you said to series a seed,
S Speaker 16:47to series a seed wouldn't be really a strategic focus for us. We do it more opportunistically for some investments where we want to come in early, and we may sort of have a strategic value to add, but mostly we have done seed only for a few companies so far, and only when we sort of see that the valuations would be hugely increased if they come, if they launch a product in the next round, or if any other financial tier one VC joints in so it's more opportunistic in nature. But some of these seed, seed rounds, which are larger in size, is probably around ten million or or above that, that that's a space that I think we we can still carve out enough of a check size for us to make sense. Okay,

S Speaker 17:43not as such. We are valuation specific. But even that, we are very stage agnostic. I would say we don't have a valuation target, ownership target. Again, varies quite a lot, given we take a look at a lot of different companies, many of them have are, I would say, capex intensive. We have, we have made investments in some of the foundation model company being one of them. So valuation and ownership targets not really as much for us. I would say we don't tend to take board seats. We would prefer to take a board observer seat. So that's, that's like, a decision factor, sometimes for us, and then we sort of perspective that down the line is there a value add from Qualcomm, given that we can either act as a customer for the company, we can act as a go to market partner, or if it's a if the company could use some of Our compute plays across different platforms, PCs, mobile, cloud compute, which is a new offering we have, so we evaluate it from some of those strategic lenses as well.

So that's, that's like, a decision factor, sometimes for us, and then we sort of perspective that down the line is there a value add from Qualcomm, given that we can either act as a customer for the company, we can act as a go to market partner, or if it's a if the company could use some of Our compute plays across different platforms, PCs, mobile, cloud compute, which is a new offering we have, so we evaluate it from some of those strategic lenses as well.
S Speaker 28:48Okay, makes sense. And what do you specifically like like to see in founders, like any specific like founder characteristics.
Okay, makes sense. And what do you specifically like like to see in founders, like any specific like founder characteristics.

Okay, makes sense. And what do you specifically like like to see in founders, like any specific like founder characteristics.
S Speaker 18:55So we are a deep tech firm, and given that the entire team. Apart from me, I come from an MBA background. But other than me, the entire team has a very deep we do prefer to see a technical founding team, some folks, if it's a vertical startup, some folks who have been in those industries in the past, and then a lot of these deals come in from reference. So we prefer to sort of have validations from some people we already know about those founders

S Speaker 29:25makes sense. And I guess more specifically, like on the technical founding team, like just meaning that they've built something in that, like industry before, or more just technical, like in nature.

S Speaker 19:36So I would say repeat founders are always, always a plus, not a deciding factor again. But yes, if your founder has built something in that specific area, that's that's a big plus. If we if, let's say it's an AI investment. We prefer people coming in from the big tech companies who have already worked in some of their AI research arm made a few investments in those kind of founders in the last year, so that's been that we sort of look for, but I wouldn't say any of these are very deciding factors for us. We are flexible in that matter, and kind of try to see if, overall, it does make sense, and if some of the risks for that specific investment could be mitigated by the founders background, if, overall, the story adds up. It makes sense.

S Speaker 210:26Makes sense. Sounds good. And then I guess another, another thing I'm curious about is like, you know, kind of flipping it back over to you, is what, like, what areas I guess, right now, specifically, are you focused on? Like, I guess, do you have a specific focus within your firm, or does everyone kind of focus on the same, the same areas that the firm?

S Speaker 110:45So some people in the firm, we have specific focus areas, like we have someone looking at AR VR investments. We have someone particularly focusing on supply chain, someone on dev tools, I personally and would be for the next half of the year, focused on AI invest. AI agent investments. We have made a bunch of investments in the infrastructure, hugging phase, anthropic scale, AI, weights and biases. So infrastructure and tooling, it seems like we have good bets in there. We haven't made a lot of investments in agents so far. So we're looking at personally, me and the managing director who also leads our AI investment strategy, along with one more person in the team. So looking at horizontal framework screw AI RC, few of these, looking at some vertical AI agents as well, but not really very industry specific. In that matter, we wouldn't do FinTech or healthcare. But other than that,

S Speaker 211:48Okay, sounds good. So, like when you say so, not like FinTech or healthcare in with an AI agents, right? Yes, okay, makes sense. And then, okay, yeah, so sounds good. And then, yeah. So I guess other other things for us, so I don't yet, but like, we do any work with pre revenue up to 1.5 million in error. So we're pretty flexible. Do you guys have, especially, like, revenue targets?
Okay, sounds good. So, like when you say so, not like FinTech or healthcare in with an AI agents, right? Yes, okay, makes sense. And then, okay, yeah, so sounds good. And then, yeah.

S Speaker 112:15Not really. We again, if it's pre product, most of the times it does not work. So for us, and then we wait for our own. But rule of thumb, if they have crossed a million dollar in error, that sort of makes it the right fit at that time. Not really a target, but that's like a rule of thumb we use,

S Speaker 112:51Would you have my email? I'd love to sort of post this call, maybe send a brief background about the fund, and then we can always rediscuss on email. I'm also quite open to chatting on WhatsApp, if that works for you. So both of them would be okay with me LinkedIn. Sometimes I I'm not as caught up on LinkedIn, so that probably isn't the best way to communicate.

S Speaker 213:15Makes sense? Yeah, let's, let's do, let's do email, because I know that it's sometimes easier to kind of, like, track everything, because I do have WhatsApp, but the challenge is that I'm in a lot of, like, a lot of like, WhatsApp groups. Yeah, sometimes I miss messages, and I feel like there's, I know, there's got to be some better way of, like, you know, monitoring that and like, you know, just maybe putting things on mute. But for whatever reason, I've just had a lot of issues with WhatsApp, and I'm not sure why.

S Speaker 113:41Absolutely. Sarah, I get that. So a couple of quick questions, do you lead rounds at the stage that you come in? Do you lead rounds? And what level of partnership? What level of partnership do you get in with your portfolio companies?
Absolutely. Sarah, I get that. So a couple of quick questions, do you lead rounds at the stage that you come in? Do you lead rounds? And what level of partnership? What level of partnership do you get in with your portfolio companies?

S Speaker 213:54Yeah, so we, that's a good question. I forgot to mention that. So we don't lead price rounds, but we can kick smart, safe rounds. Now that being said, if we're doing like a follow on investment in an existing portfolio, portfolio, portfolio company, we can lead. So we recently led the series of one of our portfolio companies. And so we did, we did, you know that was, that was like a lead. And so that's a company that we've invested a lot into. And then you asked about ownership, yeah,
Yeah, so we, that's a good question. I forgot to mention that. So we don't lead price rounds, but we can kick smart, safe rounds. Now that being said, if we're doing like a follow on investment in an existing portfolio, portfolio, portfolio company, we can lead. So we recently led the series of one of our portfolio companies.

S Speaker 114:26not really ownership, but maybe, like another question on that area, I think your answer clears things out on in my mind. But what level of partnership sort of you go in with some of your companies? Do you take more board seats? Do you sort of work with them in any specific areas in development cycle?
not really ownership, but maybe, like another question on that area, I think your answer clears things out on in my mind. But what level of partnership sort of you go in with some of your companies?

Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
S Speaker 116:39Got it, got it. And would you do? Would you invest in a pre product company, just at the idea stage, and pay back the founders? I come across a lot of those companies, so just curious to

S Speaker 216:50know, yes, we would, but Yes we would. What I will say, though, is, like, they'd have to be exceptional founders, obviously. I mean, like, you know, like, like, good market, something innovative, yeah, like, we're very open to investing quite early. I know we've done that in several cases. I don't remember the companies that the specific companies, because that was like before I joined, but I know that we have done that, and I think that the key there is that we aren't so even though we're not valuation sensitive, if it's a lot newer company, generally speaking, we'd want a lower valuation. However, if it is, like, an exceptional founder, and they've, like, you know, had past exits, like, or if they're a unicorn founder, like, obviously, you know, like, they're gonna have a higher valuation, that's fine. Like, I know some companies we've looked at, they've had unicorn founders and like, they're just gonna have higher valuation. So in that case, that's fine. But I think just generally speaking, like, they would just have to have a lower valuation. Because I think, and I guess this is another question to you, is, like, I'm curious what valuations you're kind of seeing right now in SF, because I know even here, I'm seeing pretty high valuations for companies that don't have a lot of traction, and the founders are, like, really good, but they're not like, founders,
know, yes, we would, but Yes we would. What I will say, though, is, like, they'd have to be exceptional founders, obviously.

S Speaker 117:58yeah, I agree. It's kind of everywhere. So a few companies raising at probably 60x to 100x of their revenue multiples is something that I'm seeing very often. Now, for a lot of these companies, they have developer traction as well, but that does not really translate into revenues, and still, a lot of these companies are raising based on multiples, on those traction that they have. So interestingly, quite high valuations. I guess seed rounds are somewhere between 50 to 100. Series A goes from 300 to 500 for some of these hot AI companies in the market. So it's crazy, but yeah, everyone has to play in the market.
yeah, I agree. It's kind of everywhere. So a few companies raising at probably 60x to 100x of their revenue multiples is something that I'm seeing very often.

S Speaker 218:43Yeah, no, that actually is really crazy, because I feel like, like, and do you think it's still the case where, I mean, this is might be kind of like an obvious question, but like, where you're seeing right now, even though valuations are increasing, it's still like SF is a lot higher than other other geographies. Oh,
Yeah, no, that actually is really crazy, because I feel like, like, and do you think it's still the case where, I mean, this is might be kind of like an obvious question, but like, where you're seeing right now, even though valuations are increasing, it's still like SF is a lot higher than other other geographies.

Oh,
S Speaker 118:59could be, could be, but for AI, I don't like if I'm just comparing it across US, I don't see specifically for AI companies, regional specific valuation approach. I would say I've spoken to a few New York based companies, and I don't think their valuations were any cheaper. So I wouldn't particularly say so a lot of it is that there is a lot of capital to deploy in AI, and that's why most of this is getting very highly valued. Something that we have been doing quite a lot internally is sort of mapping, if we are doing an early stage investment in AI sort of mapping, if they have a good path to raise an extra at a much higher valuation. And that these, a lot of these things for us, and we, for a lot of these companies, we see that if a tier one investor joins, and if the founder has a credible background, if their product, the day they launch the product, they enter into some sort of plg led virality, the next round would be at much higher valuation. So that sort of gives us a little bit comfort around taking that risk for a higher valuation.

S Speaker 220:09Okay, makes sense, yeah? Because I think, like, one thing too that we've also been seeing is we'll see some companies that are raising it what seems to be a super high valuation, but then, like, maybe within like, six months to a year, they'll raise another round and double that, which is really great, but it's because there's something really exciting. And so that's also why, you know, as much as we say, oh, like, we don't want a high valuation, it's like, also, like, you know, sometimes there's a case where it makes sense and the company's actually going to end up doing very, very well. So I think it's like, it's interesting, because sometimes, like, I'll maybe tell founders or teller VCs that, like, this is what we want. Sometimes it seems like what we're saying is contradictory, but it's more just thought. When you're making it, there's always exceptions. And so I think that's kind of the case where it's like, it's sometimes tough to say this is exactly what we want, because there's always going to be
