We are looking to invest in this current round that they're raising, and as as part of that, we were doing some customer diligence. And then I wanted one example from George with a customer where, who has seen both deployments was in the Ozzy. He calls it the previous version, with Ethernet cable,

S Speaker 33:39I've had different roles with the company. I've been the chief operating officer for the last going on 10 years. It'll be 10 years in April. But prior to that, I was in finance, accounting. I ran a building for a couple years. I did acquisitions for eight years, you know, finding new markets to expand into, and finding the sites, negotiating purchase and working with our development team on the titles. So that's a little bit about about me and the company history we are in our space, where we're an acuity provider, in the sense that the majority of our residents have needs care needs. About a quarter of our residents live in a secured memory care area of the building, so roughly 1000 out of the 4000 that live with us,

S Speaker 34:46there's another 1000 or so that have early stages of memory loss MCI, but they're able to live and function in assisted living, but we do that through a very structured program that we have that's called our friends program, where it's a very structured day, very structured programming, and it's really intended for a resident that's somewhere between, you know, your typical assisted living. And they don't really need to be in a secure environment, but they need something more so. So then with that, you have higher care needs, more acuity, and

S Speaker 35:55We, we don't have independent living in all of our buildings just a handful, maybe 25% of the buildings have independent living, but we license those units the same way we do assisted living, so that our residents can age in place and not have to move. And often our independent units are ideal for a couple, because each spouse ages differently. One may have memory loss. One may have high care needs, you know, where the other one is still more independent. So we're able to accommodate a couple like that, or

a business, so also from that standpoint, yeah. So
a business, so also from that standpoint, yeah. So
a business, so also from that standpoint, yeah. So
S Speaker 37:33we mean, let's, let me first talk about the memory care. So we have in almost all of our memory care units. I think we have four communities where we don't have safely U we're adding the cameras in 25 to that to one of the one of the four, and it's really just a cost issue that they're the lowest margin buildings for us, and we just didn't want to absorb more cost. But we we don't charge an extra fee for safely you. We just kind of build it into our rental rate. And the reason we took that approach with secured memory care is because we saw the value of knowing what's really happening with the customer when they fall, and so we didn't want there to be a barrier with the customer and us saying, you know, we have the safely you product. It's, you know, we'll detect falls. Here are the benefits. And, oh, by the way, it's going to cost you another $300 a month and have the customer say, No, we don't want to pay anymore. So for secured memory care, we just made the business decision early on, that it's just part of the rent. And the benefits that we see is, you know, knowing what happened to that resident, because you can't rely on the resident to tell you, knowing when the event happened, being able to have an, you know, intelligent conversation with the family members. You know when, when the resident falls, and being able to make the right decision as far as whether they need to be sent to the hospital or not before safely you this was the conversation that our executive directors would have with families, and that was we walked into your into your mother's room, she was on the floor. She can't really describe what happened. We have to send her out, just as a safety precaution, and, oh, by the way, you have to meet her at the hospital. Now, the conversation that we have and, and also, we don't know how long she was on the floor. Okay, so you don't build a lot of trust with that kind of conversation, especially if they're brand new at the community, whereas now my conversation is safely alerted us, our staff were there in two and a half minutes. We watched the video before the ambulance got there, she didn't hit her head. She's not complaining of pain. We don't recommend sending her out. And you're instantly building trust, because you know what happens. You know what happened. And so it's been a game changer in that, in that regard with building trust. And I do believe that, you know, we're seeing a longer length of stay with our residents in the memory care. I mean, Saint Louis did an analysis for us that showed a pretty significant length of stay. And, you know, we're charging 10 to $14,000 a month for memory care. I mean, an extra couple of months makes a big difference at being able to keep your that area full. So with the with the Guardian Pro and being able to offer the similar product, the same product, on the assisted living side of our business, because you have memory loss in assisted living too. Okay, we just happen to have a special program that we provide more support. But every assisted living provider has the same customer, and they're aging in place, and they have early stages of memory loss, and some of those you you know, you may not be able to completely rely upon telling you what happened or how long they were on the floor. So and you do have residents that are high fall risk, so our intent, and we've done a pilot at two communities on the assisted living side. Earlier this year, we did a 90 day pilot. We had five cameras, and we did a community in Chicago, and we did a community in Orange County, California, and basically similar results, I mean, similar level of detections, you know, out of that 90 day, you know, 10 resident, you know, you know, pilot that we did, We only had to send one resident to the hospital. The hospital. So we do see that there's an opportunity on the assisted living side. I don't know how, how many cameras we'll have going, but we're, we've made the business decision where we're going to buy. You know, we're budgeting for 12 or 15 cameras at all of our communities where we have safely you and where we have, you know, strong enough Wi Fi and you know, we're going to start with probably, you know, six or so at each community and identify those residents that are that already have a history of falls with us, and you know, and try to charge a nominal fee for it, 250, 300 bucks a month. Or if that resident is already in our highest level of care, and if they're high fall risk, they may already be in that highest level of care. We'll just waive that fee and it's bundled into that highest level of care. Because, again, it's better for us to know what's happened with the fall try to avoid sending somebody to hospital, or, you know, try to prevent litigation, that sort of thing, yeah, but you know, again, maintaining trust with the customer because, you know, thank you. And I also see the benefits, you know, safely has a couple new products, services that we had not piloted yet, and I don't know the names of them, but one is where they can check in throughout the night, every hour to make sure the residents safely in their bed. The other one is where they're monitoring several cameras at a time, but kind of eyes on the resident in their room, and again, you know, trying to keep them safe and that they're doing something unsafe and alerting our staff. So on the assisted living side, I do see the potential for using those services. In fact, we're going to try it out here, potentially with with our CEOs father. He lives in a community nearby us, and we're installing three of the Guardian pro cameras into his two bedroom unit. He's high fall risk, and I think we're going to try one of these services,
we mean, let's, let me first talk about the memory care. So we have in almost all of our memory care units. I think we have four communities where we don't have safely U we're adding the cameras in 25 to that to one of the one of the four, and it's really just a cost issue that they're the lowest margin buildings for us, and we just didn't want to absorb more cost.

She can't really describe what happened. We have to send her out, just as a safety precaution, and, oh, by the way, you have to meet her at the hospital. Now, the conversation that we have and, and also, we don't know how long she was on the floor. Okay, so you don't build a lot of trust with that kind of conversation, especially if they're brand new at the community, whereas now my conversation is safely alerted us, our staff were there in two and a half minutes. We watched the video before the ambulance got there, she didn't hit her head. She's not complaining of pain. We don't recommend sending her out. And you're instantly building trust, because you know what happens. You know what happened. And so it's been a game changer in that, in that regard with building trust. And I do believe that, you know, we're seeing a longer length of stay with our residents in the memory care. I mean, Saint Louis did an analysis for us that showed a pretty significant length of stay. And, you know, we're charging 10 to $14,000 a month for memory care. I mean, an extra couple of months makes a big difference at being able to keep your that area full. So with the with the Guardian Pro and being able to offer the similar product, the same product, on the assisted living side of our business, because you have memory loss in assisted living too. Okay, we just happen to have a special program that we provide more support. But every assisted living provider has the same customer, and they're aging in place, and they have early stages of memory loss, and some of those you you know, you may not be able to completely rely upon telling you what happened or how long they were on the floor. So and you do have residents that are high fall risk, so our intent, and we've done a pilot at two communities on the assisted living side. Earlier this year, we did a 90 day pilot. We had five cameras, and we did a community in Chicago, and we did a community in Orange County, California, and basically similar results, I mean, similar level of detections, you know, out of that 90 day, you know, 10 resident, you know, you know, pilot that we did, We only had to send one resident to the hospital. The hospital. So we do see that there's an opportunity on the assisted living side. I don't know how, how many cameras we'll have going, but we're, we've made the business decision where we're going to buy. You know, we're budgeting for 12 or 15 cameras at all of our communities where we have safely you and where we have, you know, strong enough Wi Fi and you know, we're going to start with probably, you know, six or so at each community and identify those residents that are that already have a history of falls with us, and you know, and try to charge a nominal fee for it, 250, 300 bucks a month. Or if that resident is already in our highest level of care, and if they're high fall risk, they may already be in that highest level of care. We'll just waive that fee and it's bundled into that highest level of care. Because, again, it's better for us to know what's happened with the fall try to avoid sending somebody to hospital, or, you know, try to prevent litigation, that sort of thing, yeah, but you know, again, maintaining trust with the customer because, you know, thank you. And I also see the benefits, you know, safely has a couple new products, services that we had not piloted yet, and I don't know the names of them, but one is where they can check in throughout the night, every hour to make sure the residents safely in their bed. The other one is where they're monitoring several cameras at a time, but kind of eyes on the resident in their room, and again, you know, trying to keep them safe and that they're doing something unsafe and alerting our staff. So on the assisted living side, I do see the potential for using those services. In fact, we're going to try it out here, potentially with with our CEOs father. He lives in a community nearby us, and we're installing three of the Guardian pro cameras into his two bedroom unit. He's high fall risk, and I think we're going to try one of these services,
we mean, let's, let me first talk about the memory care. So we have in almost all of our memory care units. I think we have four communities where we don't have safely U we're adding the cameras in 25 to that to one of the one of the four, and it's really just a cost issue that they're the lowest margin buildings for us, and we just didn't want to absorb more cost. But we we don't charge an extra fee for safely you. We just kind of build it into our rental rate. And the reason we took that approach with secured memory care is because we saw the value of knowing what's really happening with the customer when they fall, and so we didn't want there to be a barrier with the customer and us saying, you know, we have the safely you product. It's, you know, we'll detect falls. Here are the benefits. And, oh, by the way, it's going to cost you another $300 a month and have the customer say, No, we don't want to pay anymore. So for secured memory care, we just made the business decision early on, that it's just part of the rent. And the benefits that we see is, you know, knowing what happened to that resident, because you can't rely on the resident to tell you, knowing when the event happened, being able to have an, you know, intelligent conversation with the family members. You know when, when the resident falls, and being able to make the right decision as far as whether they need to be sent to the hospital or not before safely you this was the conversation that our executive directors would have with families, and that was we walked into your into your mother's room, she was on the floor.

The other part of the question is,
S Speaker 118:06George mentioned that because they just started rolling out this new camera without you don't have to run ethernet cables. What we wanted to understand is so as we're looking at the business for your visibility, which is, as we look at the business, the business itself looks much healthier because the cost of installation, even on the company, if without the Ethernet cable. So we wanted to see validate the like, how did Are you familiar with how was the installation like? And are you seeing any improvements with the new hardware at all? For Yeah,

S Speaker 318:45I mean, the installation of it, the advantage of the new camera is that it's plug and play. So you could train your building engineer, your maintenance guy, to install it. And you know the need for the service, especially on the assisted living side. You know if a resident has a fall, they don't have a camera yet. Okay, you're it's the perfect opportunity to add them to the program and add the camera. So if you can do that pretty quickly and within 20 hours have the camera installed and functioning, then you know the customer is going to see the benefit of it. If you have to wait a month to have it installed, you know your risk. You know that opportunity, that opportunity passes so and you want, you know, because nobody thinks they need this until they have a ball and they need it.

S Speaker 119:55so time to install is also very important. So right now in your community. So, George says there's two ways people do this with the new camera. One is they do it themselves, or second, he has they send out. So with

S Speaker 320:10the pilots we had safely you their teams do the installation. Okay, so we're about to do our first install ourselves. So you got to test out the cameras on stuff. But what I'm told is it's, it's pretty quick, okay,

well, you just have to plug it into a power Yeah.
well, you just have to plug it into a power Yeah.
S Speaker 320:34And the other thing for us, I mean, we, we pay for so our communities are roughly 150 units on average. Typically, you have, we have anywhere from 25 to 50 units that are secured memory care, and they're all those are hard wired, yeah, okay, they're all active, and we're paying the fee on all of them, whether they're being used or or not, but it gives us the flexibility to expand it on an as needed basis. On the assisted living side, because we don't know what the need is, and we don't want to have to force people to move to a different room, because they're typically pretty settled in the room that they have. So being able to have as residents age in place and become a higher fall risk, to be able to, you know, set it up within moments and activate it within moments.

and also have you um,
and also have you um,
and also have you um,
S Speaker 323:23you know, you have to your equity partner has to be part of the decision, because you're adding additional costs. Now, most of them understand, I mean, all of I've had this conversation with every single one of our equity partners, of which we have five, and they get it and they understand it. When I talked to them this year about expanding it, no questions

S Speaker 123:46asked, really, because, because you saw otherwise,
asked, really, because, because you saw otherwise,
asked, really, because, because you saw otherwise,
asked, really, because, because you saw otherwise,
S Speaker 323:49because, because I showed them the data that showed a significant decrease in the number of falls, but more importantly, showed a significant increase decrease in falls with injuries. Okay, that's where it becomes a cost on your liability insurance side. So if you can reduce falls with injuries, which, which, and I'll be honest, surprised me, but we both reduce so this is how this is this how it happens. Yeah. So as an operator, you learn so much from watching the falls on the video that you're able to take action to proactively prevent future falls, not just with that resident, but other residents as well. So, you know, there's a variety of things that you do. We we have fall huddles with safely. You once or twice a month to watch the falls. They'll make recommendations. We learn from those recommendations. And it kind of, you know, repeats itself, you know, throughout the community, but it's you know, it's how you position the furniture of the room. It's what you do at night with our residents, to make sure that they have everything they need close to them to so they don't have to get up out of that. It's, you know, it's knowing that your resident always gets up at two in the morning to get up and go the bathroom. Well, maybe we go in at 130 and we get him up and take him to the bathroom, and that way he's being he's safe. So it's all that stuff that you learn, that you kind of create this whole culture of safety, whether there's a camera on or not. So so when I showed that data to our partners, it's hard to dispute that there's value to this. And also we showed it to our insurance brokers this last year at renewal time, yeah, and, and, and that's really, you know, as an industry, that's, that's who you need to bring into the into the conference, into the conversation.

But you know that's all about reducing the cost of health care for your seniors, for your residents. And just imagine every time you send them out to the emergency room, whether they need to be there or not. I mean how much it costs, and if you can, you know, reduce the number of trips to the hospital, especially the unnecessary ones. Yeah, you know, there's gonna be huge savings, you know, as far as Medicare. So Medicare is, you know, is really trying to push this program. And there's, you know, bonus opportunities and so forth, as an operator, but I see the bigger opportunity being that, you know, you have somebody else pay for the fee, the insurance company or Medicare, you know, whoever

S Speaker 328:40so we have a couple university affiliated projects, retirement communities. So we were building our second community, which is is project that is affiliated with UC Berkeley, yes, and it's located about a mile from campus, and it's now been open for seven, eight years, something like that, and it's full of retired professors and faculty members and alumni at the university and and when it was under Construction, we had a lot of communication with the university and their retirement center, and, you know, just as far as their learning process, so we got invited to go to their innovation lab. And George was a still student finishing up his PhD at the time. And that's how we met George, because he was, he had developed, you know, the the early stages of this, of this product, while he was a student there, working in the innovation lab. So he, you know, after we opened up, he reached out and and he was very persistent, as I'm sure you've experienced as well, and you know, so I talked to him over a series of years, I just wasn't willing to be the first customer. Yeah, but then 2019 1819, we, we agreed to do a pilot. And we did a pilot at that community that's affiliated with Berkeley, and then one other location, and immediately was, was, you know, was successful. We saw the benefit, yeah, and we made the decision pretty quickly to expand it everywhere. But then in 2020, COVID hit, so we had to slow down our plans, but we still moved forward with it. It just took a little bit longer to implement so. And then turns out that, you know, we're based here in Houston, and George is from Houston. His mother, I think he grew up real close to our offices. So, you know, there's that been that connection too.

S Speaker 331:17other at that time, there wasn't much. But you know, there's, we've seen other other products. And, you know, I think it's more than just the technology and the products, the service that they provide to and, you know, we pay the extra fee for the monthly Fauci

S Speaker 332:03the visuals are important. I mean, you're able to see what happened prior to fall, yeah, because it goes back, what, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, yeah. And you could see what, what's what, you know, what potentially caused before and and sometimes, you know, they're, they're just slipping out of bed, you know, in the middle of night. And if there are things you could do to prevent them from from sliding down, sliding up, that so we are, we're, we're a big fan, and I'm excited to start out to try out some of these new products.
