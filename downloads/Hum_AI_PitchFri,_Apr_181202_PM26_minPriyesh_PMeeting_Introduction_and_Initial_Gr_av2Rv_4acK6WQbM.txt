S Speaker 10:30was nice. It was nice. I'm personally taking a broad look at physical AI for the fund. And it meant, I meant to quite, quite a good companies in that spaces, digital twins, robotic brains, some CFP simulators. So quite a good number of companies. Nelson, how was it for you? Did you? Did you get the lead you were expecting? Yeah, it

S Speaker 22:06the team. Well, we're distributed at headquarters is in Waterloo, Canada, about an hour from Toronto. Most of the founding team is from Waterloo University. So officially based there, my co founders are actually in San Francisco most of the time now. We actually just did raise invest so do a lot of work with investors here. And it looks like we're gonna be moving the company here, which, I mean, great for me, and it is obviously the place to be. I don't know. I kind of like working for Canadian companies. I guess we'll still be Canadian, better. I like that, the diversity. Yeah, it looks like we'll probably be moving here. So the answer is, sort of makes better. That's very

S Speaker 12:46interesting lesson. So jumping into the conversation, I think why I wanted to reconnect with the fact that we are very actively looking at physical AI companies. We feel this is a space which has gotten a new breadth now that tentative area is being applied to these spaces. And we have spoken to a few more Earth modeling companies. So I wouldn't say exactly in the space that you have operated, but more on weather prediction, crop yield things. And would love to know more exactly about how may I Where are you at? I understand you have raised up the ground. There might be another fundraising coming up, so we would like to explore that. And then at the same time, at Qualcomm ventures, we try to partner with some of our starters very closely. So there will be opportunities internally with Qualcomm to see if we can do something together, either on GTM forever. Duty team in front. So

S Speaker 110:12customers, that's that's very interesting. Thanks a lot for the overview. There's a lot to unpack in there. And the way you're going on, I can see how excited you are about this. So Nelson, a few of my own space I am under the impression that most of the data sets that you can build an Earth model right now are public. Is it? Is it true? And if so, would you say the core information that you work on is the data infrastructure? I was saying that the core data sets that you can train the model on are public right now, most of the data sets. Is that true, and if so is, it is the core innovation around the data infrastructure
customers, that's that's very interesting. Thanks a lot for the overview. There's a lot to unpack in there. And the way you're going on, I can see how excited you are about this.

10:49that you build? Yeah, good question.
that you build? Yeah, good question.
that you build? Yeah, good question.
that you build? Yeah, good question.
S Speaker 210:53No, yes. So I'm sure we have used all of the open data in the world, all of it, but we have a lot give us a lot of private data as well, and so, so yeah, we've done more than just open public data. We think that's really important. We want to be satellite agnostic, able to serve customers that require very different kinds of data, whether it's resolution type or data type. So to get the models trained on more than and while the Coronavirus, I think, is a twin data engine and foundation model right, because precisely because the model is trained on the model is trained on the kind of diversity and scale of data that our customers need, we've been able to really innovate on things like optimization for data science, optimization for Gen AI language, etc. And then the model, obviously, since we built it from scratch, is, is really the core IP, right? The data driven is really interesting, impressive, and it thrives, right? The foundation model. So obviously both of those, and both are optimized for any data satellite, and we're doing racial data generally. So it's not just we look at we have customers looking at their own data, flyover data. We've got sensors to ground truth. We even work with diver data in some cases where it's so sensitive, for example, with San Diego connected to the Navy, we do a lot of analysis, and some of it access to the ground truth. But by human beings actually making sure that, you know, some little piece of this is exactly what we say. Because, you know, they're more so simple. And so, yeah, so the diversity of Operation data is mainly satellite that scale is, but we go well beyond that understood that's simple.

S Speaker 112:16And you mentioned, you already have a model out there in the marketplace. Can you tell me a little bit more about that? How do you measure the accuracy? Or how do you benchmark such models? Yes, yeah.

S Speaker 212:37trying to publish it on first because I read a blog about which changed our name from coastal carbon to home AIS, and I wrote a blog we get under, get under the skin, and like what we're really trying to do. So I think we're talking about publishing my blog in the paper on Earth Day, which is next week. In any case, we've written it, and, yeah, we're very unique to making sure that we're, well, that just us, but the field right? Benchmarking in meaningful ways, and benchmarking not just to the mechanistic sort of

workings of the model, but in terms of
workings of the model, but in terms of
workings of the model, but in terms of
S Speaker 213:06your question around accuracy or facility or explainability or diversity use cases, I think that's where the the benchmarking really needs to go. And so we're working a lot on that in this academic paper. We'll show you that. So there was a second part of your question. We talked about benchmarking,
your question around accuracy or facility or explainability or diversity use cases, I think that's where the the benchmarking really needs to go.

S Speaker 113:26how are the customers reacting to it? What? What is? What I'm trying to come at is you are, in a way, forecasting the future, and it's much easier to do that for an LLM per se. But what's the ground source approach that you use to prove the forecast is right? Yeah, it depends on the use
how are the customers reacting to it? What? What is? What I'm trying to come at is you are, in a way, forecasting the future, and it's much easier to do that for an LLM per se. But what's the ground source approach that you use to prove the forecast is right? Yeah, it depends on the use

S Speaker 122:01understand that, Nelson, there's this tons of follow up questions I have here, but, but I do have a commitment, so I will have to run so I'll ask you one last question before we end today. What's, what's the vision for the founding team here? Nelson, do you, are you in the best case scenario, targeting an acquisition some somewhere. Do you plan to make it a big, billion dollar company? How are you thinking about it and the fundraise? When do you plan to start the next round? How big a round Do you think you'll be? Yeah,

S Speaker 125:29Sounds great, dancing. Let me come back with some follow up questions I would appreciate when, when the blog is up and when the research paper is up. Would love to read through them as well. I do have a few portfolio companies in mind, which might use the technology today. Let me have a conversation internally there, and then also on that front. And finally, as a follow up call, I'd like to involve some members of my team that might not be next week, but probably a week after, once we have done with the study and we have some initial convictions on how we are going to approach the market. So I would like to loop in some more members of the team and talk have a discussion on the fundraising part. Fantastic.

I do have a few portfolio companies in mind, which might use the technology today. Let me have a conversation internally there, and then also on that front. And finally, as a follow up call, I'd like to involve some members of my team that might not be next week, but probably a week after, once we have done with the study and we have some initial convictions on how we are going to approach the market. So I would like to loop in some more members of the team and talk have a discussion on the fundraising part. Fantastic.
