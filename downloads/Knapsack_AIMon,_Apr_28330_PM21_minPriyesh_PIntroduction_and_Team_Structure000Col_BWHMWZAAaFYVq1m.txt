S Speaker 10:11Absolutely, Mark, remind me again, you're in SF, right? That's right, yeah. Okay, perfect. So how sorry I didn't get you. Whereabouts are you? I'm in the bay area as well. Yeah. Okay, wonderful. So our team, I would say, 10 member team. Six of us are here in Bay Area, four of us in San Diego. Very cool. So great to be connected again. Would love to talk further on, knapsack. I just went to your website. Read a little bit about the entire industry. So have some input points. But would you points, but we'd love to understand, I think, this time, more about where the business is at. How are you thinking about growing it things around that? And then happy to have another follow up call with some more members of the team. And before we start, Mark, I think I was reading somewhere at you, you have a few angels from Qualcomm in your pre feed round. Is that? Is that true? Oh, that's good to know. And are you working with, given that you have a very strong focus on on device inference, are you working with anyone on the aipc team so far?

S Speaker 21:13Yes, I've been in touch with the dev rel team, and so I think you may, I think you might have picked this up. We actually hosted an event at payjoy with the dev rel team, so we had the same team that was actually doing the event, had actually come to my former company and done an event there. And then on top of that, we LinkedIn and started we obviously, we created a version of firms, arm 64 we started talking through ways we could deploy. I think there's a nice opportunity. I think we might have talked about this briefly, like a nice opportunity to do more. I don't think we're talking to developers. I think we're talking to the PC distribution and marketing team. Yeah. I think this is what we talked about at the hotel, getting a really big opportunity for an app that justifies the investment in, you know, a non device, NPU, and, you know, enables that. And that's really the direction we're going. So I think it would be good to link up with people

S Speaker 11:57on your side, for sure, for sure. Yeah, talking. Can work with work on that with you. We have, very recently, me, and I was working with managing directors, we have done AI investment in an AI suite, so if you will, that that app runs locally on device, not all of the workflow, but many of it, can do web research, analyze your data sheets, your local files, and create presentation, spreadsheets, analysis, visualizations, all kind of things for you. So for sure, that's something that we would love to explore further. Anything that I can fill you in on how the fund operates and cases things like that, before we understand,

S Speaker 12:33seed round, absolutely, I think we, we just in the US team deploy about 150 100 $80 million a year, And the plan is to do that over 10 to 15 companies. We have aI application for us this year. We have done a couple of investments in that space earlier this year, last year, December, and plan to be more focused on that space. I'll say, last couple of years, a good focus area was on the infrastructure list. So hugging face, anthropic scale, AI weights and biases of some companies in the foundation model and tooling layer that we have done now the focus area is on AI field, with Qualcomm having some making some bets and edge AI we can we have a strategic value add for some of these companies, and that's why we are planning to make a more strategic look at that space now. So the team is actively looking at a lot of video AI companies, AI in productivity suite, like the company I mentioned earlier, and apps Act would fit in that same thesis, a lot of agentic AI frameworks and horizontal AI companies, so big for this area, our check sizes are two to $15 million and typically, I would say the lower end of it has been something that we have been experimenting, experimenting with more recently. Typically, we were a series A plus investor. But what we have realized, especially in this AI agentic ai ai application space, that you have to go in a little bit early, and that's why we have started doing more seed recently. I would say the short effect is coming for seed rounds, which we do, which we do more, I would say opportunistically in the right companies when it makes sense, and we have a strategic fit. But other than that, still a series investor. That's why most of our thematic focuses.

S Speaker 14:00follow up. So we lead, I would say probably 20% of our investments in and we follow. We do not often take board seats. We just take board of deliver seats.

S Speaker 14:14So I would say most of the deals that come pass through a venture team would be where we will be following on. Many deals originate from the business units and where we have a very strong subject site we are strong strategic trade. We are probably the biggest customer for the company. We think we can co develop the some, some product proposition together. So that's where we sometimes lead. But I would still say wouldn't count on us as the lead investor. Got it.

S Speaker 110:08Mark just your insights about this market. Why do you think an on prem deployment of an NLM fine tuned on some of these specific workflows by a company like yards adaptive, all of these enterprise AI adoption companies wouldn't work, versus an app site with a prosumer focus here. So I'm saying is you, you have a way, let's say a prosumer app to automate some of these compliance audits. Why? Why do you think LLM fine tuned on some of these workflows with some of the proprietary data launched by a ton of companies out there which provide enterprise ml solutions is not a better

S Speaker 210:45so versus, like enterprise on prem, LM, deploy, yeah. I mean, we're really talking about the these are organizations that don't engage these kind of professional service firms you're talking about. These are generally the financial advice we're talking about. Are, you know, have between five and 20 employees. They are looking for a turnkey solution that works immediately. They are not the JP Morgans of the world, Capgemini to do this kind of thing, right? Yeah. And so that's, that's the main reason, I think, at the same time, I just want to be clear that the, well, I mean, the prosumer app is actually a starting point, but ultimately, what we're doing with these clients is we're actually creating these custom automations which are called maps. This is one example of one which basically allow them to privately run these automations that are customized to their view. So it's actually a mass customized way to deploy private AI where it completely plugs into their requirements. So from their point of view, it's actually probably feels like a professional services arrangement, but is significantly cheaper. I mean, our typical contract value is about $30,000 I think what you're decoding is to run between 102 100k

S Speaker 111:42right? I get that totally This is very interesting. Let's dig a little bit deeper on the maps. Part of things. Your earlier slide mentioned turnkey automations, and you're starting with the with automating the back offices. How could this market look like down the line? I get the value proposition today is on pre deployments, very sensitive industry, and hence this wedge would work versus a ton of other meeting automation companies. But where do you plan to expand down the line, and what is on the roadmap?

S Speaker 113:09all of, let's say, on an app store or the maps that you would create. Would you say these would work out of the box for most workflows? Do you think there are the work? Do you think there's enough variation in the workflow that they might not work out of the box? Would you need a reinforcement learning kind of feedback loop to sort of make these more accurate?

S Speaker 213:25two levels of customization. So one is the reinforcement learning, where I think there's gonna be a lot of potential here, and people reusing these maps, and also maybe even slightly customizing them to their their needs. And so, you know, we are included introducing an app editor which allows people to create their own that's on roadmap for the next six to 12 months. Ultimately, you know, we still, let's say they see this in the VIP map, and they're like, this is great. I actually love it, but I want to make two or three changes. Can actually, you know, make a few changes and publish their own, and they can, you know, still, in using it, improve some of the models, and on the back end, like you said, for reinforcement learning, I think the second piece of it is actually the desire for significant you know, we're having a number conversation people who say, you know, I love what I'm hearing here, but actually we're interested in two or three very specific things that will have a dramatic impact on, you know, our back office cost savings. And if you could do this, then you know, it's gonna have a really big impact. So take what you've done here, but actually make some changes to it. And I think this is a need for that. And ultimately, over time, we see those contract values. Now we're at about 30,000 you know, we see that increasing. You know, at the top end, large professional services firm charge about $20,000 per year from that. We don't need to charge that because we barely in cost structure, but we definitely see the ability to keep an enterprise business going with a CDs of between 15 100k interesting.

14:43That makes sense.
S Speaker 114:46I'm putting this out bluntly, Mark, and would love your thoughts very broadly, top level view. If you there's a highly sensitive industry, the data in there isn't sensitive in you. Hence you cannot use a lot of out of the box solutions, and you build a broader vision for a lot of workflow automation for that specific industry. What's your secret sauce to be winning this? Because very generally, going through the same phase. And I'm sure for financial services, there would be other AI native companies trying to own the specific market as well. And then at the same time, you have horizontal automation companies, which may introduce on prem, on on device compute down the line, and allow users to build their own no code sort of automations. So how do you win against all of this together? What's the together? What's the secret

S Speaker 215:23sauce? Yeah, so I think, I think, just to be blunt in the app space there, it's very hard to build sustainable modes. We should just be really honest about that. So team and momentum is always going to be significant in any of these areas. That said, I mean, ultimately, what we are focused on here is the regulated industries, and building a very specific suite of tooling, turnkey automations that are specific to these regulated industries. So we're beginning with financial service providers, expanding out from that, from that point, within that area of financial service providers, I think, I mean, really, there is a lot of really important last mile work to be done to have this work turnkey. You know, I'll give you a very specific example. So we spent a lot of time with it, and someone active in the insurance industry. There are some very specific workflows around illustrations from these insurance policies and making sure that these illustrations that are submitted on a quarterly basis are analyzed and then actions taken on a regular basis. This fairly intricate workflow is something that we can engage and deal with ultimately. I mean, I'm very familiar with the more horizontal tools. I don't see any of them. Tools. I don't see any of them getting into this level of detail. And I also think to have something that is functional in the space. I think the the incentive of someone to redo that work elsewhere is going to be very limited. So ultimately, I think that focus of making this, this map store, is ultimately, I mean, ultimately, having a suite of automations that are turnkey, that just work, are really going to make it easier to for people to plug into knapsack than on their own. And ultimately, that lives above the LLM layer. So we're always going to use the best of breed LLM. So we're not claiming that building our model is the mode, and I don't think that's a good mode. I think ultimately, you know, having a, yeah, having a set of turnkey software that ultimately replaces a lot of manual work, and also replaces a lot of the SAS tools that people are using that's going to end up
sauce? Yeah, so I think, I think, just to be blunt in the app space there, it's very hard to build sustainable modes. We should just be really honest about that.

S Speaker 117:04being in the mode mentioned, not trying to train your own LLM that makes a lot of sense. No point spending capex on that. But are you thinking of doing any level of, I would say, Fine tuning on the llms, developing a model called Priyesh to figuring out which and what kind of llms and what different sort of open source, closed source closed source models work for which does, and then creating autosuit around that.

I think what's
S Speaker 217:25really interesting as well LMS and small language models. I think there's gonna be a really interesting problem area around making sure we're choosing the right small language model for the right task. And so we're already actually seeing some of this with some of our workflows and our automations. There are some that are more run summarization. And those summarization tasks can use a B model until one of our clients is locally, and that's working very well. Then there are some other tasks that require detailed analysis of data. This one that I've presented here, that requires a 70 me model. And then I think there are some tasks where something like Maverick is turns out to be much more suitable, and I think routing and orchestrating that. And then ultimately, I think there is scope for us to take one of those for some of these automations. We always have to start with the thing that someone wants to do and make sure you're doing an amazing job at it. And that's really what we spend most of

S Speaker 218:29action as well? Yeah, so this is two point approach. So first of all, we do target brand building to make sure that we are very well regarded and well written. So within the finance professional space, it's a very reputation based space that we partner with key influencers like James Campbell from most tech select platform that we partnered with future proof, which is a leaders retrieval partner with that we're going to be co branding with them at an event they have next month. And so this gives people insight and confidence in terms of what we're doing. And then we then do direct marketing. One beautiful thing about the financial advisor space is we have a database of every single financial advisor in the US, so we reach out to them directly, allow them to book an automation, something in real time in front of them, within 45 minutes, and then within about four weeks, we generally have not only an invoice issue, but money in the bank. So it's a very short sale cycle. And so we're now at about 30k per month, and growing. This is a motion we really started, like three months ago, and it's directly bearing fruit. So we're not just waiting for we've obviously done some SEO, and we've done a fair amount of content leaning in, and we have a fairly repeatable playbook that's

I just want to be clear right now, because our workflows generally require model greater and because our target user does not have a PC that can run that locally, we are using ephemeral compute at this point. So I just want to be clear about that so we position ourselves for being able to run locally, but at this point, it

S Speaker 120:17is ephemeral compute. This is pretty interesting. Would love to have the team involved. Have a follow on chart, some details on the on how the round is. You think you mentioned 5 million feet round at the moment? Is that correct? That's right. And are you, are you looking to price that round? Are you planning to structure the round? What's, what would the composition look like in your mind? Yeah.

S Speaker 220:32So we're now focused on leads. We have a fair amount of follower interest, you know. So we have like, two to 3 million of our interest. We don't know where we're gonna go with followers versus leads. Ultimately, most of these we talked to are looking for, you know, an investment, often a 10% stake in the company. And so, you know, we will obviously let the lead price that out, but ultimately we expect the followers will probably need to, you know, won't be able to include all the followers. That's what, that's what I imagine. So we're really looking at is who is going to lead the round, and, yeah, I mean, to that extent, I think the most important thing is understanding, is Qualcomm interested in slash in a position to lead, or is it better for us to spend our energy looking for a lead and then looping back if we signed a lead and so it'd be

S Speaker 121:06great. Yeah, absolutely. Mark. I would like to hold on to that thought. Finally, say, you you thinking of a check side of three, three and a half things like that, something like on that range. I imagine two to three is what we're looking at here. Okay, okay. I would like to hold on to that thought part because this does fit in a spot, I would say, but would still like to sort of verify that to the team if we could, but I'll come back to you by mid this week. Okay, cool. And so
