S Speaker 10:00Um, I am on okra. I was I am working with the MedTech Innovator which is a venture accelerator in itself. Based out of LA, I have a background of being a machine learning engineer at Adobe, and I have my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering. Okay. My other teammates are one as Natalia, who has a bioinformatics background and has been an ex entrepreneurial leader. Now is an MBA student at Anderson itself. The other one is Amanda, who is an MD student at the David Geffen School of Medicine that is UCLA. Oh, yeah. And she has she has an interest in OBGYN. So she has worked with all of these high risk obstetricians at UCLA. And the next is pre age. He has a biotechnology background from his undergrad and he has been a startup consultant earlier. He is now working in the venture capital space and has worked with Morpheus ventures and yeah, I meant low. And the last teammate that we have is Neha. She is a person who has a computer science background and has product management skills and you know, she had says with the designing of prototypes, and has she also has like data analysts background.

Okay. Okay. Just one of the I think team member has experienced in that way.
S Speaker 11:51Yeah. Basically, one of the domains has experience in venture capital.
Yeah. Basically, one of the domains has experience in venture capital.
Yeah. Basically, one of the domains has experience in venture capital.
Yeah. Basically, one of the domains has experience in venture capital.
S Speaker 21:55Yeah, yeah. So yeah. Okay. Just go ahead. Sorry to stop
Yeah, yeah. So yeah. Okay. Just go ahead. Sorry to stop
Yeah, yeah. So yeah. Okay. Just go ahead. Sorry to stop
Yeah, yeah. So yeah. Okay. Just go ahead. Sorry to stop
S Speaker 27:15great. So for the Florida for doctors. Are you going to like cooperate with the doctors who has already like the job in the public hospital? Or?
great. So for the Florida for doctors. Are you going to like cooperate with the doctors who has already like the job in the public hospital? Or?
great. So for the Florida for doctors. Are you going to like cooperate with the doctors who has already like the job in the public hospital? Or?
great. So for the Florida for doctors. Are you going to like cooperate with the doctors who has already like the job in the public hospital? Or?
S Speaker 27:36yeah. I'm just wondering what's the source of? Yeah, I don't I don't know that exact like I'm working a lot of doctor in a hospital or private hospital. So I don't know if they have enough time, or energy or motivation to cooperate with us online.
yeah. I'm just wondering what's the source of? Yeah, I don't I don't know that exact like I'm working a lot of doctor in a hospital or private hospital. So I don't know if they have enough time, or energy or motivation to cooperate with us online.

S Speaker 17:56So there are multiple values that the doctors are actually getting out of this. Firstly, they save on a lot of energy that is spent otherwise on handling the patients in the hospital. So when you typically call these patients in the hospital, they occupy a lot of the healthcare staffs time, you know, around more than an hour typically interacting with the you know, just coming into the hospital, getting all the records failed, and then strapping them to the machine and then monitoring them through the test. And here, the doctor will just need to spend a couple of minutes at the final stage when the graph is printed. The doctor does not need to be talking to the patient throughout the duration of the test, which is anywhere between 20 to 60 minutes. So there is profound value for the doctor and this and the second thing which the doctors appreciate about it is that if there is a poor neonatal outcome in terms of lettuces, stillbirth, the doctor is liable for it. But if the outcomes of the babies you know improve, if there are more chances of the woman delivering a healthy baby basically doctors improve their outcomes, thus reducing their legal liability. Oh, yeah,

Oh, yeah,
S Speaker 29:23that's great. Yeah. Very great one. Yeah. Like without your introduction, I don't even like notice because the software, the liability division Yeah. Great. Okay, just go ahead.
that's great. Yeah. Very great one. Yeah. Like without your introduction, I don't even like notice because the software, the liability division Yeah. Great. Okay, just go ahead.
that's great. Yeah. Very great one. Yeah. Like without your introduction, I don't even like notice because the software, the liability division Yeah. Great. Okay, just go ahead.
that's great. Yeah. Very great one. Yeah. Like without your introduction, I don't even like notice because the software, the liability division Yeah. Great. Okay, just go ahead.
S Speaker 210:52in the future with with like more larger coverage on the patient's data, so you are going to expand service fails right? It could not only like provide monitoring or consulting services in terms of pregnancy, but also on other health issues. Where are those women, right?
in the future with with like more larger coverage on the patient's data, so you are going to expand service fails right? It could not only like provide monitoring or consulting services in terms of pregnancy, but also on other health issues. Where are those women, right?

S Speaker 111:16Ah, not actually all of the concerns that we are looking at right now. are more or less around pregnancy.
Ah, not actually all of the concerns that we are looking at right now. are more or less around pregnancy.
Ah, not actually all of the concerns that we are looking at right now. are more or less around pregnancy.
Ah, not actually all of the concerns that we are looking at right now. are more or less around pregnancy.
S Speaker 211:23So I still focused on pregnancy but yeah, we just
S Speaker 111:28plan to make the value proposition during pregnancy stronger, where you know, any and everything which the doctor wants to monitor around the pregnancy would be monitored by us going forward.
plan to make the value proposition during pregnancy stronger, where you know, any and everything which the doctor wants to monitor around the pregnancy would be monitored by us going forward.

S Speaker 211:40Oh, okay. Oh, our students so sorry, everyone who says no,
Oh, okay. Oh, our students so sorry, everyone who says no,
Oh, okay. Oh, our students so sorry, everyone who says no,
Oh, okay. Oh, our students so sorry, everyone who says no,
S Speaker 212:41So that we increase like the probability that they will be laid off maybe in the next quarter or something.
So that we increase like the probability that they will be laid off maybe in the next quarter or something.
So that we increase like the probability that they will be laid off maybe in the next quarter or something.
So that we increase like the probability that they will be laid off maybe in the next quarter or something.
S Speaker 213:06So I also noticed the, like the insurers was also included as one of the player appears. So I'm wondering, how would you handle this issue like how, how insurers like act in this business.
So I also noticed the, like the insurers was also included as one of the player appears. So I'm wondering, how would you handle this issue like how, how insurers like act in this business.

S Speaker 113:23So what happens is the doctor will recommend the you know, our solution to the patient. And this will be given to the patient through the doctor itself, but it will be billed to the insurance company.
So what happens is the doctor will recommend the you know, our solution to the patient. And this will be given to the patient through the doctor itself, but it will be billed to the insurance company.
So what happens is the doctor will recommend the you know, our solution to the patient. And this will be given to the patient through the doctor itself, but it will be billed to the insurance company.
So what happens is the doctor will recommend the you know, our solution to the patient. And this will be given to the patient through the doctor itself, but it will be billed to the insurance company.
S Speaker 213:38So so so our answer is this is fully paid by the in the insurance Yeah.
So so so our answer is this is fully paid by the in the insurance Yeah.
So so so our answer is this is fully paid by the in the insurance Yeah.
So so so our answer is this is fully paid by the in the insurance Yeah.
S Speaker 113:44So there are these, like, the insurance today, even the Medicaid and the private insurances, cover remote patient monitoring in a profound way post COVID specially. So we will be leveraging all of those CPT codes which they have launched post COVID to build the insurance companies for all of this monitoring. And the reason why insurance companies benefit from this is that if today there is a poor outcome of a child, the child typically spends a lot of time in the neonatal ICU which is, you know, for these children who are born sick. So if you get this machine and machine out, there is a lesser probability of the child being born sick. So the eventual bill that these insurers have to pay will be lesser. Yeah,

S Speaker 214:39that's the thing. Yeah. So that was like largely decrease the probability of stillbirths
that's the thing. Yeah. So that was like largely decrease the probability of stillbirths
that's the thing. Yeah. So that was like largely decrease the probability of stillbirths
that's the thing. Yeah. So that was like largely decrease the probability of stillbirths
S Speaker 214:48Okay, so another thing is that what if, like a pregnant when women use this product at home and really detect something really urgent? Like, if that will be compared to the situation where this woman really took this except examination in the hospital, maybe they will need to like drive longer time to arrive at hospital is that would be a concern of you.
Okay, so another thing is that what if, like a pregnant when women use this product at home and really detect something really urgent?

S Speaker 115:20So the thing is, like, we discuss this with the doctors, and they were like that if you you're under the present system. The patient comes in at their scheduled time of appointment which means that is safe. You have a once weekly appointment, they would come every Monday. Oh, but what hours and they get to know about the problem only on that sheduled visit. But what our solution allows us that even if you know in the middle of the week, the patient feels that there's something wrong let's say the baby is moving lesser. So the mother can put herself to the machine. And she can test herself on Friday, let's say and raise an alarm on Friday and go to the hospital on Friday. So even though she has to drive that distance but the thing is, she is getting that information three days earlier than what she would have received otherwise. And this three days could lead to you know, saving of that child's life.
So the thing is, like, we discuss this with the doctors, and they were like that if you you're under the present system.

S Speaker 216:24Yeah, so that is reason not unreasonable. Like to to do Yeah, okay. Understood.
Yeah, so that is reason not unreasonable. Like to to do Yeah, okay. Understood.
Yeah, so that is reason not unreasonable. Like to to do Yeah, okay. Understood.
Yeah, so that is reason not unreasonable. Like to to do Yeah, okay. Understood.
S Speaker 116:33So, this is about it. Right now. We have developed a prototype like part of which I just showed you, and we have tested our you know, like we're using the existing hardware that's out there. But our plan is to you know, build this minimum viable product over the next one year. And eventually, you know, then once we roll that out home beats, which is just the CTG and blood pressure monitoring, once we roll that out and start getting some money in we will start working on the development of homes and which will be the longer term vision of the company.
So, this is about it. Right now. We have developed a prototype like part of which I just showed you, and we have tested our you know, like we're using the existing hardware that's out there.

S Speaker 217:16Okay, so so there's no FDA approval required for phase two right for the
Okay, so so there's no FDA approval required for phase two right for the
Okay, so so there's no FDA approval required for phase two right for the
Okay, so so there's no FDA approval required for phase two right for the
S Speaker 117:23first phase that is there. We do not require any FDA approval, which is home beads, which is basically that is a remote patient monitoring software, where we are just relaying the information to the doctor and the doctor is doing all the inference, the HomeSense which is the long term vision of the company, is a clinical decision system. So that will require FDA class to approval. And that is the reason why we want to launch home beats first so that we can start getting revenue and and we take the like you know we don't delay our revenue income to the latter part.
first phase that is there. We do not require any FDA approval, which is home beads, which is basically that is a remote patient monitoring software, where we are just relaying the information to the doctor and the doctor is doing all the inference, the HomeSense which is the long term vision of the company, is a clinical decision system.

S Speaker 218:07And yeah. So where we are right now. Are we like launch one.
And yeah. So where we are right now. Are we like launch one.
And yeah. So where we are right now. Are we like launch one.
And yeah. So where we are right now. Are we like launch one.
S Speaker 118:15We have developed a prototype right now. And we are now working on building an MVP basically an end to end product where our hardware and software's are integrated end to end. So we're working towards the first version of our final product that like home beats. Yeah. So yeah, this is the competitive landscape where, you know, we have a lot of people who are doing the hardware producing this hardware, but no one is basically adding this layer of automated software on top of it. So once we are that we will be clearly differentiated in the market. Yeah, yeah. Yep. So you also asked me the third thing around funding requirements that we are looking for right now. Yeah. So, you know, I do want the stage we are at. We are looking for a typical venture accelerator type of funding requirement where we want to raise around $250,000 and somewhere around eight to 12% of equity. We are really
We have developed a prototype right now. And we are now working on building an MVP basically an end to end product where our hardware and software's are integrated end to end. So we're working towards the first version of our final product that like home beats. Yeah. So yeah, this is the competitive landscape where, you know, we have a lot of people who are doing the hardware producing this hardware, but no one is basically adding this layer of automated software on top of it.

So once we are that we will be clearly differentiated in the market. Yeah, yeah. Yep. So you also asked me the third thing around funding requirements that we are looking for right now. Yeah. So, you know, I do want the stage we are at.
