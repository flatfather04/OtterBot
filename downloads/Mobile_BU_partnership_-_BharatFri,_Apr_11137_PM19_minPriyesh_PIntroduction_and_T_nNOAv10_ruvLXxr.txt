S Speaker 27:52so far, this is very clear, but I think my question here would be, I've floated a few companies around and they they are around these areas, specifically in agentical systems, agentic assistance, as assistance, as as we are looking at, it could be very wide. So I hope, how do you want me to first question, how do you want me to make these connections and to would your team be open to evaluating whether some of these partners are fit for the summit or not? Yes. So our team will be

S Speaker 311:13about things I can send to this slide. Yeah, because this kind of highlights what do I need to get from the partner? Yes. And the use case proposal is also kind of highlighted in this, actually. So first thing I would need to understand, what are the use cases? Because sometimes what happens is some of them work on enterprise solutions than consumer oriented. So I need to, I need to get this vetted by our marketing team, by our technology product team, that, hey, this is an enterprise use case. Does it make sense to go and support it? And if they see value, then of course we can go ahead with that, but oriented scenarios will be much more preferred

S Speaker 212:50so these, these were a few companies you can see my screen, yeah, a few companies that had suggested sardine AI here is probably given by some other team member of my team. So this wasn't through me, so, but I can, I can check internally with Sergio, and they can, they can take it forward from there. Expander and tool house, both of them are agentic AI platform companies. So on their platform, you can go and for a specific workflow, create agents for different use cases. It could be, it could it's, it's a low code platform wherein you can put some blocks together and create an AI agent for yourself. The last time, when I was discussing for them, both of them were interested in having some compute on prem or on our devices, but the discussion were more around AI PCs, so I will have to check with them if they're open to sort of also porting some of their models or some of their solutions on mobile captions. Ai, here is, is a late stage company, very, very widely known in the market. They started with an AI based captions generator for short form videos. Now they have launched their own foundation model for video creation and pro movie production. So this seems to be a very strong partner. I guess they've raised a billion dollars already. It's a strong company in the market. I will reach out to them, get back to you on what they think and Neo at the end, they are creating a game generation engine using generative AI for kids. So kids can come together on a platform and create games and then use that as well as for they can launch game in production, and then kids can play and stream it as well. So I think there are multiple use cases here. We'll have to check with them again if they are open on mobile use cases, because current, currently, the platform is of web first platform, and then they were thinking of maybe becoming a web mobile product, but I'm not sure where this fits in the timeline.

S Speaker 114:57I had a question. Priyesh, so do we have any Qualcomm team in a different view, working with any of these partners. No, not yet. Okay,

S Speaker 315:08yeah, I think Milo is interesting. Captions is definitely interesting. Saturday. I think it is interesting. Maybe if you can get some more details about what they do and that portfolio of use cases, maybe I run it with our security team as well. I think it is, it's interesting. Put it this way, and about the first two, it also depends on, you know, what sort of use cases they're enabling, whether it is enterprise, whether it is consumer, you mentioned a little bit about workflows. I don't know if it, if it's most

S Speaker 215:48of them are consumer right now. Bharat, so someone like me can go on their platform and create a workflow. Say, for example, every time I have a meeting, take the meeting transcript, get these specific notes out of it and send me an email about how the action items could be. That's one random example, but you can create these blocks of workflows for your custom use cases. So it's not one specific workflow. But how do you go on the platform create a workflow that works for you and have an agent doing that for you over and over again. So these are consumers,
