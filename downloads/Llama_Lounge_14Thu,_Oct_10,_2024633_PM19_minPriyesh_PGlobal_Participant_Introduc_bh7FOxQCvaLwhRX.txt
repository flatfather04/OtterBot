S Speaker 37:52Ladies and gentlemen, we are light Jose. Thank you very much. Hi everybody. Thanks for having me. Here. My name is Lisa. I run product at a company called data straight out, and we are a unified data API catalog. What does that mean? So one of the biggest bloggers for. Generative AI applications and ml applications today is data infrastructure. It's poor data quality. It's not being able to move data where it needs to be, and it's the governance of it. So what we do is that we build a metadata. Failure on top of all of your different sources and stores. So this is your table formats. This is your streams, structured data, and then we allow. Machine learning applications to directly interface with it in a way that's still governed and manageable and has robust access control. So if you have any. Questions around that. Please let me know. I'm happy to support you however I can. Yeah.

You can run with Oga, you can brainstorm, you can ask questions and reason. But we're working towards Ogi running not just functions, but also teams in a fully autonomous way. Now we've tracked Oga at a sales and marketing level where Oga is able to perform and achieve targets for sales and marketing teams, and now we are expanding that to different so we are here right next, behind. So happy to give you a demo on how Oga was looking forward. Thank you.
