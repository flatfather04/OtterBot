S Speaker 20:50for sure. Caitlin, so we as Qualcomm had set the context here at Qualcomm ventures. We are the venture capital arm of Qualcomm. So we will look at companies from an investment perspective. But at the same time, at Qualcomm, we have a lot of our chips and silicon go into mobiles, PCs. We have an on prem deployment suit. We also have a cloud compute suit, IoT, automobiles. A lot of other areas for some of these solutions, we are also looking to adopt some horizontal AI agent generation platform, and we are evaluating a lot of companies from that lens. So would love to understand from that perspective as well on where guidance is today. What are you building, how you're differentiating from some some of the other products in the market. So, so that's, that's broadly the context of the call, and then very quickly around the fund itself. So we are the corporate venture arm of Qualcomm. Invest typically series A plus, but sometimes we have done seed as well, especially in a IDs, and our check sizes are two to $15 million very actively deploying capital in AI. We have done good number of investments in the infrastructure and foundation model there, I'd say, hugging face, anthropic scale, AI, weights and biases. So a lot of investments in the foundation model, tooling, ml, ops, layer. Now we are actively looking at both vertical and horizontal. Ai, applications and agents.

S Speaker 13:41let me introduce you about proxy is the AI agent creation platform for business. And proxy is not the AI agents you have seen is much more than that. We must more than that. We know the AI tool, AI automation agents. We are the A agent creation platform where the business can create a agent as closely in hours, not months, the agents can adapt themselves, learn themselves, and make decision on the specific role. Text about attraction. We already launched our beta on March 24 and after a month, we got more than 200 active users and more than 100 future partners.

S Speaker 15:35data, or some targeting now is the US market. We will start with the sector of marketing agencies, tech startups, and also education tech financial firms, yeah, because most of our clients now in those sectors, and we already have case studies, and especially is marketing agency, they already have a large needs of a agent to provide a services to their clients, the the CR, the CA, dr, race is large,

S Speaker 16:14raising very fast. And the problem is more than 90% of business now have the integration issues to deploy a agents due to lack of technical expertise, integration, complexity and time and effort consuming, and they text from three months to eight months to create and and setting the A agents with launch team like but for us, we will simplify that process. Our solution would be have a agent creation platform with no code and also the required, yeah, with the drag and drop interface built in playground and allow me to channel developments like website, app or mobile, yeah, and internet platforms, any This is how we simulate the complexity with the no code platform, no code needed. Just drag and drop, and then we have API instantly, so no setup needed. We have the instant API hosting with the comprehensive tool set, any thing from data to build to optimize, everything can be managed with with our platform. And we especially have the team real time team collaboration, which is very special, because no one on the market have it. Yes, we have both build your own agents and ready to deploy agents with templates. So we have the power of grab. The platform is super to you, super easy to use, flexible control. Have the deep integration we will have real time later, so no knowledge cut off. They can analyze and monitor everything effectively about competitors. So now you know people talking the most about Korea and the differences between proxy and them is that, with proxy, with coronavi, you know, they will require high quality skills to do because they don't have the bread and drop interface. So everything very complex to use, and for any end, they are not a agents full power agents, they just AI automation with the one way workflow. So for Roxy, we have the advantage. And another advantage is that at the end, don't have the native memory right, and then career, I will be talking level memory.

S Speaker 39:36just history. Yes, it might be like that when will just with AI, and it will be mail, memory days and use for mean, deep learning. Much is yet, just like it, you don't need to train more or something like that. Sorry, I don't know. So you don't need to worry about you don't need to worry about training. Is so much
just history. Yes, it might be like that when will just with AI, and it will be mail, memory days and use for mean, deep learning.

S Speaker 110:13Okay, so about our competitive advantage, we will specifically for enterprise business and we have core technology to make it faster, more cost effective and cost saving. Yeah, we have experienced features that no one yet built in, and then we have security with a long term enterprise support, yeah, if I never they have a small team, a large team. We already have a support services to them, the business model we are mainly have the subscription model with monthly plan and yearly plan based on the credits that they use this month and how much support they use, and also for the enterprise plan, we'll have advanced API access and custom custom integration, yeah, so the marketplace would be a potential at our model, we will publish it later this year, and the target customer would be enterprise, and then small and mid sized business. We will have individual developer, but our main target would be for business. Now we are raising $500,000 for 12 months of runway. The team expansion and r&d would be 40% operation 20% business developments and marketing would be 25 and then saving will be 15 and our next mile will be 100 pay business account with average $500 a month solution. So we will reach our target 500k IRR at the end of this year, and we'll have 3000 users about our roadmap. We already done with the first quarter. We already launched our beta, and we are in the second quarter where we expand the business, monetize it, have the user provision, yeah, to expand the business. And then the third quarter would be focused on business development as well. And we will launch the new version to have more tools, more support, and have more in house models people can use instantly without paying extra costs. And the last quarter, we will target 100 enterprise in a platform with 500k Arr, in 2028 overall would be five to 10% of the target market, which is from 100 million to $200 million and we will expand the market to global market. For now, we must focus on in the US market. About our team, I mentioned Jason has probably experienced in software development and AI, he done the project for Dubai government. Before joining with getting AI. We have met each other eight years ago when we work at the same company, your network, and then we start up again. We start up together with rest of network due to MCN and marketing agency,
Okay, so about our competitive advantage, we will specifically for enterprise business and we have core technology to make it faster, more cost effective and cost saving.

So we will reach our target 500k IRR at the end of this year, and we'll have 3000 users about our roadmap. We already done with the first quarter. We already launched our beta, and we are in the second quarter where we expand the business, monetize it, have the user provision, yeah, to expand the business. And then the third quarter would be focused on business development as well. And we will launch the new version to have more tools, more support, and have more in house models people can use instantly without paying extra costs. And the last quarter, we will target 100 enterprise in a platform with 500k Arr, in 2028 overall would be five to 10% of the target market, which is from 100 million to $200 million and we will expand the market to global market. For now, we must focus on in the US market. About our team, I mentioned Jason has probably experienced in software development and AI, he done the project for Dubai government. Before joining with getting AI. We have met each other eight years ago when we work at the same company, your network, and then we start up again. We start up together with rest of network due to MCN and marketing agency,
S Speaker 113:59after I left Vietnam and he studied abroad. We still work with each other in different projects in those eight years to outsource the development projects to your clients. Now, yeah, we start up again with ya tonight. Yeah, that would be our presentation. Thanks for listening

bit about our demo. Yeah,
bit about our demo. Yeah,
S Speaker 214:29yeah. Would love to look at the demo. It's certainly interesting space for us, but at the moment, it also feels like the check the round that you're raising is probably around earlier from where we play check sizes cannot go below $2 million so it might be around early. But happy to look at the demo and make a few introductions for you, if you would like
yeah. Would love to look at the demo.

S Speaker 114:53sure we also can raise up to 1 million. But the idea would be for safe, not.

S Speaker 215:00Yeah, no, I get that, but from a traction perspective as well, when I say a check size of 210, thinking more from a company, which is seed to series A so from a traction perspective as well, it is slightly early, but again, happy to have this connection going and down the line, maybe for the next round we can
Yeah, no, I get that, but from a traction perspective as well, when I say a check size of 210, thinking more from a company, which is seed to series A so from a traction perspective as well, it is slightly early, but again, happy to have this connection going and down the line, maybe for the next round we can

Yes, good. Appreciate that.
S Speaker 115:33Yes. You can see my screen right? Yeah, yeah. So this is the dashboard after the login. They will see the personal flow and team collaboration dashboard here, flow and components will be here. And when they want to create a new card, new flow, they click on this button, they will see all the templates we already built from for them. They can start with any of them, or they can create a blank flow to start from scratch
Yes. You can see my screen right? Yeah, yeah. So this is the dashboard after the login. They will see the personal flow and team collaboration dashboard here, flow and components will be here.

S Speaker 216:03and Caitlin, what kind of one second just on the templates? What kind of templates do you have to what extent can you call functions today? What all tools have you built in already?
and Caitlin, what kind of one second just on the templates? What kind of templates do you have to what extent can you call functions today? What all tools have you built in already?

S Speaker 116:18Yeah, I will show you those templates later. So here, when they create a blank flow, they mostly will use the menu on the left hand side to start building the A agents. They will drag and drop the jet input output, and then choose model, for example, what? Here we have so many models, but I will start with something like Google, and just simply drag and drop and connect all the components together, and then put in the API key. I Right?
Yeah, I will show you those templates later. So here, when they create a blank flow, they mostly will use the menu on the left hand side to start building the A agents.

S Speaker 117:06Yes, and it can be test in the blank browser, which went well after that, you can publish to the API. At here we have instant API, so just need to copy and input into platform. And yeah, they will have the quick single agents like this about the platform, about a template that you pass. Yeah, we have different agents here to them to start with. For example, data, round table, data to message, PDF, memory, jackpot, email, lawyer, Jack bot asked AI, website, multi type agent, YouTube, analyze research data and travel. Make many different right based on what they need. They can start with, and we make make more over time. So when we have the marketplace, there's more templates that people can use. And let me show a simple one or more complex one. Let's say,
Yes, and it can be test in the blank browser, which went well after that, you can publish to the API. At here we have instant API, so just need to copy and input into platform.

Yeah, complex one would be better. I would say, Okay,
Yeah, complex one would be better. I would say, Okay,
S Speaker 118:25I think I have one here. Yeah, this is the more complex one. So it's with many agents here, and then land flow, yeah, to have more complex test, so it will
I think I have one here. Yeah, this is the more complex one. So it's with many agents here, and then land flow, yeah, to have more complex test, so it will
