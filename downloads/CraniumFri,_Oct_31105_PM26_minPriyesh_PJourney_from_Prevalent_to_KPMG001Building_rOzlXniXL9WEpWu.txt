2:11me. And this was when, when Jonathan, when was this?

me. And this was when, when Jonathan, when was this?
S Speaker 12:17and 20. Okay, okay. And then I pitched the firm on the idea of building cranium, yes. So the way that that worked was I got an offer to go run another software business, and I said to the firm, I'm like, I'm leaving. But in the interim, my business started throwing off. We were the second or third most profitable business in cyber Yeah. And so I they're like, We don't want you to leave. What does it take to stay and so I put a pitch deck together over a weekend. They said, pitch us. What I didn't know was they had set up an incubator called KPMG studio. I had no idea. And I said, you know, if you give me $3 million I'll start building product, see if this is feasible. I want to build my own team, and it's going to be only software and AI. And if you do this, I want to spin the business out, and I want to keep the majority of it now. I don't know if you ever worked at the Big Four. I thought there, you know, I thought there was zero likelihood they were going to say, however, the head of advisory $10 billion global business this guy ran, give me $3 million in three days, and said, You're staying. I basically paid for it anyway, because my business was throwing off the cash. Yeah, but you're staying. And we got started, and then we spun the business out in 2023 sim ventures, if you know those guys. So this is Jay leak. He was the former CISO at Blackstone, and he, he founded a fund called clear sky, and then then sin ventures, and then they did our a rap, they did our seed plus with KPMG, and then Telstra ventures did our A, and we're going into the B. So the business has been going great. Yeah, we're in our third selling year. We did a million dollars our first selling year. We did 2 million in our second and we've already done 4,000,006 months into our fiscal year this year. So we've doubled up. We want to get to five for the annual but we're going to raise that forecast in December to eight to 10. So we have an opportunity potentially go 5x this year, which is really exciting. I saw that happen at prevalent and it just, you know, in this market, we're, you know, our customers are like, JPMC, we just closed AT and T we have Telstra, we have j and Jr, and then we have their vendors. So I'll show you how we think about the platform. But, you know, it's been a wild ride.

S Speaker 24:42Absolutely, John, that's That's amazing. Those numbers in such a short period of time are not easy. And some of the logos that you mentioned, the highly enterprise clients, you cannot sell a half cooked product to them. So congrats on all of the successes so far. That sounds really incredible.

S Speaker 14:59And we have no services. So people here KPMG, they're like, is it a service business? We this has been like, the issue since the very beginning. This is like, so frustrating to me, because all of what I'm talking about is Arr, we don't do any services, yes, so we actually work with a lot of partners. So we have KPMG, we've got HGS, we've got uni case, we've got Protiviti. We just, we didn't deal with at&t with each that was our biggest deal ever. We did a 1.1 million ARR deal a year. So it's 2.2 over two years, TCV, and then we did that with WWT

S Speaker 25:37John, that's That's amazing. So I'd love to spend a little bit time on the product. I think we understand that. So understand the product in these spaces, so we can go a little bit technical, and then in the end, spend some time on the GTM. Sounds like you have amazing clients who would love to understand a little bit of use cases on that side. But John, before that, you also mentioned as around your Are you actively raising Series B? Is that coming sometime around?

S Speaker 16:06Yeah, we're ahead on cash. We're ahead on the number. So I, I kind of pushed the fundraising off from the fall until January. Okay, and I kind of want to get to five. I want to get to the annual number by the end of November, seven months in, and then be able to basically fundraise off of that strength. Totally, yeah. So we've already had an, effectively an offer to put 100 million in at a 400 million pre but I told them, like, hold on, like, I'm I'm not interested in taking that right now, because I need to, you know, I need to get into December. I need to do my options, make sure we're not repricing everybody out in that board December board meeting, and then probably start opening up the fundraising in January.

S Speaker 27:02Absolutely. And it makes sense, if you can go from the five that you have to 10, that could be an incredible milestone to raise a pretty strong ground so I get what you're thinking of,
Absolutely. And it makes sense, if you can go from the five that you have to 10, that could be an incredible milestone to raise a pretty strong ground so I get what you're thinking of,

Absolutely. And it makes sense, if you can go from the five that you have to 10, that could be an incredible milestone to raise a pretty strong ground so I get what you're thinking of,
S Speaker 17:13yeah, and we have about 32 million in pipeline. So, like, we really have a lot enough pipeline in the back end of the year, in the next six months. To, you know, we could go above that, but I'm trying to make it reasonable. Like, if we already have eyes on eight to 10, like, we're, you know, we're already double the size of the business in six months. Like, let's get to the five. Let's get the annual number as soon as possible. And then, you know, people have a lot of faith that we'll get,
yeah, and we have about 32 million in pipeline. So, like, we really have a lot enough pipeline in the back end of the year, in the next six months.

yeah, to, you know, absolutely, absolutely, John,
yeah, to, you know, absolutely, absolutely, John,
yeah, to, you know, absolutely, absolutely, John,
S Speaker 17:44so, so the way I think about the business is, you know, we only work in the largest enterprises and their vendors. So we made a decision on our architecture pretty early on, that we were not going to be an AI firewall. So we started building originally to try to sit in line, maybe. But AI has been changing so frequently, and the development of the AI infrastructure and agentic infrastructure, in many cases, doesn't even exist. It exists in the business. It doesn't exist centrally. And the cyber teams that we worked with had no visibility into it. They weren't even part of the conversation. So what we needed to do was we needed to be able to connect to the systems where that development was happening, be able to understand the composition of a system. But instead of trying to put something in the middle of that, our intention was, let's, let's understand. So we built something called detect AI. We did that with J and J, for those guys, scan about 110,000 repos. We identify about 4000 AI systems. And what we do, we take our detect AI and it does a very broad, very shallow scan to understand where ml and Gen AI is integrated into their software, their capable, their products and their and their software capabilities, right? We then use code sensor to go deeper. And what that does is it does a composition analysis. It looks for the models, toolkits, data sets, infrastructure.
so, so the way I think about the business is, you know, we only work in the largest enterprises and their vendors.

S Speaker 29:17Very sorry, Jonathan for breaking your flow. But very quick question on detect AI, does this sort of tie in as an API, SDK, to the applications that say a J and J is building, or does this tie in into the network proxies, and you are able to even look at all the third party usage?

S Speaker 19:34We basically plug into the develop the VCs environment. So we'll plug into GitHub, Bitbucket, Git labs Azure, DevOps. So our goal is to understand in the experiment, even as early in the experimentation process as possible, like, what is getting built, where is it, and then pre production, and then post, like into production, we still can understand. So we have code sensor for that and detect, and then we have agent sensor and cloud sensor to go deeper into the infrastructure. So we started with Microsoft, and JPMC is one of our clients, and on their behalf, we started building cloud sensor. And an agent sensor allows us to look at where the autonomous agentic mechanism not MCP, but where the agent is driving autonomy, and where the connections to those other tools are happening so that we can give the same level of visibility. But the big differentiator for us is we take that AI bond, and instead of trying to sit in line, we put it in. We actually build a simulation of that system. Okay? So we have our like where it comes into our infrastructure is we look at the system. Composition will stand up. The models will stand up, the toolkits will stand up. The infrastructure, if there's guardrails, we want to test that all gets done in our arena. And because of the nature of how, like of AI, you know, there's a really, it's very generalizable. So if we find, using our adversarial testing, if we find that there's a vulnerability inside of this arena in the simulation, there's a 95% chance it will work in your environment. So we get a lot of lift out of the fact that we can basically tell you the threats and risks without changing any of your development environment, without changing any of your architectures, and we can give you scale. So like at&t, after we got through their security process, yeah, two weeks to scan the entirety, entirety of their enterprise and get integrated. So we just get this massive scale for j&j just to plug on to that. We got 4000 AI systems. We create 4000 bombs. There's about 5000 models, those going, those go get tested in the arena with those systems, and then we give the vulnerability reporting. They had stood they had stood up six people to go do the identification of where that AI and what those systems look like manually in their GRC, the first time they push the button, they estimate that we saved them a million

So we have our like where it comes into our infrastructure is we look at the system. Composition will stand up. The models will stand up, the toolkits will stand up. The infrastructure, if there's guardrails, we want to test that all gets done in our arena. And because of the nature of how, like of AI, you know, there's a really, it's very generalizable. So if we find, using our adversarial testing, if we find that there's a vulnerability inside of this arena in the simulation, there's a 95% chance it will work in your environment. So we get a lot of lift out of the fact that we can basically tell you the threats and risks without changing any of your development environment, without changing any of your architectures, and we can give you scale. So like at&t, after we got through their security process, yeah, two weeks to scan the entirety, entirety of their enterprise and get integrated. So we just get this massive scale for j&j just to plug on to that. We got 4000 AI systems. We create 4000 bombs. There's about 5000 models, those going, those go get tested in the arena with those systems, and then we give the vulnerability reporting. They had stood they had stood up six people to go do the identification of where that AI and what those systems look like manually in their GRC, the first time they push the button, they estimate that we saved them a million
We basically plug into the develop the VCs environment. So we'll plug into GitHub, Bitbucket, Git labs Azure, DevOps. So our goal is to understand in the experiment, even as early in the experimentation process as possible, like, what is getting built, where is it, and then pre production, and then post, like into production, we still can understand. So we have code sensor for that and detect, and then we have agent sensor and cloud sensor to go deeper into the infrastructure. So we started with Microsoft, and JPMC is one of our clients, and on their behalf, we started building cloud sensor. And an agent sensor allows us to look at where the autonomous agentic mechanism not MCP, but where the agent is driving autonomy, and where the connections to those other tools are happening so that we can give the same level of visibility.

S Speaker 112:11Yeah, these are a combination this will get into, like the third party story, but these are all either software products that are getting developed and used in the in the like being sold. So, you know, J and J is an example. We work across Med, tech, clinical those are all products that are being developed and sold or or in the service and provision of product were used, were used internally in their corporate rag environment, as an example, got it. So the other, the other side of this is, you know, our arena shield, then takes that information, takes the so let's call arena our red teaming. Effectively, we automate red teaming in the shield. What we do is we take the use case of the system, we take the vulnerabilities that we just identified, we take the model information, and then we actually take the guardrails and test them, both the commercial and the open source ones. We can give you an understanding of what the best composition looks like, or if you're already using a guardrail, we can give you the risk, and then any any inherent risk there that we identify, we can actually give you Blue Team code. Call it our own guardrail support. And if it's a chat environment, we'll give you, let you download, like, a YAML file, push that all the way through the CICD, and we can actually show you what the reduction is. So if there's, like, you're 80% susceptible to this particular type of risk, yeah, we can look, we can tell you what it would look like if you implemented this, this card, right? Got it. Got it. So that comes in. So because we've got that architecture, you know, it worked really, really well for third party. So JPMC is our largest banking customer, and they actually use this exact same architecture to stand up tenants of cranium, for any of their technology providers that are bringing AI applications into the bank and amazingly, like, This is crazy. Amazingly, we thought like 10 to 20% would would plug in code sensor. We're finding upwards of 70% of the vendors are willing to use code sensor because it's making it faster for them to sell AI to the
Yeah, these are a combination this will get into, like the third party story, but these are all either software products that are getting developed and used in the in the like being sold.

Generally, if we have to go through their security process, then that takes longer. We can enumerate the AI bomb and provide the compliance reporting and the vulnerability reporting. We get that back to the bank in less than a week, and they're able to meet those obligations on a on a monthly basis instead of an annual basis.

S Speaker 214:48John, super interesting, and I love the comprehensiveness of the platform. Maybe a question again, on the Discover side of the module, what happens to or do you touch or not touch any third party, unauthorized AI that is being accessed by, say, an employee at a JPMC, employee swiping their own credit card using an application, would you go into same level of, say, security for some of those applications? Yeah.

S Speaker 115:18I mean, we have some partners that do that, like a partner, like, we're starting to build a partnership with, like Cisco. Like, I think that use case is really more aligned to somebody who has a web application type of approach, yeah, where they have a gateway and a WAF that sits and looks at traffic as it transmits across the network, yes, but you have to have that infrastructure in place. Like, no startup right now. Like, there's this company called witness AI, like, they're building some stuff for DLP right which is really, really important, but they require you to change your gateway architectures to do the DLP pickup. And we're seeing like people aren't willing to do it, or they're not all that traffic isn't traversing that single gateway. I think people like Cisco Z scaler, maybe checkpoint, depending on who runs that, are in a much better position to pick that up for us, that we become the beneficiary of that data. So like we're running a use case down with Cisco right now, and with Akamai, frankly, with ATT where, because we see, they see those Gen AI applications going across the WAF, we basically can identify them. We identify what, who the vendors of those applications are, and then we can provide them with cranium. If they don't use cranium, they can't they get shut down.

That's interesting. These are some interesting data points. Okay, okay,
S Speaker 120:05Me see if it's in here. Yeah. So like, by the end of our fiscal year, we're going to have 400 plot 50 tenants across our ecosystem. And this is a combination of our enterprise customers are, we built a trust hub for VISTA equity. I don't know if you know them, but for their portfolio. So exactly was the first one there. We're picking up another 10 next quarter, and there's probably 40 to 50 in total. But basically, if you're a portfolio company and you integrate AI in your product, which you're forced to do, we've already trained 200 of their folks across the portfolio, so we pick those up, and we're starting to see our first conversions of the vendors who have this artifact now and then want to use it more broadly. So we expect to onboard about 500 tenants. We're going to have this like ecosystem, and we're going to start to convert. We've already contracted for next year. We already contracted close to 2000

S Speaker 221:05Oh, that's interesting. And Jonathan, so who do you come across as competitors in the market? I would assume it's not the likes of witness AI or a scrape, those guys. Do you see the hidden layers, fiddler, Galileo, more as your direct competitors in the market? And do you ever come across them?
Oh, that's interesting. And Jonathan, so who do you come across as competitors in the market? I would assume it's not the likes of witness AI or a scrape, those guys. Do you see the hidden layers, fiddler, Galileo, more as your direct competitors in the market? And do you ever come across them?

S Speaker 121:21Across them? I would say protect AI was our primary competitor, be honest, yeah, but I don't think we compete with Palo. I think the reality is that, like a lot of these companies that have been picked up and picked up for their talent, yeah, those that had been building like, let's say AI firewalls are just guardrail solutions. So you know whether that be like Kara or even robust intelligence with Cisco. Like, yeah, those are great partnerships for us, because we can test those guardrails before customers implement them, and we can tell you how effective they're going to be in our simulation. Got it. I mean, in some ways, you could argue we compete there too, if you don't want to do that. But why wouldn't you want to do that? Because we can test the effectiveness of Nemo versus era versus Cisco AI defense. So, I mean, I don't know. I there, we definitely have competitors. I would have said protect was our primary, but I'm not so sure that's going to be the same moving forward. I think hidden layer is interesting from a competitive perspective, but they

S Speaker 222:27Yes, the model security side, they're very comprehensive there, but they don't take a platform approach for sure. Jonathan, what's your what's your end goal here, just some of these players that you mentioned had absolutely no revenue compared, like, relatively speaking, very, very, less, less than 300k you wouldn't really call that revenue today, but they were taken

S Speaker 222:53Yeah, and your traction is pretty, pretty strong. So are you sort of down the line, looking towards an acquisition or just going public. How do you see this shaping up?

S Speaker 124:58So here's what I will tell you, yeah, things that move me, I got preempted in the A I wasn't even fundraising. Yeah, things that move me and I, again, we have a potential opportunity on the table. As I told you, somebody wants to give us $100 million on 400 I'm not sure that's how much what I want to do yet, but if you want to preempt us, I would, I would, I would be open to those conversations. Yeah, I hate fundraising. Yeah, if you want to come with a partner and do it, I like, Qualcomm a lot. Like, you guys are great company. You're one of the leaders. So, like, I'm open to any of that. Like, that's how it happened with Telstra, they came in, they gave me a term sheet. They said, let's go. Like, it was very easy for me.
So here's what I will tell you, yeah, things that move me, I got preempted in the A I wasn't even fundraising. Yeah, things that move me and I, again, we have a potential opportunity on the table.

S Speaker 225:40That sounds good, Jonathan, our check sizes will not allow us to become a lead check for this round. I don't think we'll. We haven't done a round more than 15 so far, so that may be slightly difficult, but let me have a chat with the team also. Jonathan, would you be open to set up another call? This is pretty interesting. I'd love for Deepak to also take a look we have together, spoken to more than 20 companies in this space. So okay, so let me get back to you on that as well. I'd love to schedule something up for the next week or the week after that, whenever your schedule allows for it.
