S Speaker 10:00Does that work? Okay? Well, thanks everyone. I think it's been a really interesting morning. I'll sort of introduce myself and then introduce our panelists as well. So I Bray foster Clinton, I'm one of the San Francisco correspondential times, smattering of companies, base center providers, through to autonomous vehicle companies, and also look at the sort of commercial applications of robotics. And so I'm happy to sort of introduce our two panelists. So we've got moda allowing the founder of this summit. Moda is a free time founder. He's made the leap from working on technology for the automotive sector, and as of this morning, you've heard He's also getting involved in venture cap with am ventures that's included establishing $100 million pre seed and seed fund focusing on robotics, that some of those investments are on the agenda, from micro factor to weave and others on stage. So Apple is also working with James wells to executive century AI. So James has been sort of working. His team have been working on developing robotic systems and software used to create general purpose robots. Sanctuary was founded in 2018 it's based in Vancouver, and James priyeshy worked on as clean tech investor companies. I'll turn over to James first, because I think he has a couple of slides and we'll dive into some questions.

S Speaker 24:58actually started off like a category leader, and then, boy, we saw just a wave of innovation come out of China. I think at one point, you know, there's 100 plus humanoid groups out there, and you know, we as a company haven't benefited, and so what it's forced us to do is really focus on what the customer cares about. So our focus now is actually building performing policies in a way that's very efficient. So what we're finding, not to get to into the weeds, is that the fine tuning process, or the task specific data, is the most contributory towards a performance policy. And so we're spending an awful lot of time at customer sites, building highly performing policies that we think customers are going to adopt, and it's a bit orthogonal to the generalization approach. I mean, if you think about generalization or performance, those two vectors are essentially at war. And you know, we're trying to be very pragmatic and accelerate customer adoption by focusing on performance first.

S Speaker 17:03I think James mentioned sort of race another way. I think you've seen it with language models. Talk about the Cold War a lot in the context of AI models between the US and China. I mean, where do you feel like the US currently has an edge when you're looking at companies that you want to invest in? Where do you feel like there might be weaknesses or lagging players?

S Speaker 37:30I think the landscape today is China leads in hardware. 80 90% of preferred minerals come from China. Is a tremendous execution in manufacturing automation. I think the US leads in the brain so far. Still, there's a lot of competition. China is catching up. But I do believe it's, you know, depending on the use cases, it's kind of neck to neck. One of our portfolio companies is in China, Norwegian agnostic. I think I mentioned that earlier. Another one is in France. And wherever we see opportunity, we're just going to go the industry is too small. We're still building the ecosystem. There isn't hundreds of 1000s of companies racing towards this. So wherever we see there's opportunity to collaborate, connect founders and the industry. We will, we will, we will invest. But I. I have to say hardware will become commoditized more and more,

S Speaker 18:54I mean, I wonder you've spoken about building an ecosystem, starting off with the summit, started your fund, and started building up to this more collective offering, more comprehensive offering. Talk a bit more about that ecosystem and what you want to see directionally, particularly on behalf of some of the work that you're doing.

S Speaker 39:17I think robotics is has been transformational historically, but but AI has been just as transformational, and so this kind of marriage of AI and robotics is just incredible. I truly believe it will change every single industry as we know it, whether it's consumer, they say or not, for the next decade. I'm fairly convinced we double down on the ecosystem the humanoid form factor, particularly spatial intelligence, or spatial AI, a new form of intelligence beyond foundation models, or the evolution of foundation models. I think we have a panel about that later today. And the ecosystem in general, we're bullish on data. We're not going to get there without Tera autonomy will not get there without tell ya. Atomo is one of our portfolio companies. I think they're here in the audience. Amazing company. They're trying to build whatever scale AI did for the autonomous vehicle industry with teleop data, etc. It's a tremendous amount of opportunity. I mean, for a lot of people, they, you know, fund the one is $100 million hardware is capital intensive. We do plan to invest somewhere between 35 and 40 startups over the life of the fund, but and that's just that seed and we're. Received, quite honestly, if, if, if we had multiple funds at a billion dollars each, we would still invest, and there will still be a ton of opportunity.

S Speaker 110:57And well, James, I think one of your sort of perspectives here is that we've heard a lot from generalist model makers this morning, but you feel that actually, I mean, the value proc for sanctuary is your focus on very specific tasks with high sort of degree of certainty. I just wonder. I mean, as those generalist models evolve and they become more accurate, and they reach that degree of accuracy, and what does that mean for companies like factory, how do you sort of build and protect loads around yourselves?

S Speaker 211:28Yeah, there's a question around timing there, right? So what we built is almost like an AI model generator. So we generate very high performing task specific models. And what we're finding is you can do this with data volumes below 20 to 30 hours. And you know, I spend so much time with the industrial operators and the customers out there, and they don't really care about

S Speaker 211:57Of the models they care about, you actually doing specific tasks, and I'm talking about specifically manufacturers. So the focus is, we can we build reliable, robust models that allow these manufacturers to meet their ROI? And, you know, we're just starting to see evidence. We've done a number of trials this year at customer sites, where we're getting close to that threshold.

S Speaker 112:21And Moto, when you sort of think about James's perspective here, when you think about going to 2026 you've got a number of generous players in the market. You're investing in a number of other providers, whether they're providing teleops, datas, and as you sort of mentioned, similar to what scale AI we're doing with sort of tagging you. And when have you seen great strides? I mean, do you feel like the generalist can catch up, that they can be much more competitive against someone who's more specific and focused on dedicated tasks? I mean, what does the ecosystem look like? Go into 2026

S Speaker 312:59it's two different exclusive thoughts. Some people, you know, go after generalist model, and some want to tackle certain problems and real world examples and real world problems for customers that are willing to pay today, I like the longer term view of generalist kind of intelligence. And, of course, the form factor to go. There with the data, I'm bullish on that there's four or five companies doing exactly the same, probably going after different verticals, whether it's a warehousing only, versus manufacturing versus the home, etc. The Holy Grail is general, you know, general robotics, general capability. It doesn't mean you can't start with specific tasks, but, but you know, I would, I. Kind of biased towards both both foods across and which is the reason why we like to invest across the board.

S Speaker 114:04And then the final one for me, I think obviously that a large part of our coverage has been focusing on investigative around large language models. How much is being spent on business infrastructure? On the actual sort of fundamentally or the installments, how does that?

You got to figure out the safety systems, the reliability, the service program, how you integrate, how you interface with all the warehouse software.

S Speaker 315:50I'd say data, obviously, if you talk about software or hardware, is going to become commoditized. Sensors are going to become cheaper. Sensor fusion is going to become effective. The use cases depend on the data. We're talking about, supervised learning, not so much, semi supervised or weekly. Supervised or self supervised. So we're still talking about genea is still supervised learning. It does require data that has to be accurate. It has to represent the environment in which the actual humidity needs to be deployed in. So data play is data is a big play. Execution, obviously, is everything. Access to rare data, thematic, rare, one of our portfolios, they have hospital pharmacies. Data is very. Very niche, not easy for anyone to get something, to have a presentation tomorrow. So that's, that's, that's, that's a foundational mode for most companies, unless they are building hardware only, which isn't probably sustainably by point

S Speaker 318:45So a lot of it has to do with sort of dexterity, right? It's the last runs here. We do have a panel later today. Jeremy was on it. Dexterity is, you know, there was a Wall Street Journal article that just came out three weeks ago or so that says the hand problem, which is exactly the title of the fireside chat. Mixed area is a problem. It leverages hardware and software, but also data, but also data. We. Um, so it is the last frontier, and it's going to be problem for a while, but there will be different types of dexterity tasks. There will be tasks that can perform at their best only using soft robotics or a hybrid but I do, I do agree with James and I understand his point of view. They started investing in this early on. One of their moats also is haptic feedback. I don't even have any information about the touch the. On the note, okay, okay, but I do believe that I agree. So dexterity is the last frontier. Maybe a year, year and a half ago, locomotion was it solved. The folks from expand are here in a conference today or tomorrow. They perfected the catwalk. So locomotion is a solved problem when you see that video or you see the actual hiring. Which could make it through customs. We were hoping to have iron here on stage. But when you see that demo, whether it's video or real life, you will realize how locomotion has been solved, period.

S Speaker 421:21I have a question because you wanted to mention both data and dexterity. But what are your viewpoints on power? Like, it's a big problem also in the EV market, like, just the actual power to sustain these robots in a valuable work a day, for example, is a bit hard because now you're adding more kilograms and loads and all that stuff to it and reducing the amount that it. Actually pick up from that. So what's your perspective on that in

S Speaker 221:46the future? Yeah, I think for mobile robots, it's certainly a challenge getting the power density increase. For batteries, it's obviously going to extend the lifetime of the robots. That's still an issue. Like a lot of things we're looking for are tethered or stationary, and so I don't think it's, you know, going to shift the base load of the power. But I think for once, you want mobile robots, certainly leaving an interior of a building or going outside, you know, we're going to have to see some some gains, and you. Innovation for battery just if you want to see that like eight hour workday. And the reason I say an eight hour workday is because that is how these adopters are thinking about paybacks

S Speaker 222:58No, it's not a function of that. So there's this great article by Rodney Brooks about a month ago that said you can't just use vision. So if you think about it, you need interactivity in the data to build an interactive model with an object. And so the thing that's lacking is force feedback. So you really need a way to transmit the force from the robot to the tele operator. And, you know, a sanctuary where we're uniquely building hydrology based hand we can actually measure the pressure in the fluid line that translates to the force with the corresponds with the vision data. So we're currently generating highly. The haptically enabled data with force feedback, with vision as a baseline to start training these more foundational models for hands. But I don't see how you do that with electromechanical or cable based hands, so it's unclear whether we're kind of unique in the world to do that, but I think everyone's really thinking hard how to get force feedback

S Speaker 226:11In China, I guess who you're comparing against. Again, the McKinsey slide was great that only 6% of factories in US are fully Yeah, I went to China. He won this year and toured maybe three or four different companies. It's just incredible, the rate and pace that they're investing in the space. You got to remember that like they're the manufacturing country the last decade, so they have a huge advantage the. The work ethic there. They do this 996, you know, for six days a week, and, and, and just, you know, they got policies to to support all of this industrial advancement. And I, you know, the world is going to outsource manufacturing to China for a long time. So I think that's kind of the history there. We're from Canada, so slightly different, but we still have a huge issue in Canada, because Canada's. Labor productivity growth rate is the worst out of all OCED countries. And so Canada, we're going to pull up our booths and really start driving labor productivity.

And I think a composition is only really sort of intensifying, particularly between sort of Western players and China. I think the next year is going to be sort of, well, at least for us, a really interesting one in terms of coverage. So thank you both. If we could give them a round of applause. And I think I
