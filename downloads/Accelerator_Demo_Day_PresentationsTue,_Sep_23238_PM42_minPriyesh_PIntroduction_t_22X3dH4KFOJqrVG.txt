S Speaker 10:00People really all the cool stuff that's happening with our portfolio, back to the pitches. And then two years of the way through, become very embarrassed. You're absolutely going to look at my guarantee. And then we meet the startups at the Expo. Do not leave until you mail it down or something. Okay, let's jump in those of you first demo day. How many? How many scattered accommodate number? Oh, welcome. Welcome to scat accelerator. Where are you? You are easy for me to start a accelerator. We are so proud to be a part of this incredible institution. We are here for the dual mission, to be the world's top accelerator,

S Speaker 10:48to be the world's top accelerator, that's a Berkeley gallery, not just to be good, but to be the best. Our second mission, equally important, is to support UC Berkeley's publication, public education mission. I think you can all know right now, it's more important than ever to be focused on this incredible mission for this incredible university, and we're proud than ever to bring incredible founders here to solve the world's greatest problems. That's what we do. That's what we do at Berkeley, and that's what we're doing today. So a little overview of batch 20. There's some photos of them. You're going to meet them all in a minute. And you've heard us say before, you cannot really build a great community online. You can ask some nice zooms, and you do want to zoom sometimes when you don't want to drive up from the south bay? How many of you drove up from the south bay? Thank you. Thank you. That is not a small thing. Thank you for joining us here. I also want to welcome those of us who are watching us on the video, which will be released tomorrow. Thank you for joining us online, between this in person and the folks online, biggest nominated Bay Area with that question, largest nominated so that's where the area is. Is nobody, so that's where we are today. So that's 20. As you know, they're not just Berkeley. They're from around the world. Berkeley is important. Lots of things, a better personality. And what we've really noticed about those batches is how difficult they are. They listen. They're taking it all in, and they're adjusting very, very rapidly. Just the pitch practice for today is an extraordinary journey for them that is such an important skill because of what's going on in the world today, right? If you're not keeping up every day, you're falling behind. And we've noticed that this incredibly high integrity for learning and dispatch has been great. And those are just some scenes of what we can all do together. So I just wanted to say I just got back from one of our greatest partners, government, yesterday, Expo in

S Speaker 312:51week over week. We are looking at the paid users of Google workspace and Microsoft output that are driving to work. There's over 100 million of them, if we charge them $360 a year, which is like $1 a day. We are looking at a $36 billion opportunity. We're initially focused on investors, founders, heads of sales, marketing and engineering, basically the busy professionals for whom 30 minutes back is very precious. We're looking to get a 6500 users of this architect in the next 12 months. Charge them $30 a month, and get 200,000 NMR, we are already live with Google workspace. We're integrating with Slack outlook and LinkedIn to facilitate this. April will win. We are building a world of intelligence data of how busy execs interact with their workplace tools, and we have a personalized memory craft of who is important in a business person's daily life. This keeps getting stronger and stronger over time, making April irreplaceable. We are raising 2.3 million to get to series, a to hit 2.5 million in annual recurring revenue in the next 12 months, and continue to grow 30% month over month. Come join us as we make city a distant memory. Thank you.

S Speaker 417:03We're starting with a seven and a half billion dollar market across the US energy, oil and gas and utility sectors, where there are over 500,000 reported compliant inspections annually. Drover is built to deliver full asset coverage along with autonomy that removes the operational limits of holding the industry back. Combining this with our review and insights platform provides a true end to end solution for our customers problems, and we built the first drover in just three months, and we've demoed our technology to Chevron PG and other major US utilities, and now we're finalizing our first paid trial agreements with PGD and accurate with a total identified pipeline of over $5 million in ARR for the next two years. And so we're raising a $3 million round to deliver on these upcoming trials. Scale our employments to meet the demand we have identified, and we have secured elite investor for over half our run, and over half our brown is committed already. So if you would like to join this robotics industrial revolution, we'd love to meet you and let me be drove at our booth afterwards. Thank you.

S Speaker 518:39I'm CEO of flexify.ai. Global trade today. Is a tipping point, rapidly changing tariff policies on johting and Taiwan, even a single policy shift can ripple across countries. Hot production, from your morning coffee to semiconductors to airplanes, tariffs are causing caves. But here is the real killer, the hidden cost. Trade volumes have gone up 7x over the last 10 years, yet the compliance workforce that actually handles it has stayed flat. The cost companies are bleeding billions in overpayments, misclassifications and lost sales. Here's one such a client manager I'd like to meet Sarah. She is just one out of two people at a billion dollar OEM on the book to clear a 4000 part shipment. She does this by coming through 1000s and 1000s of pages of status quo. Just keep production movies a single digit misclassification on this 10 digit code means a 2 million Spain in UVs. That's the pressure Sarah actually has to live in. It's no wonder then. It takes 45 minutes per student throwing people at it doesn't really scale, and it's costly. Now let's imagine a different world instead, when policies shift, an ait made times in reasons like an expert and sensitive results back just in minutes that stack pro flexifies First, AI teammate built for trade. Now, compliance is as easy as email. Now is Sarah the superhuman working 100x faster at expert level accuracy our project a reasoning first, AI trade engine, fed with proprietary data but grounded with pure enterprises knowledge. In the last three months, we've classified 25,000 parts, earned phenomenal feedback from our customers. They can imagine they can't wait to use our own and have hundreds of requests per day. This urgency has translated into revenue for us. We booked $44,000 in revenue on track to close subscriptions to only $200,000 and have a healthy pipeline. We built this because we lived it. I come with 10 years of experience in supply chain. Ai six patterns and multiple industry transformations. Priesh is co author of Lama three and Lama four, and is an expert at least with mental health. We learn all roles because we believe this is the time to transform the future of work for supply chains. Legacy, systems cannot adapt to the volatility of today's trade and newcomers cannot adapt to complexity. Fletchy, unmatched accuracy for complex domain while being real time trade aware. We just launched our open source trade reasoning model that eats a lot of Frontier models like GPT five and Gemini 2.5

She is just one out of two people at a billion dollar OEM on the book to clear a 4000 part shipment. She does this by coming through 1000s and 1000s of pages of status quo. Just keep production movies a single digit misclassification on this 10 digit code means a 2 million Spain in UVs. That's the pressure Sarah actually has to live in. It's no wonder then. It takes 45 minutes per student throwing people at it doesn't really scale, and it's costly. Now let's imagine a different world instead, when policies shift, an ait made times in reasons like an expert and sensitive results back just in minutes that stack pro flexifies First, AI teammate built for trade. Now, compliance is as easy as email. Now is Sarah the superhuman working 100x faster at expert level accuracy our project a reasoning first, AI trade engine, fed with proprietary data but grounded with pure enterprises knowledge. In the last three months, we've classified 25,000 parts, earned phenomenal feedback from our customers. They can imagine they can't wait to use our own and have hundreds of requests per day. This urgency has translated into revenue for us. We booked $44,000 in revenue on track to close subscriptions to only $200,000 and have a healthy pipeline. We built this because we lived it. I come with 10 years of experience in supply chain. Ai six patterns and multiple industry transformations. Priesh is co author of Lama three and Lama four, and is an expert at least with mental health. We learn all roles because we believe this is the time to transform the future of work for supply chains. Legacy, systems cannot adapt to the volatility of today's trade and newcomers cannot adapt to complexity. Fletchy, unmatched accuracy for complex domain while being real time trade aware. We just launched our open source trade reasoning model that eats a lot of Frontier models like GPT five and Gemini 2.5
I'm CEO of flexify.ai. Global trade today. Is a tipping point, rapidly changing tariff policies on johting and Taiwan, even a single policy shift can ripple across countries. Hot production, from your morning coffee to semiconductors to airplanes, tariffs are causing caves. But here is the real killer, the hidden cost.

S Speaker 623:55That's because they're sending teams of experts to very remote locations. They're using explosives and bumper trucks and power hungry sensors. In the end, they're drilling into the subsurface to pull off samples in search of mineral ore. The mining industry is well aware of this huge problem, but their solutions are to do gravity surveys, which are low resolution, and they fail for many geologists, they tried seismic surveys, but they're extremely expensive and they have terrible deep resolution. Our solution instead uses a free energy source from space, exploded star, energy the Earth is constantly being showered by the special particle called a muon. We deploy our telescopes, and we watch these muons as they pass through the subsurface to generate 3d density maps, and we identify mineral deposits. Our solution is massively less expensive. It's much faster. Here, and we increase the probability of finding no Plaza in record time of less than six months. We finished building our first product, a muon motors. It is 10 times lower cost. It's higher resolution, and it works just about anywhere after we deploy our detector at our customer site, we can generate 3d density maps and locate mineral ore. This is deep tech, and to pull this off, we need an incredibly deep and diverse set of skills. I have been leading groups of PhDs to commercialize cutting edge technology related to AI and physics for more than 10 years. We've got this incredible team with expertise in AI, astrophysics, electrical engineering and mining, and we're advised by the world's foremost experts on muon tomography.

S Speaker 1037:49hi everyone. My name is Alton. I'm the CEO of Briscoe, and we're building the AI compliance layer for the construction and real estate industry, starting with the. Building permits. My parents are real estate developers in Brazil, and since I was a little kid, I've been hearing complaints about building permits, how slow and expensive the process is, and how one rejection can completely derail an entire project. Now in Brazil, we have a very creative and effective way to circumvent this problem. It's called a problem, and it works like a charm. Now in the United States, you might think that building permits are a solved problem, but if you've ever had to apply for one, you probably know that's not true at all. In fact, real estate developers and construction contractors take over six months to get a building permit, and they waste, every year almost $100 billion in carrying costs and also lost and a lot and they cannot rent out their properties. Now, why does it happen? Well, three out of four building permit applications are rejected in the first review cycle due to undetected code violations, inaccuracies across plans and mistakeness of middle packets, and that has huge implications for the US economy. There is a 5 million unit shortage in the US housing market that creates a gap of $1.5 trillion in US GDP due to reduced worker mobility. Result your scope solves this problem by detecting code violations and inaccuracies in plans before the application is submitted. We then correct errors in the states upstream in CAD and dim programmatically, and we handle all the back and forth with the city halls. We have built a computer vision and large image model pipeline that reads construction prints just like a human being does. It works as a data ingestion layer for. Construction Industry that extracts structured data from the blueprints, and then we wrote compliance checks against building and zoning codes that are starting our proprietary database with jurisdiction specific requirements, and we have over 1200 of them across the United States. Then 95% of the violations are displayed in a collaborative peer reviewed workspace where architects, engineers, contractors, subs and project owners get together to resolve these issues before it's too late. During inspections, and we have also Cody, which is our agency assistant that suggests and applies blank corrections on your behalf. By doing this, we reduce four correction cycles on. Bridge, which happened downstream in the municipalities, to just one before you submit the application. That brings. Is predictability and makes the process much, much faster every year, 1.5. 5 million building permit applications are submitted. Did at an average cost of $15,000. So we're talking about over $20 billion it's not this small. Market in retarded builders, chains and developers. Members who have a need for recurring projects the. Our competitors are primarily consultancies. That rely entirely on human labor, and as a result, are. Slow, expensive and cannot scale on the. Other hand, we have narrow solutions that are out of. Needed, but don't actually get the job done. They don't deliver faster permits. Years. We are at 40k ARR with the trip Pilot. Dollars with $12 million worth of projects in five. Point we are Stanley black diaper as an official. Distribution partner and we have processed over 120. So far, we haven't seen over 10 years. To experience in this vertical I started. My first company, which was a house flipping business. Business in Brazil at age 16, and so before I was 18, and. I did research for three years at think dance at UC Berkeley for. Just the golden School of Public Policy. My co founder had. Experience building scalable AI in ML pipelines and companies like scale AI. Agreement RnL lead has experiences in OCR to extract the. Different from documents and also led autonomous driving projects at gem. Us and our permit our operations lead, which we've hoped. From our competitor, permit flow has over 10 years of experience. Leading permitting projects in solar. At industrial projects so. We have the best team to. Fix this problem once and for all. All and we. Her back to buy a high.

hi everyone. My name is Alton. I'm the CEO of Briscoe, and we're building the AI compliance layer for the construction and real estate industry, starting with the. Building permits. My parents are real estate developers in Brazil, and since I was a little kid, I've been hearing complaints about building permits, how slow and expensive the process is, and how one rejection can completely derail an entire project. Now in Brazil, we have a very creative and effective way to circumvent this problem. It's called a problem, and it works like a charm. Now in the United States, you might think that building permits are a solved problem, but if you've ever had to apply for one, you probably know that's not true at all. In fact, real estate developers and construction contractors take over six months to get a building permit, and they waste, every year almost $100 billion in carrying costs and also lost and a lot and they cannot rent out their properties. Now, why does it happen? Well, three out of four building permit applications are rejected in the first review cycle due to undetected code violations, inaccuracies across plans and mistakeness of middle packets, and that has huge implications for the US economy. There is a 5 million unit shortage in the US housing market that creates a gap of $1.5 trillion in US GDP due to reduced worker mobility. Result your scope solves this problem by detecting code violations and inaccuracies in plans before the application is submitted. We then correct errors in the states upstream in CAD and dim programmatically, and we handle all the back and forth with the city halls. We have built a computer vision and large image model pipeline that reads construction prints just like a human being does. It works as a data ingestion layer for. Construction Industry that extracts structured data from the blueprints, and then we wrote compliance checks against building and zoning codes that are starting our proprietary database with jurisdiction specific requirements, and we have over 1200 of them across the United States. Then 95% of the violations are displayed in a collaborative peer reviewed workspace where architects, engineers, contractors, subs and project owners get together to resolve these issues before it's too late. During inspections, and we have also Cody, which is our agency assistant that suggests and applies blank corrections on your behalf. By doing this, we reduce four correction cycles on. Bridge, which happened downstream in the municipalities, to just one before you submit the application. That brings. Is predictability and makes the process much, much faster every year, 1.5. 5 million building permit applications are submitted. Did at an average cost of $15,000. So we're talking about over $20 billion it's not this small. Market in retarded builders, chains and developers. Members who have a need for recurring projects the. Our competitors are primarily consultancies. That rely entirely on human labor, and as a result, are. Slow, expensive and cannot scale on the. Other hand, we have narrow solutions that are out of.
