S Speaker 20:19So a brief intro. Nice to meet you. First brief intro for myself, CEO and co founder of similar and we do computer use agents, and have multiple partner lines, also open source research in there. And I know clearly because I met Ella in the Google accelerator a couple months back, and then we tried it. I actually post some videos on my LinkedIn as well in the past. Yeah, it's pretty interesting direction, and I feel it's gonna be pretty useful to most of the companies in Silicon Valley. So everyone now is doing advertisement, um, in social media, yeah.

S Speaker 21:19I started using two months ago, and start paying, I think, a month ago. And now they are they have more features now, so I just keep trying. I also try other products as well, but so far, like most of the other products, are not that effective. The UI is kind of hard to use, really, is kind of pretty simple to use. It's like, you just go there and do a few clicks and then get the video.

S Speaker 11:52So how frequently do generate videos with creative like once, twice a week, something like that. And is there an in house team or other videos made by human? And how much does creative take from those videos made by human?

S Speaker 22:11Oh, our company are pretty techy, so most of most of the people here are engineers, and normally I just make the video, we don't have a dedicated GTM person. So that's why I feel this, this kind of AI production, might be more effective, because most of the company I know here, they are kind of in the same situation, like, like, they don't want to hire, like, a dedicated person who just doing the video. So, yeah, instead you hire engineer, right? You are hiring engineer, you can be more productive on the product
Oh, our company are pretty techy, so most of most of the people here are engineers, and normally I just make the video, we don't have a dedicated GTM person.

2:49side. Yeah, gotcha. Yeah.
side. Yeah, gotcha. Yeah.
side. Yeah, gotcha. Yeah.
side. Yeah, gotcha. Yeah.
S Speaker 12:53So, so, so, so, how many videos do generate, like, daily or in the week, and how frequent you use this grade? Yeah.
So, so, so, so, how many videos do generate, like, daily or in the week, and how frequent you use this grade? Yeah.
So, so, so, so, how many videos do generate, like, daily or in the week, and how frequent you use this grade? Yeah.
So, so, so, so, how many videos do generate, like, daily or in the week, and how frequent you use this grade? Yeah.
S Speaker 23:02So for now, my purpose is more like trying to figure out a way to generate the videos. So in the beginning, is not that frequent. It's more like trying out different videos. But the same is, if we identify a good way to produce the videos, then I feel the most effective way is to generate maybe hundreds of 1000s of video like, again, in SEO. So some friends do, they do SEO, they do program, programmatic SEO, so they generate a lot of blog posts massively in their website, and yeah, and then that can drive a lot of traction. So I feel there might be something in the same way as video generation. But now if you ask a human to generate videos, kind of like takes a couple hours for one video, and you put it all in social media, and the max volume, the max volume for company a week, is probably, like, I don't know, like, seven videos a week, but, yeah, but if you, if you want to, I mean, the goal for us is not to generate a lot of videos, right? The goal is to test the GTM. Like, the messaging value prop, very prop, and what kind of content people like, right? So it's more like trying to find kind of like the product market for video content. Then if that's the case, the important part is to figure out a way to generate video in short amount of time, right? And channel one video short amount so every week we can publish maybe hundreds of videos, and look at the data, look at the data for each of the video and then figure out what's the right direction. I. For the next week. So I feel that's the most valuable part. Yeah, so that's something I have in mind. I feel there's no other way to do this without, you know, this kind of AI generation, video generation.

S Speaker 15:17So yeah, I believe that you have also used a lot of other video generation tools, especially considering that you are AI native coffee. So what other tools did you use? And how do you benchmark creative results against other tools? Yeah, I think,
So yeah, I believe that you have also used a lot of other video generation tools, especially considering that you are AI native coffee. So what other tools did you use? And how do you benchmark creative results against other tools? Yeah, I think,

S Speaker 25:39like industry standard is try vo three. We were in Google. Yeah, we know VO, we looked at like their quality is pretty good when I try to use it, but I feel it's still, you know, it's kind of like their model is too general, then it's good for I think that the current trend in AI is everyone cherry pick good videos. Even Google, they cherry pick good videos and put it in social media, and you feel like they're they can do everything. But the reality is their model is too general, so which is different from what, you know, the social media, advertisement, video format will be very different, yeah, and yeah and so that's one problem. There are some other company called icon, you know, the like, I want calm. What's the name? Icon? Icon, yeah, I see oh and okay. Icon.com, yeah, they are, they are pretty famous. They are kind of like, um.
like industry standard is try vo three. We were in Google.

6:58They keep saying they are founded by funders form,
They keep saying they are founded by funders form,
They keep saying they are founded by funders form,
They keep saying they are founded by funders form,
S Speaker 27:02yeah, everything they do is they just keep saying their money so they get famous. Um, yeah. But I feel it feels kind of weird, like, why not just show your videos and just keep saying you are the best? That's one in there. So we, I tried it. It's kind of like every step, it tries to get money out of me. So every step I try to ask me to charge the UI is not that great. I mean, they, they're not thinking in terms of, maybe they get a lot of money from farmers farm because they want to generate the revenue in short amount of time. So that actually hurt the user, hurt the user experience. Yeah, so I have to, like, I have to click on maybe 20 times. You generally don't wait a lot of Wait, like,
yeah, everything they do is they just keep saying their money so they get famous. Um, yeah. But I feel it feels kind of weird, like, why not just show your videos and just keep saying you are the best? That's one in there. So we, I tried it.

7:5630 minutes in there.
S Speaker 27:59Yeah, it's, it's more like they put more friction in there, which I feel critics did a very good job in there. The critic, I just log in there and do like, one or two clicks, and I can get a video out of that. Is this the same? Yeah, it's the same. You want something that can general video is minimal human effort, right? So, yeah, that can serve the purpose for scalable generations, yeah. But if you if every time I they are they have to ask me, like, do you want to pay more? Then someone needs to click on it and disable it. Won't be very effective. Yeah, also, it's kind of like the target customer for different parent tools. Is there their customer more or influencer social media, or maybe that's something else. And if that's not the case, then, in my effort, the consistency, like your General, General videos, which are not consistent every time it's different. Um, yeah, that could be a problem in there. And yeah, I think advertising is one area. And like launch videos, many startups here do launch videos. There are, like, hundreds of product launch every day. If you look at Product Hunt, right? Everyone wants to generate some good content. Because people talk about images. They do images as content. But you know, nowadays, everyone is doing videos. If we look at our traffic. The top traffic is coming on YouTube. It's all Instagram. So basically the conclusion is pretty clear, like, image will be automated, text will be automated. So in the end, everyone will generate videos for everything. So far I haven't seen on. Everyone doing that. But there's a trend, more and more video generation will be coming for startups like companies product launch videos. Normally it's like pretty short and it's not going to be like long video. And if they, if we go to like, professional producer, that can cost us, like 10, at least $10,000 for one video. Yeah, and if you use crazy, this kind of pools, that's like $50 per month. Yeah, it's like, it's a big, it's a pretty big difference,
Yeah, it's, it's more like they put more friction in there, which I feel critics did a very good job in there. The critic, I just log in there and do like, one or two clicks, and I can get a video out of that. Is this the same? Yeah, it's the same.

S Speaker 110:36yeah, so based on my understanding your the you of the advertisement or marketing use cases, all of your videos are generated by creative is it right?

S Speaker 210:51Oh, it's not all videos. It's like some videos are generated. We tested all different we're not all in in this just to be honest, but we have different tracks, right? So you sometimes we just record a video using our own phones. Yeah, some, some of the videos are generated by AI, and we don't have to generate everything by AI, because you want to maintain some diversity in your own content, right? Right? Yeah, yeah. It makes no sense. Yeah. It's hard for me to say, okay, everything is like, generated by AI, which doesn't make too much sense, because I, you know, I, I can just shoot a video right up to this meeting somewhere, right? We feel my phone is a

S Speaker 212:10mostly tool. We don't have many AI tools. Query is like one, one of that, yeah? So yeah, I would say 50% of those videos are AI. Oh, either, either AI generated or AI polished in there.

I'm probably on the most expensive plan already, yeah, and $70 not the big deal. Yeah, an icon charge.

No, yeah, it's not that expensive, right? And they are getting more I'm pretty sure they will ship more features there today. Yeah, the product would be better. And why not just keep track of the best product and at the first place, right? Yeah, it doesn't work. Cool.

S Speaker 214:44I used, we use cap card, but I don't think that's, yeah, I don't think that's for AI purpose. It's kind of like we have different short snip, short snippets, short video clips, and we want to stitch them together. Yeah. As in creating is kind of like creating the short clip. And, yeah, it's also, these are also no So, but we don't use the AI feature of Capcom at all. Yeah, it's more like human OS.

And normally you just use, like, 30 seconds, just put it there, and it gets three seconds out, that's the use case. And yeah, it's not that open, because the kind of interview is like once a month.
