S Speaker 10:03The way to communicate a new area altogether. This is not something that we live and breathe on a daily basis. If it was a chip startup, it's a different story altogether. If it's enterprise, enterprise SaaS, then it's also something I understand in this space. First, you have to tell you to get think about sales. Okay, if you want to sell somebody right now, you want to sell the vision of why this space is interesting. Then, first, you have to educate them on this industry. Everybody's got short attention span. You showed this slide

2:14And in this slide,
S Speaker 12:15you need to mention, in this slide, you need to mention, uh, uh, like, what does actually you need to have six. What does, what is agents, Arr, and valuation and investors. Arr, valuation, investors, okay, what is Synthesia? ARR valuation in like, instead of clubbing, you can have separate, okay, video you can only have for two to describe what it does, but one slide that just shows what are all the companies and then agent ARR investors and valuation, right? And for each one of these, you need to just say six. Pick six. Go with Arr, valuation. I don't want that. I think it's better to just show all. And we don't need three slides to go communicate that. We need one slide that just shows everything. That's that, because now, essentially what that communicates, and then you need to have key bullet points, key takeaways on top, are

you recording this? Yes, I have noticed. Okay, so
you recording this? Yes, I have noticed. Okay, so
you recording this? Yes, I have noticed. Okay, so
S Speaker 13:40key takeaways, two bullet points on top the key takeaway, one of the key takeaways from for me in this space, is

key takeaways, two bullet points on top the key takeaway, one of the key takeaways from for me in this space, is
key takeaways, two bullet points on top the key takeaway, one of the key takeaways from for me in this space, is
4:34the second takeaway,
S Speaker 14:37not here, I think over there in this slide, just that one takeaway. The other takeaway for me is, these are prosumer. Types of companies, mostly prosumer. Oh, you say prosumer. These are mostly prosumer. That's the second takeaway here, here in this slide, okay, and and then to elaborate more on the risks, which is, what are the risks right? The risks are. So I think you should have, like, a good section on risks. What are the risks? The risks are that this can get essentially the you always have to keep adding new features, and then there could be a high churn eventually or and then the true mode, technology mode. There's not a significantly high technology mode, yeah, so there is a chance that these fast growth revenues could churn or could
not here, I think over there in this slide, just that one takeaway. The other takeaway for me is, these are prosumer. Types of companies, mostly prosumer. Oh, you say prosumer.

S Speaker 15:46however, given now, so then that's a concern. So that's the second slack that we have, right? Okay, that risk highlight where the risk is. And then the key takeaway on that risk is that there is these are all prosumer and then they could

essentially either flatten or
S Speaker 16:11and at the same time over there, you show comps in that one that Slide, you show comps of consumer or prosumer companies. Right now, these startups have commanded higher valuation because, as we can see from Synthesia and everything, but over time, when they go public, like you have to take comms from Duolingo and Grammarly, and I'm sure you can pick some consumer prosumer comps, right? These comps are probably not that high. My guess is there are like 5x comps.

S Speaker 16:48is 22 that's a, I think that's a exception, yeah, but, but, yeah. But get get some realistic other comps as well, see Canva and figma, I would classify them as a big enterprise notion as well. Fair, yeah, and growing really fast, so you so show one side that if you grow really fast, then you can get these multiples. And if you, if you don't grow that fast, then you can get your multiples are significantly lower, right, right? Right, that's the wrist slide and hence. Like, that's why, honestly,
is 22 that's a, I think that's a exception, yeah, but, but, yeah. But get get some realistic other comps as well, see Canva and figma, I would classify them as a big enterprise notion as well.

like, if it's priced below 100
S Speaker 17:46and let's say this company gets to 100 million, Arr, right? Then this, this can get, still get sold for 500 million. Yeah, what I'm saying, you know, like, if it tapers after this. So that's the second slide, which is the entry valuation for this one is these interesting enough for us to spend time now. The other thing is now, the third one is now, what gets us excited, right? That's when we talk about product and team. For me, they're essentially in the product. We show their architecture today, and it's superior we've already compared to others in terms of, like this object, coherence, especially, it's superior. And so we have a slide on product. Why are we excited product? And then the second slide where I get excited is the team, right? This girl, what I observed with her were a few different things. She she couldn't stop talking. She was passionate about her company, but at the same time, you know, like she was present, she she could sell. My glass of water was empty, so she picked I give her the water bottle, and then she pours me first, and then she pours herself. Typically, what that means is, you, you know, I mean, you're not just full of yourself. You're, you know, and you're observing everything, and you're present, and then you're you're able to sell. So she's there to sell. Yeah, and then, and then she's making sure these small little things as well to me. And then she's passionate. And then the other one was, she's competitive, like I asked her, what, you know, what, like, what? Why the pivot she's for her, she was very honest. And for her, the key driver was one of our friends who had an inferior product, according to her at agent went viral, and she said, we have a much superior product than Hagen. So and then we can go way more viral than and then she's competitive. So, so what's driving her is this competitive spirit, and then the the other one is, then you have to look at the team, the rest of the team. So she has built this team in around this guy in Who's this? The NTU guy, 545, people there.
and let's say this company gets to 100 million, Arr, right? Then this, this can get, still get sold for 500 million. Yeah, what I'm saying, you know, like, if it tapers after this.

So that guy, and then this guy,
S Speaker 110:36the CTO, is also pretty smart. And then she herself has a pretty good background from all these places. So you put pictures of these guys as well, yeah, all right.

S Speaker 211:07So this is around web traffic analysis. Tushar. What's interesting here is, if you see, all of these players have reached raised much more larger rounds than creating, but creating is getting 1.275 monthly, million monthly visits, which is far superior.

S Speaker 211:40so creative is getting a lot of monthly visits for sure, as much as createify. Createify has raised five times more capital than create today. Icon, which had a Viral Launch, is still at 300k something visiting visitors at the same time, a lot of this referrals are coming from chatgpt. Perplexity for createy, seems like they have figured out that entire referral source as well. So broadly around this, it seems like they changed their domain name some months back. So we don't have a lot of historical data, but this is the current month.

S Speaker 114:09This I get, I think it's good. Here's what I want. Here. I want you to compare with these metrics with other prosumer what's the benchmark for the prosumer?

S Speaker 214:24Yes, so I will benchmark the LTV CAC ratio. But like, very simply, it's, it's in the top quartile, typically, I agree. Yeah. What about other metrics? Other metrics? Okay, CAC, I will benchmark, I have benchmark the retention matrix. So I'll show you that separately, and then have a few charts to benchmark them. Should we sort of have a chart as a reference point for this slide and then have key takeaways, or just their their numbers

14:58too complicated.
S Speaker 214:59This one's too complicated. So CAC benchmark, Tushar for photo and video, is $14 but then it's so it that's per install for creative, that's 40 cents.

S Speaker 115:14So you should, I think this chart you need to show, yeah, this can be stage one, actually, let's keep it in the backup. You can work on these, but work on those four, five that I mentioned before. Yeah. And then we should keep this like business model in metrics. Show me others, anything else that you think is unique

S Speaker 215:34and retention and engagement, presence, I have deleted for now, retention, engagement. Very strong retention matrix. I was actually very surprised. So they have weekly and yearly subscriptions. Weekly is today 15% of all revenue. Yearly is 85 which is, I guess, because of the pricing, weekly $7 and yearly is 39 starts with 39 so that's a smart way to do it. There's 12 months retention for weekly is 59% which, if you benchmark against some of these numbers

for photo and video here Tushar
S Speaker 116:12for I think we need more data. What we need is this, this whole retention, because this is only like 14 months old, so it doesn't say you say much, and if you have annual then, in fact, I would say that's at risk, right? We don't really know how many are churning. The biggest question is, how many? What's the usage, rather than like for those users, than retention?

S Speaker 216:34Yeah. So two metrics that comes out here is we have had three months where annual users have re bought the platform, and the average of that rebuying is 68% which is not bad. And benchmark, top benchmark in this category, top benchmark, top quartile, is 46.7% so these guys are doing much better than that. And engagement here, if you see this, is number of video generated per paid user every month. The engagement starts slightly higher, which is around 4040, videos per user, but does not go drop below 30. So the engagement is constant on the platform. People, once they are on the platform, they continue using it.

S Speaker 117:19Okay, this needs to be clarified. This chart, then you need to say this is engagement, okay, yeah, video Gen per user.

And then the you need to have
S Speaker 117:34two bullet points on top. What are you trying to say for retention? And what are you trying to say for what is the key takeaway? Understood? Key takeaway on every slide, on top, yes, on top, yeah.
