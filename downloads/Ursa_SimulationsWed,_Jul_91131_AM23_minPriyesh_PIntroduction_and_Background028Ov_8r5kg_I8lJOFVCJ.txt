S Speaker 10:55Yeah, exactly, exactly, we started grinding wave, yes. Thanks a lot for taking the time. I got to hear about ourselves from Ishan, like I mentioned, and particularly, I am spending some time in the entire physical AI space for Qualcomm ventures, because the area which is critically relevant for us, we feel there could be a lot of potential for Qualcomm to become a big silicon supplier in this entire space. And hence, we are looking at a lot of startups across different SIM to real robotics. Foundation, model, physical AI, IoT, multimodal, IoT, software, things like that. So several areas and quite interesting. Through your initial gloves, I have some little bit of understanding. So very, very interesting space. Would love to know a little bit more about you and how you got to start this and what's the plan with the team right now. Where are you at? And then maybe, to begin with, I can give you a brief background about the fund, and then we can kick it off, right? So I'm a senior associate here. I am with the Fund for about one and a half years now. Prior to that, I was with some time, and then with motif ventures in LA for some time. So very interesting space. The fund itself, I would say, we have been around for 25 years. We invest out of the balance sheet of Qualcomm, and Qualcomm, in the last few years, has diversified its products expansively. So now, not just being a mobile player. We are supplying chipsets to PCs. We have a cloud data center platform, XR, so a lot of different spaces where we feel we can then expand into investing in different sectors. And then the check sizes for us are typically two to $10 million we're typically a Series A plus investor, but we have started doing some seed as well in the last year or so. And then it's a global fund. We invest out of six different global offices, but in us, we typically aim to deploy about $150 million a year in around 10 to 12 startups.

So this venture is more strategic or financial. So yeah, it's
So this venture is more strategic or financial. So yeah, it's
S Speaker 12:34a little bit of hybrid between the both. I would say in investments that we do, we sort of take a very financial outlook in evaluating investments, but we do also sort of see if there is any strategic angle down the line. Can, can the company become a partner, go to market, partner and engineering partner, or can Qualcomm even serve as a customer for the company? So be back with some of those options. But I would say we are somewhere in between the entire strategic to financial sort

S Speaker 22:55of spectrum. Yeah, that's That's amazing. Thank you for the introduction. I guess the reason I ask is, I do think oil buildings should see a very big adopted opportunity and market in a semiconductor space. And I'll explain why quick self deduction and instruction of the company. So name is Ray, and until very recently, I was a research scientist at total research institute not too far away from I guess so there I was working with the teams around materials problems, right? And this, this is trying to basically take whatever they're like, what's really matter in the industry, and my background assimilation technology, to combine them, to try to change how people do things in the materials world in the future. And the idea here is to modernize Materials Engineering, right? I can show you the deck, but you know, different purpose. I can also

S Speaker 210:44Right? So right now, we haven't really signed the contract itself yet, right? So we are some of them are very close, like 10 bucks. Some of them were just conceiving the project. Now, as an initial trial, what we're shooting for is $50,000 trial.

S Speaker 111:02Understood. And and Ray Well, in like, I'm just trying to get a sense of the market. How big do you think these contracts can expand to in a few years? Kind of thing,
Understood. And and Ray Well, in like, I'm just trying to get a sense of the market. How big do you think these contracts can expand to in a few years? Kind of thing,

S Speaker 212:13So I think there's a key distinction here, is where what we are targeting is not the, not just the expert, right? So the if we're only targeting the you know, expert simulation scientists, that's a much smaller market. But what we what we're trying to do is automate things as much as we could, and making it as easy as it is, as we could make up to for people to use, right? AI interface automation, so that you know, your average materials engineers on the front line kind of can just ask, you know, questions the same way the expert will do right,

S Speaker 112:49right? And you're thinking of a sales motion, which would always be, say, enterprise sales driven motion Ray. Or do you also see materials engineers, independently of their organization, sort of adopting the solution.

13:58right? Understand that, right? Yes.
right? Understand that, right? Yes.
right? Understand that, right? Yes.
right? Understand that, right? Yes.
S Speaker 214:02So I think the next point I just want to, I want to make maybe a little bit subtle, but I think it's really important, because for companies like quanta, like apply materials, their their problem is not engineering cost, although saving the cost is nice, right? I think the problem here is, right? Because, like, I cannot speak for Bucha, but I do, I do speak a lot with engineers that apply material at land research, Tokyo electronics. Basically, what they have is they'll have the same customer go to all three of those and say, Hey, can you deliver me this material? The same question, whoever can deliver that first will win the contract, right? So what that means is that if you can be consistently just 10% faster than competitors, it's not a linear function of cost saving. It's a step function of you are the industrial leader, your customer, your competitors go out of business, just as simple as that, right? So faster go to market is really, really important. And if we know anything about you, know how snaps or answers speed up their corresponding fields of engineering, it's definitely more than 10% Yeah. So here's our target market, just just because I'm more more familiar with the catalysis and batteries, we're starting there. But as I said, semiconductor is a big, big market for us for many different reasons, for our technology, for the size of the market, and for how ready it is in the semiconductor market to adopt our solution. So I think that's a that's no brainer. That's our growth market. But how to get in there? It's a question to us, right? So that's why I'm really into you, because

right? Yeah, so I think it's
S Speaker 216:07much of this is also designed, right? So you need to go to like those, those companies to ask for maybe specific, you know, specifications and things like that. Of course, personally, I don't, I'm not really familiar with, but I think you can begin to, just begin, just make that request. Okay? I know that this specific material, based on our research, based on the simulation, would satisfy our need, right? That if you can take that to your to your supplier and make your go to market, really, much, much more faster, right? Other than you have to ask them to give you, okay, I need this material with this property. I'll meet you, and I take a long time

S Speaker 116:57understand that, understand that, right? That's, that's very interesting. I find the space quite interesting, although I'm not as familiar with material engineering myself. Would love to do a little bit more research at the same time. Ray, I'm very much happy to sort of make internal connections for you at Qualcomm. Do you have say a sales blurb or a deck that I can float around internally for the teams to view. And

S Speaker 217:25so I do, and Christian, maybe I think it's, I do cherish this, this opportunity, right? So let me also do some some research on my end. Like, do you, do you have, for example, simulation teams right now, already within Qualcomm.

S Speaker 218:15right under percent. I think would be great to have that conversation, and I can maybe also do my homework and see, you know, who might be most interested in our tool. And we can, you know, I can tailor the the deck to

S Speaker 118:31that, yeah, if that works, that'd be great, Ray. And where are you in terms of traction today, and are you planning to raise anytime soon?

S Speaker 218:39Right? So, we're planning to raise our first round outside of Toyota. So we do get our inception from Toyota. But as you say, as you see, we are attracting some users already. I know I do want to, I'll save you the details. But we are basically, while raising our first round outside $2 million $2

S Speaker 118:59million so that that would slightly be smaller for our check size. But let me, let me have a chat around that as well, internally within the team, if there is some appetite. But typically our check sizes, we have never done anything lower than two, so that that may be around earlier for us. But at the same time, I would still love to continue this conversation, get you in the doors at Qualcomm, sort of get you connected to the right folks, and maybe in the next week, come in,

S Speaker 219:28right? Sounds good, yeah. I think right now it's, it's also we just, we just got started, and you know we are, I'm also figuring out how many, how much we're raising, right? Yeah, that really depends on much of this also depends on the interest, which is like poor age. So there is a world where we need to raise more, yeah. So let's, let's keep chatting about this, and I'll keep you updated

S Speaker 119:53for sure, right? Keep me updated this. This is a pretty interesting space. I will do my own research and come back to you with some more questions on my end as well, but at the same time, meanwhile, I think from your end, let me know on the sales tech when you have a chance to research about Qualcomm and sort of tailor the sales tech according to that I post when you send me that, I will start some Qualcomm engagements. And meanwhile, if you can send me the deck as well, that would be great for my personal research.

S Speaker 120:28at the moment? Ray, this is, this was pretty interesting. I do have a few questions. Maybe I will send them to you over email, because I do need to frame them better. But I've been speaking to a few more AI simulation companies not targeting materials per se, sort of, in a way, a new gen AI native, CFD alternative. And maybe would love to get some of your thoughts perspectives on how this industry is shaping up, but I'll get back to you on some of those questions, and let's get this conversations going.

S Speaker 220:58Sure, and just on that real quick. I think there's also a chance, you know, I was talking to a client earlier, right? So they also do a lot of CFDs or photos. I don't know if it's an interest of outcome, but there's definitely the industry adapts FEM, CFD, those kind of things very well already. The point I'm trying to make is for these simulations, right? The parameters has to come from someone, yeah, right, right now it's again during a lab and poured it into into our pm or safety model. So actually, one active things we are exploring is bridging this optimistic modeling to the CFDs fems of the world, right? So they can just query us for their parameters, so that don't have to measuring map anymore. Yeah, this idea of like everything from first principle, right? So that's a that's something I think we almost become the infrastructure of every other simulations in the world. I think that that is also a very powerful market in and of itself, right?
