S Speaker 22:08where, for context, like will had introduced us, will I for my team? Yes, we're in the middle of our series, a fundraise, and so it's great. It's super fun. But, like, just the cadence of, you know, stuff is a lot.

S Speaker 12:22I know Kevin, like my the magic partner I work with, he always says that the best founders don't like the fundraising process. They just want to go back to building. And it kind of, I feel a little bit bad, because that's the process I live in, but, but I totally understand where you're coming from. It's funny,

S Speaker 22:42everything, and it's actually, candidly, part of why I'm actually trying to slow down a little bit to be thoughtful, is, right, like, you know, whoever takes that, this lead investor position, they're going to be my partner for the next 10 years. Yes, and, you know, I really hope we like folks commentators in two weeks, like, sure, but do you know that that board member you're bringing on who, in your darkest moments, you're going to have to call and say, Oh my gosh. You know we're, you know, our biggest customer just canceled. What do we do?

S Speaker 13:17I totally get that. I totally get that some of the board stories that I've heard from the team, just crazy. So I totally understand where you're coming from. Kevin, where you based, though. So I live in

S Speaker 23:26Woodside, so just just west of Palo Alto, yeah. And then our office is in San Francisco.

S Speaker 13:34Got it, got it, very interesting. So our offices are split between the Bay Area and San Diego, where the Qualcomm headquarters is, and I would say we have six members here, four in San Diego, and broadly, Kevin. Don't have a lot of context on the fundraising. I just met well at the ML ops event, had a great conversation, because we are very actively looking at a lot of agent building platforms, both from an investment perspective, but there's also a lot of appetite internally at Qualcomm to partner with some of them. Yeah, we
Got it, got it, very interesting.

Yeah, we
S Speaker 24:11were talking to the Salesforce team. Oh, yeah, we don't want to put a big check and blah, blah, blah, you could put in a really big check as a customer. And you know, we'll do it
were talking to the Salesforce team. Oh, yeah, we don't want to put a big check and blah, blah, blah, you could put in a really big check as a customer. And you know, we'll do it

S Speaker 14:21any of the week, yeah, right, right. So yeah, there's potential to be Qualcomm as a customer, but that at the same time, what Qualcomm has done recently, like I would say, over the last five years, has really expanded compute across a lot of different platforms. So we now have npus made shipping natively on PCs mobiles, which where we started from, a lot of IoT XR devices. We also have an upcoming cloud infrastructure play, so a lot of platforms. We have a call from Ai hub where we that's in partnership with hugging face of one of our portfolio companies, where we host a lot of models, there are a lot of developers building agents and applications on top of llms for edge devices, like some of the ones that I mentioned. So those are some of the partnerships that broadly I have in my mind, can loop in a few more members of my team to sort of double click on some of those. But broadly, would like to have this conversation sort of try to understand where hyper mode is. We recently spoke to some of the more, I would say, flashy players in the market, like crew, AI, autogen, Lang, Lang chain has been, like, a big partner for us for a long time. So trying to understand broadly on, how do you differentiate yourself in the market? How has the reception been so far? So, I mean,
any of the week, yeah, right, right.

S Speaker 210:40I think it's, I mean, it's on this panel last night. I think it's totally possible. And I think that's what's like, really hard for any of us in the brain. Like, I wouldn't say we're, like, a tools maker, but we're sort of between tools and, like a vertical app. And so a lot of what we're doing is, like, guessing about, you know, where, kind of that first S curve, flat spot is, and you know what? We'll go to business on top of, I think the again, like the thing that I am, I'm confident about,
I think it's, I mean, it's on this panel last night. I think it's totally possible. And I think that's what's like, really hard for any of us in the brain.

thing that these, these platforms can do really well is, like,
S Speaker 211:22one understanding the right abstractions and, like, that's who's going to win. Obviously, I have my beliefs, but, you know, it all depends on MCPS development and stability. It all depends on, you know, how well do these models evolve over periods of time? Yeah, like, for example, one of the big IP assets that we have, and I'll show you briefly, is like we have this, like agent runtime, which is called MODIS, that one of the things, for example, like, if you took like a Lang chain, which is a Python library, as a library, it can't make those determinations for your actual agentic application of, how do I handle connection pooling? How do I handle scaling, like all those things are actually handled at the like application level, not in a library. And so I think some of those platforms will have to reinvent themselves, to participate in this, like runtime over library modality, and then on the you know, couldn't a cursor just by code this up, maybe I like, I think it's where you know, it'll be very curious to see if you know, a Zapier can figure out the right abstractions and modalities we think we've gotten right. You know, we're getting to work with some really good folks in candidly, you know, I I built four unicorns in a row. Like, Yeah, I figured
one understanding the right abstractions and, like, that's who's going to win. Obviously, I have my beliefs, but, you know, it all depends on MCPS development and stability.

12:56this one out. Right,
S Speaker 212:59right? Three and a half. You know, one was a unicorn that got marked down, but I was gone at that point. But,
right? Three and a half. You know, one was a unicorn that got marked down, but I was gone at that point. But,

right? Three and a half. You know, one was a unicorn that got marked down, but I was gone at that point. But,
13:05yeah, totally, you can even count that up for sure. Again,
yeah, totally, you can even count that up for sure. Again,
yeah, totally, you can even count that up for sure. Again,
yeah, totally, you can even count that up for sure. Again,
S Speaker 213:10in the interest of time, I can show you the very quick version of the way our platform works. So this is, this is a presets. Is my fake van den, me farms environment. And once you've set up all of your connections, this is what you'll see. And like, I'd like to build an agent, uh, what's, what's something you do already, uh, you DO Company Research. So I'll do to do your company research for investor. And I'm cheating a little bit, because Tom Tonga is yesterday, is one of the other firms that we're working with published his, his This is my company research workflow. So I made one of these yesterday. Yeah. But So basically, the way this was, what ended up working is I kind of give like, again, pretending like I don't know how many I works, I just test, hey, I want to do this. And it's like I'm an individual.

S Speaker 214:14And intentionally, I always try to show like, look how vague I'm being. It's because I'm not trying to overly guide the agent, and it's trying to basically extract, because what's happening under the covers here is so behind the

S Speaker 214:36scenes we're like, essentially populating This manifest of what models, tools, connections, does this agent need? And then we're also essentially generating system prompt to then construct the agent, and then figure out, well, you know, do I need access to other agents, and so forth. Let's do all of it. I'm just trying to, like, you know, just to skip through it. And so it's constructing these pieces. Yeah, uh,
scenes we're like, essentially populating This manifest of what models, tools, connections, does this agent need? And then we're also essentially generating system prompt to then construct the agent, and then figure out, well, you know, do I need access to other agents, and so forth. Let's do all of it.

I'm just trying to, like, you know, just to skip through it. And so it's constructing these pieces. Yeah, uh,
S Speaker 115:05and Kevin, quick question here is, is this sort of constructing the entire system flow very dynamically, or are there any verticals that you have sort of fine tuned the models on where you have more customers and you've worked on closer feedback loop kind of thing.

S Speaker 215:22So we, again, we built a bunch of like, under the covers tools within the system. But these tend to be built very dynamically. And the reason why I don't like to overly bit or steer these, these agents looks good, is like, I don't know how much of an AI nerd you are, but like, back in like, the late 90s, early 2000s there was this, like, this thing called X Congress of expert systems. I think that's the right mechanism for large agentic systems to be built around. Is, like, very narrow domains with, like, basically, like, kind of, what we've discovered over time is, like with deep learning models, the narrower the main and the narrower the job, the easier it is for you to score very high inference, you know, like, evals, yeah. And so I don't want to say this is a sales robot, because, like, sales is a very multi disciplinary function with all these different constructions of, like, an enterprise seller, mid market, BBB, SAS, licensing, whatever. And so it's, again, my goals. I want to give you a pretty blank slate agent that you then as the enterprise seller in the southeast selling database to oil companies. You know, like, I want your agents. Like I'm I'm built for you. And so, so what's just happened under the covers here is I built the Qualcomm debut deal bot.

But maybe I'll say I really want access to Gmail, because I'm gonna have it access stuff for
So we, again, we built a bunch of like, under the covers tools within the system. But these tend to be built very dynamically. And the reason why I don't like to overly bit or steer these, these agents looks good, is like, I don't know how much of an AI nerd you are, but like, back in like, the late 90s, early 2000s there was this, like, this thing called X Congress of expert systems. I think that's the right mechanism for large agentic systems to be built around. Is, like, very narrow domains with, like, basically, like, kind of, what we've discovered over time is, like with deep learning models, the narrower the main and the narrower the job, the easier it is for you to score very high inference, you know, like, evals, yeah. And so I don't want to say this is a sales robot, because, like, sales is a very multi disciplinary function with all these different constructions of, like, an enterprise seller, mid market, BBB, SAS, licensing, whatever. And so it's, again, my goals. I want to give you a pretty blank slate agent that you then as the enterprise seller in the southeast selling database to oil companies. You know, like, I want your agents. Like I'm I'm built for you. And so, so what's just happened under the covers here is I built the Qualcomm debut deal bot.

I know I've only got 12 minutes left. Let's pretend I'd spent like, half an hour working with this agent teaching, oh, hey, don't spend your time on the executive team. I want you to actually don't look at deal book. Their data is always wrong. Go look at, I don't know, this Twitter account. I don't care. And so, like, maybe, like, just for the interest of time. So here's a version where, for Van Gundy farms, I taught Hagrid how to go and check the weather and then make a determination whether we should close the farm and, like, update my company website. What I can end up doing is, once I've taught the agent something and I'm happy with its performance, basically we call it create task, and all that's doing is essentially, is like synthesizing the essentially, like the flow of conversation into like a one shot set of instructions to then allow me to schedule that task to happen. Of, hey, every Monday, hey, when a web hook comes in, when a another agent pings you, you kick off this workflow. And so you're able to, like repeatedly, once you've trained the agent to complete a specific task. You can then save this task and, like, set it up to run asynchronously for you. And yeah, I can be kicking off. I could have like, 25 different threads of Hagrid representing me, training it to do a different task. And then I can go back to my Qualcomm. But okay, so Qualcomm did a bunch of research, and it looks like it forgot to email me. Go ahead,

S Speaker 225:13maybe this is, like a broader topic, like, I'm a very big believer in, like, what I'll call it, the consumerization of enterprise where our sales motion is heavy, the heavy metal enterprise, where both myself and my sales leader, you know, we made our career selling to global 2000 companies, yeah. But the, I think the magic trick probably made for sell grow so fast, is if I do the hard work for my my user and go and build a relationship with the head of data science, the head of data developer platform, and get the thing set up. And then, you know, I, you know, my life gets really wonderful when you have this, like, prosumer motion of, you know, we're doing this right now at work rise where they're like a billion dollar staffing company Jordan, the head of data there, again, I'm saying, Jordan, don't worry about the dollars. Your forecast. You're probably going to spend, you know, 84 grand a year with us, but your upfront cost is zero. I'm going to invest the resources to get you built up. But you know, you don't have this big line item to fight with your procurement team about. And then, you know, we're confident that when he rolls this out to his sales team, his marketing team, you know, we asymptote use it, right? And so we were not doing the like self serve plg thing. It is, go earn the MSA with a large organization, and then, you know, to be fair, we do have a lot of large enterprises who just sign up with a credit card. But, like, I don't think that's a durable notion. I think it's just like, there's an AI froth, and people are just like, Oh, hey, this is great. I'll attempt to get my Gmail. I'll get started. But you know, the plan is we want to do, large cap

S Speaker 127:01makes sense. And Kevin, lastly, on the fundraise, how big a round Are you raising? I haven't given you an overview of the fund itself, so I'll close with that. But how big a round Are you raising? And what's the timeline you're looking at? Broadly. Yeah.

S Speaker 227:15So the funnel, I went out asking for 10, it's looking like we're probably going to raise 15 again, like I haven't signed a term sheet yet. You know, we're still figuring it out. But yeah, 10 to 15 million is the total raise post money. All say between like 60 and

S Speaker 227:41and then timeline, my goal is to get this done, you know, by by the end of next week. I don't know if that's going to happen. I picked, like, the worst month possible to fundraise, where all the VCs are traveling. And so, you know, I'm guessing probably by end of June, we'll have, you know, selected our lead. We'll be doing allocations, kind of in a lot of rolling basis,
