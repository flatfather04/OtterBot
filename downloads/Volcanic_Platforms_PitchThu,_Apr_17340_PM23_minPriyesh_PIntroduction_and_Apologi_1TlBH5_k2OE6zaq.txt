S Speaker 20:22I get reason I get back to is I have two three emails, and everything goes to one schedule, and sometimes there are glitches in meetings appear in the schedule. So I remember it was 15, and I said, Well, if it didn't show up on schedule, and then if you send it, I would look really bad that I didn't show up in meetings. My

S Speaker 10:42body it just went down, and I forgot sending me an email, but I'm glad we could connect today. How are you? How are things with volcano? I think the last time we spoke, you gave me a good overview of the company. I've gone through your deck, so I understand a little bit there, but we'd love to understand more from you. And then, do you remember the overview I gave you about Qualcomm ventures? Or would you like me to give a quick intro about the fund,

S Speaker 11:18CVC? Yeah, actually, the CVC has been operating for 25 years now. So we have been there quite a long in market. We have deployed, sorry about that. We are deploying, we have deployed more than $2 billion in capital. And right now we have 300 plus active portfolio companies. So the CBC has been quite active, I would say. It's a global fund. So we are here in us. But other than that, Latin America, Israel, China, India, Europe as well. So quite wide variety of focus areas there. And then Qualcomm setting, as you can imagine, we have expanded from just being a mobile and connectivity player to now our chips go on into a lot of AR VR devices, a lot of AI PCs. Also. We have an upcoming cloud computing platform. And hence we feel a lot of we can expand, from an investment perspective, into a lot of sectors as well. So physical AI, broadly speaking, is a very exciting space for us. We feel down the line when compute would be brought on edge, and there will be a lot of AI which will enable physical simulations, Qualcomm would be a big player there. And hence we want to invest in some of these spaces. I am particularly trying to create a thesis on physical AI and present it internally within the team, also to Qualcomm and see if we can find some interesting investments in that area, and that's

S Speaker 22:27I wanted to talk to you today. Yeah, so physical AI has when I say physical AI, I think a lot of CFD companies use that term. You probably saw many of them in the physical AI is is more like building a factory logistics or building and manufacturing a ship, right? The AI has a perfect place there. Everything is known. Data is there, schedules are there. You know, robots can do those, right? The physical AI in ao science is, I don't know you saw my second chart.

3:18like, I think there's a bubble my databases.
like, I think there's a bubble my databases.
like, I think there's a bubble my databases.
like, I think there's a bubble my databases.
S Speaker 23:23So database, so in physical AI, this machine learning model AI, whatever you call It's a garbage, and garbage out, and can you make it not garbage? And that's the biggest problem, right? The CFD is probably the only way to develop this database, because you need really fine data, and ground and fine test data are sparse, like the wind tunnel or blood testing or flight test you need to, you need tremendous amount of data, and that is coming from computers, right so, but I don't Know your background. CFD, like aerodynamics and artistic those phenomena are non linear phenomena. You really cannot get two points away from each other, and then you do interpolation, and then machine learning, those points have to be so close to each other that way, the interpolation Priyesh network makes sense, right? So, and in, okay, this is my personal opinion. All of us quite busy in DTC, physical AI people write with the term. So they do one or two case, they show maybe, like you probably saw beyond that, there is a company called physics X. There is company called RPX. So I think how, how quickly you can get physics, simulations, and how accurate it is, and a customer how, how easily they don't have this database is the key. Like we we have been dealing with, we have two paying customers. I have a dozen customer they are trying. They are evaluating our software. And we have two universities are using the industry. Never go to, like a physics X or beyond that type of companies, you know, those, those companies are, you know, it's like a smart language model, and all those are great. It's working for something. But the company will never give their database. So they will, they will use this, whether it is working on scales or something else. And they develop the database preparatory to them, and their engineers develop the machine learning model. So this beyond man's physics, exit is not a good model. It's not a good business model. So what it has been is they need infrastructure so they can do machine learning. So the way I am introducing them is, I don't introduce them AI company, I introduce them. I am the creator of the database, right? The creator of the database that AI can be utilized? Yes, right? And there are a couple of companies like CMR, you know, they streamline the process. Like, once we develop this data, they are actually approaching me to be a partner. I say it's early. Let's do that partnership later. I mean, when I talk to customers, like, if they say, you take one of my customer actually, I can actually tell their name, because they they publicly say they are using skills like ambly engineers. They're working with Nvidia modules, the model, next data, and that's what we provide, right? So this is the benefit of our software to industry. So you don't need this big cluster. You need just one box. But it doesn't mean you cannot use big cluster. You can use 10 to editorial jobs you can run if you have a big cluster, right? So that's beyond democratizing. CFD, that not like doe, DOD, NASA, scientists can do those jobs. Can run those jobs, and that's real research and development environment. Engineers can do that every engineers are so happy that they are using it. I mean, they are submitting a lay paper, they're going to workshop. Still keep this between us, because they don't want to release their name right away. Useful scales with them, so I'm cautious. They're giving their name to people

understand that? Totally fine. Yeah, I think
S Speaker 27:43I mean, the reason I send you this is I know we have 30 minutes, we might have another meeting. So instead of doing line by lively charts, I want to give you, like, a big picture of where we are, yeah, and then if you have questions related to charts or the discussion, we might address that. So I think we are, as I mentioned, we started two years ago, almost two years one month. You know, I started with with my funding. So I am the sole financier company right now, because the reason is like they still need funding, right? This is our own path. So I went to the show. I have a valuable product, I have interested customers, and then I'm still thinking whether I should go funding now for acceleration mode, right? Yeah, so, so I think we, I would like to point to, I will be putting $2.25 million by June, I will have a complete volcano scales, and I am going to go to another development. So volcano habit is steady state simulation. Volcano scales, everything is unsteady, turbulence, acoustics and all those right. So if you look at any aerodynamics or aerodynamic simulation, CFD runs maybe 70, 80% are steady state. So for a database, CFD engineer runs 100 case,
I mean, the reason I send you this is I know we have 30 minutes, we might have another meeting.

S Speaker 29:20deviation, standard deviation of their functions, it could be an inch drag moment. So if that standard deviation is getting smaller and smaller, like a flat that means the solution is converged. If it becomes bigger, the functional becomes lesser, that means you are not dissolving the physical phenomena. You need additional modeling. So it goes, most likely it's going to go to time dependent turbulence simulation, like 70% they run rapid and then 30% 20% they run scales. So you may ask me why you started with a difficult one, right? The reason is there are so many steady state simulations, all those things you saw, like ANSYS star, CCM, they found this random simulations, right? If I go to a customer, hey, I have 2x better they will not drop the software they use. They're gonna say, Oh, I'm good. I'm trained with this, but I'm providing the customer that they don't have it so they need it. So they jump into my and then I introduce something in the market, which I mean rapid is still going to be a solution in minutes. So immediate Omniverse AI group have been talking to me because the LED Omniverse is caring about rapid, right? They need, like, a real time simulations, one or two. They don't want to have simulations with ops, right? So I think I can tell you where I am, like, maybe the last one, like, I mean, this is like a couple of months of the chart. So maybe there are I'm adding at least right now, I have 10 non being potential customer elevating my software. Some of them started three or four months ago. Some of them just get a copy. And last year, I had two RFI, and those RFI completed in December. And those are paying customers. One of them is Ambria, the other still doesn't

So it goes, most likely it's going to go to time dependent turbulence simulation, like 70% they run rapid and then 30% 20% they run scales. So you may ask me why you started with a difficult one, right? The reason is there are so many steady state simulations, all those things you saw, like ANSYS star, CCM, they found this random simulations, right? If I go to a customer, hey, I have 2x better they will not drop the software they use. They're gonna say, Oh, I'm good. I'm trained with this, but I'm providing the customer that they don't have it so they need it. So they jump into my and then I introduce something in the market, which I mean rapid is still going to be a solution in minutes. So immediate Omniverse AI group have been talking to me because the LED Omniverse is caring about rapid, right? They need, like, a real time simulations, one or two. They don't want to have simulations with ops, right? So I think I can tell you where I am, like, maybe the last one, like, I mean, this is like a couple of months of the chart. So maybe there are I'm adding at least right now, I have 10 non being potential customer elevating my software. Some of them started three or four months ago. Some of them just get a copy. And last year, I had two RFI, and those RFI completed in December. And those are paying customers. One of them is Ambria, the other still doesn't

11:17want to fast company
S Speaker 211:22that I think I do have six, seven companies that I have communication. I am not pushing myself to go and give them an executable drive license because I don't have the bandwidth. I only have five people, all of them, including myself. At our same time, we are application engineers. So I spent like, you know, yesterday, I spent from 5pm to 7pm and then 11pm to 1am two telecoms with Japan, right? Because of time to this, right? So then when you increase those companies, it becomes available, like my developers. Are you their time is more important right now, I agree,

S Speaker 212:09a place that, to be honest, I started talking to one CDC, they said, in communication with one lead DC, they asked me to have one more final meeting. He's in Japan right now. I can't tell his name is wenchi, so I have been talking to both of them. And I mean, whether we talked to me like a year ago, I don't want to get VC money to just accelerate earlier, because all those application engineers, I'll be spending money, but I'm not getting anything out of them until I'm ready. So I think. And then, to be honest with you, there are, there are three, like, let me see, 1234, 1234, there are five VCs. Some of them are CBC, some of them smaller VCs. I had interaction with past three or four months. I told them, I will get back to them. I didn't get back to them, right? They are interested. Two, three of them talk to me in one of the hotel room and doing GTC, not hotel room, hotel lobby at GTC like prior to so they are interested. I am not. I mean, if I go with some funding, I don't want to bring five, six pieces, it's going to be and, you know, one part of me is saying, why don't you go with 2.7 5 million for one and a half year, and then second part is two and a half million, if needed, 5.2 5 million. Part Two and blogster speed. I'm kind of liberating. Which one is good. Also, I'm trying to be extremely cautious not to get too much money right, because limited economic example, like if they get hundreds already, and I don't they are getting for third round.

S Speaker 214:57them, but that's for me, if anyone want to master platforms, I'm telling them upfront, this is not the company that AI app that you're going to get to customers. CFD is in each market. Physics. AI is going to grow, but there's no CFD company that will go to IPO. I haven't seen it. I mean, S is probably company, but it's a combination of two startups, right? Of doing startups at some point, as long as it's in a niche area that competitive, those four or five companies, I would say ANSYS is going to be acquired by synapses analysis are going to be competing for functionality and maybe hexagon, those are going to be grabbing a successful company similar to volcano. So how much they are going to pay money is going to be between 60, 70 million to 120 invested, how much that they don't really pay that money for number of x times number of like a revenue type, it used to be, but now that becomes like 20x 20x because there's a there's acquisition at the functionality, and they're looking at how much they can hurt each other. So I mean, if I, if I get 2.75 then I really put 2.25 that's a 5 million to one. Younger company is somewhere around 225 million. That's like, if I total the money somewhere and a half, that's the that's the higher end, right beyond that doesn't make sense, like, it doesn't make sense, and for a VC to be product. So my goal is to make it to eat as much, as much as possible from those, from these big guys, to be hungry, to get us in a year or two. I am ahead of them. So I'm getting the customers from Cadence and the sun right now, all my customers are power flow. Are you familiar with power flow? No power flow is like a logistics code.
