S Speaker 10:15So let me kick off with some of the big pictures. So first of all, this is the US market snapshots, US only and the global so the revenue growth for Gen AI videos are increasing really from expected. So this number is purely the revenue from Gen Ed videos expecting to grow to 28 billion by 2030 with a 35 year over year kicker and and basically there are two layers of the players. We look at the foundation, models and studios, and also the applications and adoption patterns. Is that enterprise trying really hard to build these cases in training and marketing and also, if we have consumers adoption, usage increased significantly, a lot of the past few months and also past year. And all of this is actually enabled by the compute. So the compute cost per drop significantly, since one is 80% reduction of the compute cost. So that's why you see a lot of players for both foundational layer on the vacations. Build a product, build a vacation. Then so this is similar to adding to the chat,

S Speaker 11:54app, zoom out. So we see the video as a big part of the content. Okay, yeah, so, so this is a big Gen AI wave. Of course, the video is big, generic. Here that content wise, we see that global Gen AI content creation increased significantly. That's okay, girl, 31.2% year over year, and within this the digital human avatars increasing even faster than the content generation. So the key drivers behind this is, number one, the rise of the personal media. So over 92% of the business will use AI driven personalization to drive their business growth. And also there is explosion in the automated content. So we see that 47% of this media, or social media actually powered by AI, either text or image or video, or actually, almost half were generated by AI and also, well, next to the because of the massive cost and efficiency, again, actually useful ai ai generation tools, you see 90% reduction in both The cost and production time for the content generation. So without that, you see the journey as to video like the both of the videos on YouTube, you have almost 40 plus billion views
app, zoom out. So we see the video as a big part of the content. Okay, yeah, so, so this is a big Gen AI wave. Of course, the video is big, generic.

S Speaker 17:37Okay, so these are the, I think, the three top players after we're talking, we think runway, Luma and Moon Valley are the three top players for foundation model player and runway is actually, actually the leading one in terms of the bottle quality, in terms of their book market and also revenue traction and broad move. Runway, right now has the highest valuation among the three they just announced the new round and the CO validation overview for the 5 billion. And this is a very sensitive one, but they also have very high AR is already above 100 million, and they're the leading player for the self advertisement of the new generation. So they partner with a lot of advertisement studios. Also they have a consumer and enterprise customers. So and then we also talk to our spend a lot of time with Luma, and Luma leads in the model of 3d and Luma has a lot of very strong community in consumers and also social media. So their use based in consumer is probably the focus. Of course, they're projecting progression with other AR for this year through coming with Netflix and Amazon. And national the interesting one is Moon Valley. And I spent a lot of time with Moon Valley. The team is has a strong like a big group, elite group, of the researchers across different hyperscalers. And they recruited these researchers in the student team. And also they bought a studio in college which provided a lot of high quality data. And also they developed the food like studious with kind of products so that they can partner with movie producers directly to generate wisdom. So they're planning that they're going to have about 40 million Arr, and they're coming with Amazon Prime video.
Okay, so these are the, I think, the three top players after we're talking, we think runway, Luma and Moon Valley are the three top players for foundation model player and runway is actually, actually the leading one in terms of the bottle quality, in terms of their book market and also revenue traction and broad move.

9:53And when I just call
9:56David, yeah, so they claim
David, yeah, so they claim
David, yeah, so they claim
David, yeah, so they claim
S Speaker 19:59that they're from the exclusive partner with them, and so when we think about any sense when they are today to our agency, whether they can truly tap into the moving production process and generate the high quality content also Now move Valley claims that the length of the generation is over 30 seconds. So I do think that maybe over the next few years, the output length everyone will be catching up, and also everyone will be having a high quality of the of the video generation. So this sector pretty capital intensive, also very competitive and and it's not easy to get a higher AR Because It's project based. So let's say they're focusing on working with some of these video and then after one episode, or after one like series, what's next? So this one, maybe we need to give a long time horizon to to observe. And this is like the chat to the teacher moments right now.

12:16is very high. The
S Speaker 512:22rocks Okay, so now to application layer. Of application layer

rocks Okay, so now to application layer. Of application layer
S Speaker 112:34is where most of the startups generating real revenue, because enterprise really see the ROI so see the over 70% of the production cost reduction using the tool, the tools or the tools that's not provided. And also we see that 80% of the production time saved, like four weeks of two hours of this content generation, these are the enterprise customers feedback and for AI generate ads. People also see that the return on ads pending improved by 10 to 25% and also higher conversions from the personalized creative advertisements. And also they turn x more creative testing with the same budget. So this efficiency and also return, you can see a clear return trend here for the AI direct edge, with no players created by AC space, and in terms of consumer so we see the strong volume and very obvious wave that consumer use, like build their own editor Talking Figure. However, the thickness is not proven yet, so there's always a pretty high churning. Also, of the different rate is 40% after three days usage, three days trial period. So the peak here is what workflow integration. So for enterprise customers, if you can have this, for example, the one click Publish into the social media or into their internal system, and then the users are willing to adopt and so the integration is very important. It's a p1 company we talked to called Open split, so they have that web click, sort of publish after the generation. And then we saw the high adoption of SMB, okay. So here is the some of the data showing the trend on also the net retention and SUV. So the top of the use case that has the highest SUV and better, probably the best net retention is enterprise avatars. That's where they show a lot of good ROI and also the, yeah, that's, that's where enterprise avatar is having the, probably the best ICD and retention, and then the enterprise stuffing and following by the pro editing tools, enterprise advertisement creation. And the last piece, always the consumer or consumer generators, as I mentioned earlier, that you see the trend is the highest among 30 to 40% so give a deep dive into the AI avatar. So that's where you see in the in the application layer that have the highest ACD and also the retention rate. So what is the Avatar? So AI avatar combined really stays with this embedding voice to create the talking characters that can communicate with a human like expressions and movements. So and recently published a report on AI avatar, say that the next
is where most of the startups generating real revenue, because enterprise really see the ROI so see the over 70% of the production cost reduction using the tool, the tools or the tools that's not provided. And also we see that 80% of the production time saved, like four weeks of two hours of this content generation, these are the enterprise customers feedback and for AI generate ads.

So and recently published a report on AI avatar, say that the next
16:09Jenny and I avatar,
S Speaker 116:13because in 2025 there's a lot of breakthrough exercise. At the end of 2024 there's a lot of tech breakthrough so the phone to lightning is getting better so it's more vivid. And also facial expression is a weapon of text breakthrough. And also you see a lot of talking about talking characters have this body movement natural. So there are some tech breakthroughs that really improve the adoption enterprise, and in terms of use cases, consumer, SMB, enterprise use cases for most of the consumer, consumer is the character creation and digital storytelling. And also a lot of AI implementers are using the avatars to show the virtual personalities. And for SMB, this is mostly advertisements and also product devils. For enterprise use cases, the learning development, the executive presence, the marketing and PR are complications. So things here Haitian and who are all tagging at enterprise use cases and also,
because in 2025 there's a lot of breakthrough exercise. At the end of 2024 there's a lot of tech breakthrough so the phone to lightning is getting better so it's more vivid.

And also facial expression is a weapon of text breakthrough. And also you see a lot of talking about talking characters have this body movement natural. So there are some tech breakthroughs that really improve the adoption enterprise, and in terms of use cases, consumer, SMB, enterprise use cases for most of the consumer, consumer is the character creation and digital storytelling. And also a lot of AI implementers are using the avatars to show the virtual personalities. And for SMB, this is mostly advertisements and also product devils.

S Speaker 117:32So this is a marketing map of bioengineerson. So how they map the sector is they have methods into character animation creators clothes and also the advertisement generation enterprise use cases. So one interesting startup that we talked to recently is a core so Accor just started like last year, but they generated the problem. They are having almost 40 million invoices that they are as of today, so they wrapping up really fast. So we noticed that the leading within the leading players need to have or demonstrate pretty strong, superior products with a lot of product features that really matter to the enterprise or the SMB customers that can demonstrate a strong and growing Arr, and also need to show the early signs of strong retention. So when we come to a pool, we also proved validated that a lot of consumer actually even when they show immediate Arr, but the retention was not good. So then they have to squeeze out these after 30 days, you have to take out this AR. So many of the players are not doing that. So that's something we need to focus on diligence and also, ideally, most of the big players that have their self developed like small models, like voice models or weak models, and of course, we are hoping that they have the reliable data source and can demonstrate sustainable content loss margin, ideally about 7% So in terms of investment recommendation, I personally feel a lot more comfortable to bet on the application, which means that enterprise, consumer vertical, and I think AI Avar may be a good direction to To bet on my advertisers,

I think in terms of the model players, we can do some selective back, I think more like in the during the chat, meeting to meeting, two moments, and they will need the more capital to continue to develop the model, development model. And we will see a lot of I think, I think, I think what this one, I was a little bit hesitant on whether it is a central bank at this stage, but we will keep a close eye on doing that.

S Speaker 223:16So the question is, like they get solved by a technology breakthrough, then should we go for companies that are coming up in earlier stages, or is there? So if that's the case, then the companies that are raising more capital will have significant advantage. Yeah, they will have a block, because then you get COVID and dropping, decided in the space, yeah,

S Speaker 123:45I think, from model perspective, what, as you said, that the consistency and the controllability, I think one problem is that you can only generate the video right? But in order to have the video to follow the way on, the movie producers, when you want to show you have to give that precise control pump. And they're doing really good in the control already, because they have this both embedded that's kind of in the very technical right. And my students are working a lot of capital to continuously improve the model quality, and they need a lot more high quality data and also probably human

But in the meantime, like how much do you fuse to transformer models with diffusion models, you can tune very easy to do in the training process to make they will decide how much ability you have once you produce the video and Luma. They're talking about, of course, they're rooting 2d, to three, right? But they also talk about, they are looking beyond video generation. They try to think about what you need to do.
