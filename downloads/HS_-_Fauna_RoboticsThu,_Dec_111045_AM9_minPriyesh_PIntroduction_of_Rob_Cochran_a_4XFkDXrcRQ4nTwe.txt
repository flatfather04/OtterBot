S Speaker 20:58company with with an idea that robots should give back human agency and really inspire and delight those around us. So that's our North Star. But we also started the company with an insight that today's robots were totally ill suited to deployment among people. They're generally physically dangerous, dangerous to be around. They're too strong and heavy. If 150 pound or an even 80 pound robot falls on you or a child, that's obviously a risk that's unacceptable. They're too expensive to deploy in economically viable jobs, the kind of jobs that we might imagine robots working near term, and the design feels more pulled from Terminator in Westworld than the stories that inspire us.

S Speaker 21:48And so our mission at fauna is to build safe and reliable robots for everyone and to make them very broadly available so they can work in our homes, in our offices, in our public spaces, not be confined just two factories and warehouses around us, but doing so and bringing this to life requires a different approach. You can't just retrofit industrial hardware and put it in real world environments. And so we started from the ground up to reimagine what a functional and capable robot could look like when it's lightweight, soft, interact, it's something you actually want it to be around.

S Speaker 22:31this available is as a platform for developers to actually engage with and build on. And we think that a stable and safe hardware platform paired with an SDK that is modular, full stack and interactive, actually gives people the right substrate to start building and extending into more. And I'm not sure what corruption is happening at the bottom of the slide here, but basically we aligned on four key principles for building out this platform. Safety comes first. If you're going to put robots in human spaces, it has to be safe. I think we as an industry are not yet ready to deploy full size humanoids to work alongside people, and so starting with something that is lighter weight, more interactive and physically safe to be around is the right starting point. It has to be developer ready. So we're working with companies, AI, labs and individuals who actually want to build and extend and we think this sort of community driven approach to robotics development is the right way to really unleash the robotics revolution. It has to be digitally protected, so there's physical safety and then the kind of security and privacy of your data, and that obviously has to be

S Speaker 24:49our first generation robot was called Walker. We built this a little over a year and a half ago, a very simple six degree of freedom platform, and at 25 pounds taking its first steps, we were able to very freely and experimentally deploy new policies. And so this kind of let us connect simulation to our own real world hardware. The Astoria generation of hardware extended this to a simple humanoid form, so now capable of more diverse behaviors, crawling, getting up to the ground, recovering from falls. The bleaker generation was the first time we did a real industrial design path. Started incorporating soft materials and then working on what we call compliant control, so a robot that you can easily and freely interact with, push, pull, stays balanced. But then actually, if you look at Diego here, he's going to lift up the leg while it's balancing. And so this, this trade off between capability and safety is not what you necessarily have to make if you train robots in the right way. So we're incorporating that from the ground up into our system. We also added a camera and speaker microphones, you could actually interact with a robot by a voice. It could plan long horizon tasks and interact autonomously with its environment. And then, in May, we built our fourth generation hardware, the Chelsea generation, which was the first that articulated arms and grippers. So we could actually start to do some of the more capability driven manipulation tasks in real environments, but again, underpinned by this approach that is lightweight, safe, interactive,

S Speaker 26:45is, on our fifth generation hardware, we are now making this available to developers. We actually have already put it into some partner cams, and what they get out of the box is not only a hardware system which is soft, lightweight, interactive and capable, but an SDK that includes a bunch of capabilities out of the box so developers don't have to do the kind of heavy lifting of capable and compliant locomotion and diverse motor policies. It comes with autonomous mapping and navigation out of the box. It comes with interactive and engaging design features and
