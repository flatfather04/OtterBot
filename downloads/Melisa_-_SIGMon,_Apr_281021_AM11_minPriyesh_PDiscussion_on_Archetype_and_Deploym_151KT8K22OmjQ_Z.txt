sort of a deployment side. That's very interesting. Melissa, thanks a lot for sharing that. I haven't done a lot of research into them myself here. Just went through the website and a couple of recent blogs that they published. So I will keep you posted on how the product has evolved. Let me get back to you on that. But very interesting. Love that you're also looking at the sector. Those are some very amazing points. Yeah. I mean,

Speaker 1
it's interesting because it sort of seems like there's limitless potential. And then also, I think Priyesh, then also, I think particularly when Jeff and I talk about it, we sort of drop links and exactly what the nearest term potential is. And so that's one aspect. But I think also just within the physical AI space, another thing that's been interesting is when I went to the GTC conference, I sat in on a couple of sort of incumbent non AI companies, and what they were doing with Nvidia. I think one of the areas that we've been really interested in, been really interested in is sort of immediate decision making by the model without having any sort of oversight. And so there's a company just just looking out on the new boat, Aviva, and they work in the oil and gas station, already familiar, but they have put together a full physical animal for a very niche task. But essentially it's sort of valid decision making between one of their refinery plans, and honestly, not a specialist in essays. I don't know how to best explain it, but focusing with use in a video platform and their existing researchers, and they fully deployed the solution. It's fully working physically model. But they themselves say, you know, we're not an AI company, and this is a pretty small application, but we've been rolling it out independently for a couple of our oil and gas customers. And so that, I thought was interesting as well, because I guess I would have never expected that they were already a expected that they were already putting some of these processes in place and putting some of these AI fully working physicality modeling. So I guess that was just another interesting data point we

came across Absolutely. I think later today, that sounds interesting, but sure, I think we've spoken to a few companies recently, one that really comes to my mind, and we wanted to be a part of the seed round as well. Couldn't get allocation there, but it's a company called perceptron. It started be a few medical they raised a seed round, probably would be raising sometime later this year. But that creating a foundation model, similar to the likes of skilled AI, I would say. But their focus, per se, is really to become the first multi modal, I would say, early fusion multimodal model, which means that you can draw relationships between sound and VM, and how does a bird sound, or how does a pre move, and there is fast wind versus when it's conditions and they start to they they're working with some of our portfolio companies in the computer vision area. Really, the model is showing some emergent properties which we haven't seen in any of the other models, I would say, any of the other transformer based models, and think it would power a lot of other applications from computer vision companies are not able to access because there's significant lack of data. But imagine properties and busted frost model probably could solve it. That's pretty interesting. One that I come across, Bessemer took a lot of their rounds, so we couldn't get any allocation there. But hopefully there will be a way around going through. Yeah, that sounds

Speaker 1
super interesting. I think the multimodal component in particular is for interesting. I mean, you honestly haven't taken a really look in the area, but it sounds like it solves a lot, I think the challenges that we've been focusing on and one of the problems that we've been focusing on. And so, yeah, I'm definitely gonna take a look at that after
super interesting. I think the multimodal component in particular is for interesting. I mean, you honestly haven't taken a really look in the area, but it sounds like it solves a lot, I think the challenges that we've been focusing on and one of the problems that we've been focusing on.

Speaker 2
we hop off the call. Yeah, another year that I'm trying to sort of start my research in is, is Earth models in general. I came across a company called Silurian. It was in last year's YC batch. If I'm not wrong, but they're creating, they have a transformative architecture for modeling Earth and their hypothesis is, you have a lot of stratospheric Earth data, you have a lot of emissions data, you have a lot of Earth observation data. How do you sort of build all of this together into a model which you can use to query weather, agriculture imports, extreme weather events cancel to ensure some of the other markets. Seeing a few companies come up in this space, it seems a little bit early, but it's also probably a very interesting upcoming space. So we'll be talking to a few companies in the city as
we hop off the call. Yeah, another year that I'm trying to sort of start my research in is, is Earth models in general. I came across a company called Silurian. It was in last year's YC batch.

Speaker 1
well. Yeah, it's actually interesting that you mentioned that, because I think we had taken a look at a couple of folks that were working on this for more AG, tech years ago, and we didn't really get comfortable with the market or the commercial language, particularly for venture returns, but it seems like in the last year, particularly around the wildfire issues, we've seen a lot of funding rounds for wildfire AI. So it's kind of interesting hearing about this company in particular, because I think being able to apply the foundation model even wider set of problems is extremely intriguing outside of just pure sort of wildfire prevention. And so it makes sense that you're looking there, and kind of curious to see what you are seeing. Because I think when we took a look at some of those models around ag tech earlier on, it just seemed so particular and also challenging to get sort of that insight to action on a farmer basis. And so, yeah, super curious to sort of hear what you end up taking sort of close look out there, because it will be useful. I don't think we've historically made a lot of bets in the space, or it would be a little bit more
well. Yeah, it's actually interesting that you mentioned that, because I think we had taken a look at a couple of folks that were working on this for more AG, tech years ago, and we didn't really get comfortable with the market or the commercial language, particularly for venture returns, but it seems like in the last year, particularly around the wildfire issues, we've seen a lot of funding rounds for wildfire AI.

with the process
Speaker 2
one second. Yeah. So, yeah, good episode with the problem. In fact. Meanwhile, if you come, if you have any thoughts, it seems like you and the team have done a lot of into the space, particularly, and you've been following it for years. So if you have any names for me, any initial insight, we'd love to go through them as well. Definitely,
one second. Yeah. So, yeah, good episode with the problem. In fact.

Speaker 1
I don't know about following for years, you definitely take a look at the thing. But that's always, I think, we keep trying to go back to PCs that we were not ready to invest in at the time and sort of together with them, sort of progress in the last few years. So I'm curious, do you take a look at any I guess another area that we've been looking at, sort of, more on the hardware side, is alternative memory. And so I think particularly around replacing DRAM, I think we took a look a couple years ago, felt like it was probably unlikely, and now we're taking another look at it. And so we've spoken to a couple companies that are doing different sort of versions of kind of more advanced SRAM, or just alternative sort of SRAM hvM type technologies. And honestly, the supply chain, and I think a little bit of the purchasing power is a challenge for us, but we're currently taking those are just curious. If you all are interested in that area, kind of see it as the pipe dream, maybe. Yeah, personally,
I don't know about following for years, you definitely take a look at the thing.

myself, I haven't been looking at that space. I don't think I have the right skill set to evaluate a hardware company. But yes, members of my team are excited about that space. I We have a partner too. She's looking at a lot of data technologies, a lot of FBT technologies. So I think it's adjacent to that to some extent. If Melissa is of interest, happy to connect you to her, if you can send me a blog or something, happy to use that in Connecticut, maybe it could be a valid conversation. Yeah,

Speaker 1
that would be, that would be wonderful. And I can definitely send over a little bit more background on work and our expertise there. And I think even, even just sort of bouncing around early ideas, and if it's of interest, you all are obviously a lot
that would be, that would be wonderful. And I can definitely send over a little bit more background on work and our expertise there. And I think even, even just sort of bouncing around early ideas, and if it's of interest, you all are obviously a lot

that we've been looking at. So I think, I guess one other sort of company that has recently come up more so on the automotive side. Have you taken a look at atomic Industries at all. I think they're doing sort of automated tool and die. I don't know if it's an area within your your all sort of robotics thesis that you would consider, but that's one that comes around.

I'll have to take a look. But it does automobiles, usually what we are able to make a case for anything which is a technology stack related automobiles, because a lot of our chip stores and Adas platforms for most of the automobile manufacturers. So we can create a story towards the strategic filter, but we'll take a look at this company. I

Speaker 1
don't think I've heard about them. Yeah, we're really intrigued by them, I think because it combines a little bit of the physical AI thesis with sort of a near term application. But we haven't spoken to them yet. We've they had closed a funding round when we had first come across them, and so we've sort of just been monitoring, but have a little bit of sort of curiosity around them as well. Because I think some of the challenges we got with the we got into with the robot arm OS is that it just needed an immediate application. I think the focus for the company we had invested in at the time was, I think four years in, they did sort of a full focus on welding, and so that was sort of the entry ground atomic industries. Because I'm sort of curious if their model is actually a lot more in general and can be applied in sort of other areas, and it's sort of the first applications, just around the tool and die, or if it's sort of the before full piece for them. So I don't have an answer for
don't think I've heard about them. Yeah, we're really intrigued by them, I think because it combines a little bit of the physical AI thesis with sort of a near term application.

that, but I think that's where a lot of our interests there.

Yeah, it's extremely stealthy, still, I think, Okay, well, it was wonderful catching up. And I'll sure send over just on I'll go back through our notes on some of the models that we took out on sort of the earth based data, and see if there's anything useful there.

my multiple pages of docs. And if there are any UCLA events, I'd love to attend them, for sure. Let me get you connected to some people there. Okay, sounds great. Hope you have a great rest of the week, and hopefully it's there's plenty of time to slow down a little bit. I have been events pretty much the entire right? Well,

great catching up, Melissa. Let's
great catching up, Melissa. Let's
great catching up, Melissa. Let's
great catching up, Melissa. Let's
do this sometime
Speaker 1
Speaker 2
sort of a deployment side. That's very interesting. Melissa, thanks a lot for sharing that. I haven't done a lot of research into them myself here. Just went through the website and a couple of recent blogs that they published. So I will keep you posted on how the product has evolved. Let me get back to you on that. But very interesting. Love that you're also looking at the sector. Those are some very amazing points. Yeah. I mean,
Speaker 1
it's interesting because it sort of seems like there's limitless potential. And then also, I think Priyesh, then also, I think particularly when Jeff and I talk about it, we sort of drop links and exactly what the nearest term potential is. And so that's one aspect. But I think also just within the physical AI space, another thing that's been interesting is when I went to the GTC conference, I sat in on a couple of sort of incumbent non AI companies, and what they were doing with Nvidia. I think one of the areas that we've been really interested in, been really interested in is sort of immediate decision making by the model without having any sort of oversight. And so there's a company just just looking out on the new boat, Aviva, and they work in the oil and gas station, already familiar, but they have put together a full physical animal for a very niche task. But essentially it's sort of valid decision making between one of their refinery plans, and honestly, not a specialist in essays. I don't know how to best explain it, but focusing with use in a video platform and their existing researchers, and they fully deployed the solution. It's fully working physically model. But they themselves say, you know, we're not an AI company, and this is a pretty small application, but we've been rolling it out independently for a couple of our oil and gas customers. And so that, I thought was interesting as well, because I guess I would have never expected that they were already a expected that they were already putting some of these processes in place and putting some of these AI fully working physicality modeling. So I guess that was just another interesting data point we
Speaker 2
came across Absolutely. I think later today, that sounds interesting, but sure, I think we've spoken to a few companies recently, one that really comes to my mind, and we wanted to be a part of the seed round as well. Couldn't get allocation there, but it's a company called perceptron. It started be a few medical they raised a seed round, probably would be raising sometime later this year. But that creating a foundation model, similar to the likes of skilled AI, I would say. But their focus, per se, is really to become the first multi modal, I would say, early fusion multimodal model, which means that you can draw relationships between sound and VM, and how does a bird sound, or how does a pre move, and there is fast wind versus when it's conditions and they start to they they're working with some of our portfolio companies in the computer vision area. Really, the model is showing some emergent properties which we haven't seen in any of the other models, I would say, any of the other transformer based models, and think it would power a lot of other applications from computer vision companies are not able to access because there's significant lack of data. But imagine properties and busted frost model probably could solve it. That's pretty interesting. One that I come across, Bessemer took a lot of their rounds, so we couldn't get any allocation there. But hopefully there will be a way around going through. Yeah, that sounds
Speaker 1
super interesting. I think the multimodal component in particular is for interesting. I mean, you honestly haven't taken a really look in the area, but it sounds like it solves a lot, I think the challenges that we've been focusing on and one of the problems that we've been focusing on. And so, yeah, I'm definitely gonna take a look at that after
Speaker 2
we hop off the call. Yeah, another year that I'm trying to sort of start my research in is, is Earth models in general. I came across a company called Silurian. It was in last year's YC batch. If I'm not wrong, but they're creating, they have a transformative architecture for modeling Earth and their hypothesis is, you have a lot of stratospheric Earth data, you have a lot of emissions data, you have a lot of Earth observation data. How do you sort of build all of this together into a model which you can use to query weather, agriculture imports, extreme weather events cancel to ensure some of the other markets. Seeing a few companies come up in this space, it seems a little bit early, but it's also probably a very interesting upcoming space. So we'll be talking to a few companies in the city as
Speaker 1
well. Yeah, it's actually interesting that you mentioned that, because I think we had taken a look at a couple of folks that were working on this for more AG, tech years ago, and we didn't really get comfortable with the market or the commercial language, particularly for venture returns, but it seems like in the last year, particularly around the wildfire issues, we've seen a lot of funding rounds for wildfire AI. So it's kind of interesting hearing about this company in particular, because I think being able to apply the foundation model even wider set of problems is extremely intriguing outside of just pure sort of wildfire prevention. And so it makes sense that you're looking there, and kind of curious to see what you are seeing. Because I think when we took a look at some of those models around ag tech earlier on, it just seemed so particular and also challenging to get sort of that insight to action on a farmer basis. And so, yeah, super curious to sort of hear what you end up taking sort of close look out there, because it will be useful. I don't think we've historically made a lot of bets in the space, or it would be a little bit more
Speaker 2
hardware focused, but interesting. My notes when I'm through
with the process
Speaker 2
one second. Yeah. So, yeah, good episode with the problem. In fact. Meanwhile, if you come, if you have any thoughts, it seems like you and the team have done a lot of into the space, particularly, and you've been following it for years. So if you have any names for me, any initial insight, we'd love to go through them as well. Definitely,
Speaker 1
I don't know about following for years, you definitely take a look at the thing. But that's always, I think, we keep trying to go back to PCs that we were not ready to invest in at the time and sort of together with them, sort of progress in the last few years. So I'm curious, do you take a look at any I guess another area that we've been looking at, sort of, more on the hardware side, is alternative memory. And so I think particularly around replacing DRAM, I think we took a look a couple years ago, felt like it was probably unlikely, and now we're taking another look at it. And so we've spoken to a couple companies that are doing different sort of versions of kind of more advanced SRAM, or just alternative sort of SRAM hvM type technologies. And honestly, the supply chain, and I think a little bit of the purchasing power is a challenge for us, but we're currently taking those are just curious. If you all are interested in that area, kind of see it as the pipe dream, maybe. Yeah, personally,
Speaker 2
myself, I haven't been looking at that space. I don't think I have the right skill set to evaluate a hardware company. But yes, members of my team are excited about that space. I We have a partner too. She's looking at a lot of data technologies, a lot of FBT technologies. So I think it's adjacent to that to some extent. If Melissa is of interest, happy to connect you to her, if you can send me a blog or something, happy to use that in Connecticut, maybe it could be a valid conversation. Yeah,
Speaker 1
that would be, that would be wonderful. And I can definitely send over a little bit more background on work and our expertise there. And I think even, even just sort of bouncing around early ideas, and if it's of interest, you all are obviously a lot
Speaker 2
more technically we you get to use the call concentrating, yes, largely, sort of the areas
Speaker 1
that we've been looking at. So I think, I guess one other sort of company that has recently come up more so on the automotive side. Have you taken a look at atomic Industries at all. I think they're doing sort of automated tool and die. I don't know if it's an area within your your all sort of robotics thesis that you would consider, but that's one that comes around.
Speaker 2
I'll have to take a look. But it does automobiles, usually what we are able to make a case for anything which is a technology stack related automobiles, because a lot of our chip stores and Adas platforms for most of the automobile manufacturers. So we can create a story towards the strategic filter, but we'll take a look at this company. I
Speaker 1
don't think I've heard about them. Yeah, we're really intrigued by them, I think because it combines a little bit of the physical AI thesis with sort of a near term application. But we haven't spoken to them yet. We've they had closed a funding round when we had first come across them, and so we've sort of just been monitoring, but have a little bit of sort of curiosity around them as well.

Because I'm sort of curious if their model is actually a lot more in general and can be applied in sort of other areas, and it's sort of the first applications, just around the tool and die, or if it's sort of the before full piece for them. So I don't have an answer for
that, but I think that's where a lot of our interests there.
Speaker 2
Yeah, it really seems interesting. I cannot see a lot on their website, so I'll reach out to them. I'll let you know if I do get connected to them and speak to them.
Speaker 1
Yeah, it's extremely stealthy, still, I think, Okay, well, it was wonderful catching up. And I'll sure send over just on I'll go back through our notes on some of the models that we took out on sort of the earth based data, and see if there's anything useful there. And also send a little bit of background on our work in the hardware space on the
Speaker 2
Speaker 1
my multiple pages of docs. And if there are any UCLA events, I'd love to attend them, for sure. Let me get you connected to some people there. Okay, sounds great. Hope you have a great rest of the week, and hopefully it's there's plenty of time to slow down a little bit. I have been events pretty much the entire right? Well,
great catching up, Melissa. Let's
do this sometime
again, soon.
