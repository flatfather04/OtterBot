So Harry, I'm a Senior Associate here in Qualcomm ventures. I've been with the Fund for about two years. Prior to that, I've spent some time working with Menlo Ventures and Morpheus ventures in LA so I did my MBA from UCLA, and I've spent a couple of years there

S Speaker 24:17Yeah, we were just doing introductions right now. I was about to give Harry a brief introduction about the fund as well. So Harry, we are very stage agnostic in our approach. We have done early stage rounds in seed for for a check size of, say, as low as $2 million and then we have also done very late pre IPO rounds, but check sizes of up to $15 million so very stage agnostic from that front, we're the corporate venture arm of Qualcomm. So we invest out of the balance sheet and typically aim to work with some of our prospects and portfolio companies across GTM, engineering partnerships, ecosystem players and things like that. Anything specific that I can mention about the fund?

S Speaker 25:08Segment as well? Harry, so we give given we are the strategic arm of Qualcomm. So anywhere where there is an angle of compute and connectivity in AI that gives us a very broad surface area, because you can imagine Qualcomm's platform is now in mobile to PCs to a data center play, XR wearables. So gives us a very wide spectrum of areas in AI, some notable investments that we have are in anthropic hugging, face weights and biases in mlops play. And then we have recently made a few vertical AI investments as well in Crestor, which is BPO automation, another company called context, which is a Knowledge Center, knowledge workflow automation and things like that.

Started my internet career at a company called Overture, which was the pioneer of sponsored search. So it's basically like Google AdWords, right? Yahoo ultimately bought our company, so over there, and that's where I learned about advertising. And I started my business was $10,000 in 2002

S Speaker 118:16yeah, great job. So you had several questions in there, so let me try to answer some of them. So this is a little bit like the search space all over again, right when Google came on the market. The difference today is for those of us like myself, who are in it every day, who have commercial reasons to pick and choose models. What the

S Speaker 118:50Google had a absolute technical advantage in search algorithm when they when they launched, and I would say, when they launched, 26 years ago, even till today, Google still has a a algorithmic advantage, right? However, in the in the AI space, I no longer think that open AI will win the game. Okay, I keep track of all the models, all the great models are coming out of open source and mostly through China, and they're open sourcing it, hosting it domestically, charging almost nothing, right? Like for colo, I am literally driving my cost down to, like, 10% of what what I used to pay. So it is no longer. It's not a case where you are downgrading your quality, but you're actually upgrading your quality and lowering your cost at the same time. So what does that mean in the future? That means there will not be a dominant player like a Google in this space. There will be many, many smaller players, who is fragmented, right? People who are able to create unique use cases that take a portion of that space, right? So it could be a colo actually does AI, but it's got messaging, right? Colo does AI, but it's got, you know, celebrity moms like Jennifer Garner pushing this right. So imagine a world where perplexity, you know, open AI may have 60% of the market, and their perplexity gets 5% and then, like, yeah, x will have five, 10% and then, like, there might be Jennifer Gardner's colo AI with 2% but like it's, I think it's very fragmented, because the quality is going to be just as good or better. So this is a very different market now,

S Speaker 121:13That is one mode, right? That is one mold that is unique today. I do not anticipate everybody to sit on their ass and do nothing, because this is a, this is a unique use case that we've come up with, but I totally anticipate everybody to be doing some kind of group chat, because it is powerful, right? It could be, you know, it could be an enterprise version in the future, but I see everybody doing it, but I think, I do think ultimately it is whoever is going to be able to get users, right there a couple of companies that does a lot of the text based AI. Text AI being one of them. There's a company called continua, I will tell you this. I think text AI launched something like in April of this year, right? Which means they've had five months or five months ahead of us. They have released, like the volume of messages they sent, and we are absolutely crushing them. Okay, I don't believe continua has any momentum whatsoever. So, you know, as far as text based solutions go, I'm pretty damn sure we're number one now, okay, and, and, what other questions did you have the modes? Yeah, the modes are just, you know, I think everybody will ultimately have different modes. We just have chosen the messaging as the mode that we want to attack, and that's proven very, very effective for us. We spent nothing on marketing, and it's gone viral. It's like almost doubles, you know, goes go by 3040, 50% by the week, our users are highly active. I think on a weekly basis, about 90% of the users are still active. Oh, another very interesting fact here is the average user is sending us 20 messages a day, or 20 questions a day. This is like, if you compare to Google search. Google does 4.3 searches a day. Okay, so there's their magnitude more, more, I guess, addicted or engaged.

S Speaker 223:38Harry, so when, when text AI did their YC launch. I used the platform. I, in fact, also use a couple of other platforms which are text based in their AI distribution. For me personally, it's the same sort of opening a WhatsApp and a contact and texting that AI bot, versus opening an AI app, like a chat GPT and using that so in forms of distribution. While I agree text is a good mode, unless you have a lot of integrations and a very long memory, which I know you mentioned in your deck, I don't see myself using that. So what? What are you working on in terms of memory integration and making the platform more proactive in that sense?

Interesting, Android. Okay, all
S Speaker 126:39right, so, okay, why do you say because we are, we are. We were going to launch yesterday. We're going to launch today, a iMessage version of colo, which is exponentially faster. It is, like, incredibly fast. It might work well on Android too, but that was not the intent.

S Speaker 227:02I did try the Android version of kolo Harry. It was, it was it worked. Well, I don't think latency was a problem for me. Do you plan to do any form of on device inferencing? I'm sorry, what do you plan to run any of your AI workloads on device?
I did try the Android version of kolo Harry. It was, it was it worked. Well, I don't think latency was a problem for me. Do you plan to do any form of on device inferencing? I'm sorry, what do you plan to run any of your AI workloads on device?

S Speaker 127:22Yeah, you know, we haven't even considered that, but we probably should, because it's there's probably a lot of privacy, things that people would not want right on the in the cloud that should be stored on device, probably AI calculations that can happen on device that doesn't need the cloud, right? And I don't know what the capacity is at this point, and I think that's where you guys are strong, right?
Yeah, you know, we haven't even considered that, but we probably should, because it's there's probably a lot of privacy, things that people would not want right on the in the cloud that should be stored on device, probably AI calculations that can happen on device that doesn't need the cloud, right?

S Speaker 427:52That would be a good point of introduction. Priyesh, your side, yeah, both on the on the phone as well as on the PC side. Harry, I
That would be a good point of introduction. Priyesh, your side, yeah, both on the on the phone as well as on the PC side. Harry, I
That would be a good point of introduction. Priyesh, your side, yeah, both on the on the phone as well as on the PC side. Harry, I
That would be a good point of introduction. Priyesh, your side, yeah, both on the on the phone as well as on the PC side. Harry, I
S Speaker 128:02wonder, like, does the chip have anything to do with authentic like, is there something we can do to authenticate users with Qualcomm chips, or this all processing?
wonder, like, does the chip have anything to do with authentic like, is there something we can do to authenticate users with Qualcomm chips, or this all processing?

wonder, like, does the chip have anything to do with authentic like, is there something we can do to authenticate users with Qualcomm chips, or this all processing?
S Speaker 428:15There are a couple of things you could look at, Harry, so authentication can be possible. And the second one is, we have an NPU on on the phone as well as on the PC, and so that's what Priyesh was referring to as a way to do some of the inference work on the device. Priyeshh, we're going to add something

S Speaker 128:52Yeah, okay, well, I think, I think we might be running out of time so, and I want to be conscious of your time. What do you guys want to talk about it internally, see if there's interest, and come back to me. Yeah,
Yeah, okay, well, I think, I think we might be running out of time so, and I want to be conscious of your time. What do you guys want to talk about it internally, see if there's interest, and come back to me. Yeah,

S Speaker 429:07I think that's that makes sense, and Priyesh will be in touch. What is the timing of your round?
I think that's that makes sense, and Priyesh will be in touch. What is the timing of your round?
I think that's that makes sense, and Priyesh will be in touch. What is the timing of your round?
I think that's that makes sense, and Priyesh will be in touch. What is the timing of your round?
S Speaker 129:12Harry, yeah, we're we were trying to close by, I would say mid December. They know, people are already signing the note. And if you want to participate as a note, we are starting to fill the 3 million you could, you could be the lead, or you can participate in the note. You know, just happy to, you know, my, my perspective on investor is, I'm happy to participate with any investor who has value to add in some way, right, one way or another. And, you know, yeah, great size check is a good big check. Size is always great. But you know, also the right person right or the right lead and and just having fun doing it right. Because, you know, we all know that business is hard. The only thing that I have going for me is I've just created multiple successful businesses. So I figured out a way. I figured out how to work through issues. Because, you know, anybody who says this is my business plan, I'm going this way only is going to be pretty foolish, because it's always like this, right? So I always figure out, like, ultimately, how to how to succeed. So we'd love to have you guys come in and participate in some

S Speaker 130:37This is, this is kind of funny. LVMH is seriously taking a look at this light speed, not light speed a general catalyst. Really wanted to do it, but they want to see us get bigger and write a bigger check. So there, I guess they will be a good candidate A little later on. I think this is where like we are. We are like this little now, I think once Jennifer starts promoting it, this is where it's going to go big, and we're just wrapping up for that.
