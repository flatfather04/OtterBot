S Speaker 21:53interesting man. I'm not sure if you use to follow manga or not mela mangonia thorough but a lot of people in our batch. I was always curious that maybe just converting those manga into animations could be now very easier but like that's

S Speaker 25:20I'd say these guys like Besame or Sequoia XL Lightspeed who was like all these days Y Combinator is almost everywhere. Y Combinator que nosotros the nature of the head is like that. Like they they are doing AI deals everywhere and seems like they are in all the cap tables. So these guys general catalyst to capital Founders Fund. So there's like a pecking order means tier one VCs, then tier one corporate venture, where Qualcomm Microsoft and video Google few other ventures come in. Then this tier two, tier three is

S Speaker 26:45I realize it's very geography dependent as well like SF mates like that. But if there are like companies in Boston it will be the Boston fans who will get them first New York May the same Chicago Mayor same so la maybe I've seen that happen. So I think it's very geography dependent as well as Texas and Miami coming in. But around the series thing. What happened recently, bro is here at least the multi stage funds they have very consciously decided to go very early. Like especially in AI deals what is happening is a lot of these funds like us as well, we would invest in series A by the time we'll have some indications on revenue and good metrics to make our decision. But the valuation is not the inflator theoretical key, it's not making sense at all. And even in Series A, what is happening is CDL or race car later when they they're just a team and they have let's say a research paper out that will build a foundation model around these lines. And there's not even a product at that point C two is clearly a will be by high valuation, but then by the time series A comes, they have launched their first model and it booms up. So we again, like I think last couple of weeks, I was working on this thesis on what a lot of funds are doing here. And should we be starting a seed program so now we have like decided making about five seven seed investments to millions per year do million per check, kind of thing about 14 to $15 $15 million per year. So exceed program Kitara. We are trying to do this experiment seeing if this works out in this current scenario. If we do not write C checks by the time they come to us for a Series A it's already too expensive.

S Speaker 18:33Yeah, I think that's a fair assessment. I think especially in software companies. Like you know, what we see you start to reach out much later progress, but they don't want to read it either. So, that is that is so we have always been you know very vertically integrated. So I think for us it's good. Whatever catches your eye like how's the sacrament like are people still like super excited about doing everything they like put us all together right now.
Yeah, I think that's a fair assessment. I think especially in software companies. Like you know, what we see you start to reach out much later progress, but they don't want to read it either.

S Speaker 29:11Yeah, that is still excitement. I think. Now people have started understanding that a lot of vertical AI plays is getting crowded. So there are hundreds of companies in sales, customer experience, and that analysis of that data using generative AI and big bets almost everyone has made a bet around that and these companies are doing good but it's become very crowded. Similarly for finance, healthcare, these industries are getting overburdened with a lot of vertical plays to people are becoming more cautious of making plays around that. Then similarly for enterprise search, like managing the entire enterprise data and you just query LM to find that sorry. Exactly. to glean was me again name company. With the I forgetting that name.

S Speaker 210:22Indian company but yes. Like crested in us building for the US. One of our partners we're tracking and she was in India previously. So similar thing, not a lot of differentiation. Everything is about go to market who is going to sell first who is going to make it stick kind of thing.

S Speaker 113:29Very interesting. I know. So basically, we also like you know, I was reading about some of these new architectures I think they will this map architecture. Also, kind of the comparative to transformers, but yeah, very cool. To see like, you know how you are just come and replace Trump properly possible.

S Speaker 213:52Yeah, if nothing. One can be Shirky right now, if you buy the right team and they are able to launch a model. Secondary may be you will be able to get an exit they even if it does not become a successful business. The hype itself is so real that you will be able to find an exit before the company dies out. Yeah.

S Speaker 114:25couple of quarters collapse we We're about to get a company right now. We're not seeing and I was thinking like what's going on in their companies because obviously the security piece are just gonna come like conventional models from scratch. There are a couple here, but again, they have a very specific area they are basically building entry level languages. So, those kind of case we are seeing in the model year but to start off in applications I think we are looking to see what applications are geared towards when market and SMB is coming out of the box. That rectangle can you basically go and sell to these small business owners, sorry small business owners as a hobby. People are finding different verticals. So let's say complaint monitors for a small insurance company companies as far as like, you know, independent practices for dentists that is absurd occurrences. So was there any obligation to our degree, and I completely agree with you that economic enterprise I think it should not lead to any vertical sales marketing or spa product. So even we are like you're kind of shying away from that. And the second area where we see more companies is in that gap schooling, but the hobby everything is so early, that I have not score like you know, for example, there's this company called bowtie that is particular AI coordinated. So, their hypothesis is that like you know, the model and client sites when you know will basically become fragmented, either there will be one client of two different models or there will be like the same model and hence later you will need something better to add a good feeling.

S Speaker 116:37running up your bill, but it does take you know, 1/3 of teachers are all observability then I think led to the entire model. So like this kind of query is going to be similar to this and open AI topic and so on. And then making the we can also add a layer of security on top your block injection attacks or any of the troubles kind of data leakage model jailbreak attempts. So I think these kind of tools are coming up. We are seeing a lot of companies and security as well who are trying to basically like you know, identify patterns for our model. Okay, like physically this will make the model PII data. So those kinds of things, but it's also very early, and I don't know that you know, what is the right to win? The entire research taken upon our city in the US.

The bunch of companies that you're doing stuff you're super convincing, even though there wasn't all that they have. They will be very specific cases, but does not make it so it voice I think we only have three guys are preparing for this like robot generation, which is similar to 11 labs where they put like a synthetic voice in relationship by using a sample set and we are seeing a lot of voice analytics companies so they have like, you know, text to speech to text and then on top of that we have LLM so to do a lot of like, you know, analytic stuff on that voice recording. And then third is basically all the intuitive ways that can you approximate that is our customer support interaction. That's one but this one is like very God. First of all, we are still Legos in some companies, but not many people have had a very convincing solution. And then when to be photographed that becomes readily available.

S Speaker 120:45one of them. Our company is called CamStudio. They were trying to build a voice to voice model so that their entire hypothesis was that like, you know, a voice of voice model to be paid more efficient than a multi modal model. It will also be smaller and cheaper. And then this was the voice only can can serve as a base for a lot of these like your voice power applications. But they were looking to raise but after like a lot the Gemini launch I think there are very few takers because everybody believes that like this entire use case will be subsumed. By large multimodal monitors.

S Speaker 221:19Yeah. Interesting. I'm seeing a few sort of these voice. Like, apart from the three Norberg that you mentioned, there are a few companies, which act as a voice interface. And then have a very strong, or at least they claim to have a very strong agentic workflow following that. So let's say for a restaurant, this API will take your calls, it will act as a normal human caller. But beyond that, data analysis Kirche CRM Madala per se, inventory management Baga is supply chain management. And then they automate a lot of these things. Like I am supposed to really understand the space see how this goes. So I'll be researching on it probably in the next couple of weeks creating a thesis of my own on that and then based on that they would love to have your thoughts on

S Speaker 122:30And this lien also, there might have been a company that didn't think of those pieces. Well, it's called a newspaper. I thought it was a small collection for us. But they are like two kids from India now based in the Bay Area. They are trying to like you know build general purpose events based on the browser, but for Happy learning from them was that the decision making like material comes out of the lens, the lens or not putting these things out, you can have let's say 99.99% success rate on those. So it will make it a work like nine out of 10 times, which is not good for most business use cases. It may be good for your personal use cases. More reliability. So I think that's like according to them, that's what's been going like you know the adoption of agents. So that there are a few companies who are trying to like come with more scaffolding around it like no write more code to it. But then that again defeats the purpose right so again, like to pick up like more deterministic and more tightly coupled to it. Yeah,

S Speaker 223:35that makes a lot of sense. I totally understand our way mutual Agra because there are a lot of these agenti companies coming in mostly consumer right now or prosumer. If you'd say there is this one company, Agent ops, they are trying to be the observability monitor live monitoring platform for all the agentic workflows. So I could only find this one company trying to be the ML ops player for agent and maybe this could be when I'm monitoring them speaking to them next week. They take as an example but yeah, I'm excited about this one.

S Speaker 224:27I came across one semiconductor company in India, someone called outreached to me, wasn't as exciting to Qualcomm. So we passed on that. But nothing apart from that. I'm supposed to catch up with this one guy who was building electric vehicles in India. I sort of worked with him for a couple of months before starting my MBA. Planet Electric is the company. His thesis is that he comes from Israel and his thesis is that a lot of materials used in

S Speaker 225:04wind turbines are candlelight with the body chassis of a car significantly. So without any advancements in battery or engine or anything else. You still get superior performance closer to a Tesla at probably 1/5 The price. So he was working on that he needed to raise a lot of capital, probably a couple of million dollars to just build out a hyper prototype, which wasn't working well for him but he raised I think probably last quarter has now built a prototype and he was running that around need to catch up with him see how things are going with him Yeah, and then there's this one kid bro like maybe down the line when it when the time is right I'd connect you to him. And he would appreciate some feedback or mentoring around this. This guy is from IIT Madras and he's trying to build in the energy space right now. He's exploring a lot of he was with me at lean mass when I was working in that energy transition company and he's exploring a lot of things. Really driven guy. I think he would and his mass market. He would probably come up with something but right now it's just an exploration phase trying to validate a lot of ideas, working with his dad's money to keep himself alive and doing all of those things.

S Speaker 226:39I also came across this couple of days that I went recently this company is called human AGI IIT Delhi grad and he recently moved to the way like he is shuffling between India and B. His team is in India, the Alta entire engineering team. They are doing AI alignment for these chat bots right now. So on one hand, they work with specific customer data, and then they align an LLM output to that. Supposed to talk to him. I was supposed to follow up with him and see what exactly is building. But the team looks good. This guy looks good and I think he had a previous exit as well. This person, Nikhil if I'm not wrong, I'm connected to him. On Linden when he went into here

28:15It's actually called Future AGI my bad LinkedIn
S Speaker 128:27you also come across more Indian founders because honestly what is happening is that you know, we know India, there are a lot of companies in AI as I was telling you to applications, but we know that the threat of that will be very, very high. And people who are based in the US when you will the US will have a clear right to it. So obviously like you know that's why we are slowly expanding our focus to Congress in the US as well. Because they're like, you know, we can have like a strong connection because, like let's say they connect and they will be the top of vendors

S Speaker 229:24Russell you do you mean like Indians who are an American Indian Americans as well? Even Americans? Certainly I think the brain drain situation is real. I do see a lot of founders from India. At least one in the founding team is an Indian researcher working at Cornell or Stanford, graduating out of one of the computer labs and then starting a company. So before that, I'll keep sending them to you whenever I come across them.
