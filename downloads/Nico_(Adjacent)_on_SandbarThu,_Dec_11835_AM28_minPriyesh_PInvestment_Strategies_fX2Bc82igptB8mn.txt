S Speaker 10:14It also meant that I pooled the money with some of CO investors that were in control, I appreciate, but I pulled the money with some friends of mine that we invested together. But it might that was not in control of the stake. And so we ended up selling it, you know, at Not, not that early, but like, you know, still, like a few billion dollars valuation, but like, I would have loved to just, you know, be, be a part of it for longer. But then, you know, like, on the bright side, I think I don't know if sample would happen if I had not, you know, if I actually had made the mistake, had the investment had made the investment from fund one? So, you know, sometimes it takes a while to understand how, why things happen the way that they are. But that that was a, you know, yeah, one of the ways that I looked at the company was that I think that this is the natural evolution of the form factor.

S Speaker 21:07That's great. Yeah, congrats. That's a fantastic set of investments. We've been in this space for a number of years too. Unfortunately, we missed aura in the early days. But love the space. Not afraid to be early as well. We were early in Fitbit and others, yeah, new form factors, humane as well. So you're obviously not afraid to be kind of

S Speaker 32:12hardware, it's smart devices, yeah, smartphones and and then there's lots of other devices, right? Like there's, there's IoT devices. Even aura uses our chips. And all the consumer devices that you can think of, they use our platforms, right whether it's connectivity and if you have compute, then more likely, if it's a power constrained device, there's very high that you're going to use our chest, so we do spend a lot of time there. But like Rich mentioned, our experience in general has been a mixed experience, just because early comes with risk, consumer comes with risk, more specifically for AI devices, these next batch of AI that are getting born. Of course, we wanted to take a bet in that space when humane was born, and I know why humane failed, it's mostly timing. They when they launched device. Now, granted, the first device had a whole bunch of issues, but the biggest challenge was that the when they launched AI was not there. They rushed it. No, they did not rush it. They, in fact, delayed it. It's just that these things around timing when, when they started the company, they thought that AI would be at certain place when they would launch. And in fact, there were delays. And even after the delays, AI wasn't there for a voice like experience, we were still dealing with high levels of hallucination and and for a lot of consumer use cases, you they just don't have the, you know, you don't have the same level, especially if it's a voice interaction device, at the same level of patience that you do with,
hardware, it's smart devices, yeah, smartphones and and then there's lots of other devices, right? Like there's, there's IoT devices. Even aura uses our chips.

4:06you know, with text.
S Speaker 34:08So it's a different modality. And then there's, like, lot of learnings in that space. And then since then, we've been watching some of the other devices that have been launched. And, you know, like we recently saw limitless, got acquired. And it was, I know it seems it was small acquisition might matter. And then you heard rumors of open AI, building something with Johnny, I've and everybody, right. How are you thinking about Niko, which is you've got the large players that are going to, obviously launch some devices, open AI included, and and then Google, who's got a hardware division, they will probably launch some AI device as well. And then you've got the other guys, such as aura

4:58people who already have rings. Yeah,

S Speaker 15:16a big question, and I tend to think in probability, so obviously, I don't have, you know, the concrete answer and, but I think I, what I can say is that I really like and, and put a lot of weight on the factors that make, make sandbar well positioned here, I think. And so I like the for me, I've, I'm, I don't know if I'm simple, but, like I do, think that it's very important for the companies that go after these opportunities to position themselves in a way that lends itself to mainstream adoption, right? Because in my views, there are certain things that that that tech people don't understand enough about the nuance of how culture moves, and I think that a lot of the big tech companies suffer from that, and that is fine, and that, you know, like they can still launch successful hardware. But for me, I was always the way that I invest is always with an eye on like. Do I think that this like, from a like psychology and stigma perspective, also lends itself to actual mainstream adoption, and in this case, I think sandbar does, and especially because of the way that they're starting as you know, I don't think it has to stay this way forever, but like I think for now, the voice only, no screen, no camera, positioning is actually very, very strategically important for adoption of the mainstream market and building trust and building positioning that lends itself to be expanded across different product categories over time, but starts not prying into privacy concerns and people that maybe do not want to be captured. And this extends not just to the decisions that they made on the features and the media that they launched with, but also on the gestures that are required to send a signal to people that something is happening. So it's like, I think that so the I guess it comes back to the decisions that they have made, even though, obviously we're still early in the product development, but I think you can see from what they've put into it so far. And this is true for which is also very unique, true for both kirak and famina. I don't know if you spend much time with the CTO, but I was very impressed by his philosophical view of technology, which is very unusual for someone that's also very strong technically, right? It's a very, very well rounded set of skills within two people. And so I think that, for me, was like, so it comes back to, you know, the team, you know, I kind of expanded to that, but it's a team, and it's the decisions that they make that give me confidence, that they understand how to bring new technologies to a mainstream audience. And so the ring, I think, is an amazing first form factor because of my, you know, I'm still wearing the auto ring for six years. Now, even though I'm no longer an investor, I really believe in it. I think we can do a lot of the health metrics as well. Maybe, you know, not 100% but like 20% of that, 80% of value. But I think that the form factor is already proven. I think that the decisions they've made on how to integrate AI in a way that is doesn't, you know, doesn't conflict privacy concerns. It seems to me, quite, you know, lends itself to how to mark enter a market with a new technology. Gives me a lot of confidence that they will also lend that same, you know, philosophy and approach to translating between, like frontier AI technology and like, what actually is acceptable today for future product iterations. So this is, like, it's, it's a very, you know, like, I think you get it, but like, it's really more the philosophical view of how they approach it, and and that I can just have a strong, I have a strong intuition that this is something that can really fly in the mainstream
a big question, and I tend to think in probability, so obviously, I don't have, you know, the concrete answer and, but I think I, what I can say is that I really like and, and put a lot of weight on the factors that make, make sandbar well positioned here, I think.

market. Interesting. And, yeah,
S Speaker 29:19I was gonna ask it, you know, kind of a similar, maybe adjacent question, then I've been pretty impressed by me as well. He seems to be very flexible. And I think part of the genesis of the question around, what does it take to be a true conversational interface? AI interface in this space, we've seen kind of hardware companies succeed and fail, both coming from different places. But, you know, sandbar is starting from a fairly discrete use case, right? Not really kind of going after big mainstream adoption, if you kind of, like, rewind it back, you know, 10 years to Fitbit, they started with a pedometer. It actually wasn't as good as a lot of things on the market, right? Eugene, Michael, you know, who had his company pebble back in the day, more by itself, really, kind of nailing that use case, but didn't have that mainstream scale. But then you had like aura around, you know, health and wellness, they started with a very tight use case and slowly expanded over time. So, like, you know, where do you start? You start from, like, you know, the deep end and go after mass consumer, or do you start really specific and target a hardcore use case abilities over time?
I was gonna ask it, you know, kind of a similar, maybe adjacent question, then I've been pretty impressed by me as well. He seems to be very flexible. And I think part of the genesis of the question around, what does it take to be a true conversational interface? AI interface in this space, we've seen kind of hardware companies succeed and fail, both coming from different places. But, you know, sandbar is starting from a fairly discrete use case, right? Not really kind of going after big mainstream adoption, if you kind of, like, rewind it back, you know, 10 years to Fitbit, they started with a pedometer.

12:00Yeah, I can see that.
Yeah, I can see that.
Yeah, I can see that.
Yeah, I can see that.
12:06No, go ahead. Yeah. I think
No, go ahead. Yeah. I think
No, go ahead. Yeah. I think
No, go ahead. Yeah. I think
S Speaker 312:08this question, the big question will be the I understand, actually, with this form factor, you're not trying to reinvent something new. This form factor is accepted already, and yes, there's aura and ultra human and Samsung ring and, yeah, people. And then now you're adding a different functionality, not a new they don't, kind of have health care,

S Speaker 112:37no, not initially, but I do. I think they are they. I think they understand from the discussions I had with them so far, they understand that it's probably a miss not to have it at one point like I for me, Aura and the streaming over time will probably converge more if you know this works, but it will be very difficult to Ara that are all like the whole cap table was built around health now, right? And so and, but is it possible for us to do like, you know, maybe even license some of the IP for like, doing like, a small part of what they do, but then, you know, have a significantly broader applicability in AI and be the expert there. And this is just lastly on like, because we talked about the mainstream adoption and positioning, and aura is such a big market leader now, because it's not just about the technical capability, but it's also about brand building, and that's the other thing that I really think this company is good at, from what I can see so far and the people they have brought on, and how they communicate, and how thoughtful they are in talking to both users and in the conversations I've had with them, but I think it is, it is as much about building an aspirational brand as it is about, you know, making the right design choices and being on the right form factor. And I think they bring that together.

S Speaker 213:56How do we think about brand building, kind of, you know, obviously, in this market and ecosystem, everything is moving so quickly. Yeah, and they think, you know that they are a very measured team and trying to build the right product, but they're not, per se, trying to write they're not trying to sell a million units next year. They're very pragmatic, right? They want a very high, engaged user base, a couple of core customers, and kind of building brand around that. How do you think of timescale in consumer hardware? Since I don't want to say software is less of a differentiating feature, and so is the hardware potentially. So which like, how do you compound that that brand growth in software or hardware?

14:44Yeah, it's, it's,
14:47or what would, what would define success, I guess, a year from now?
or what would, what would define success, I guess, a year from now?
or what would, what would define success, I guess, a year from now?
or what would, what would define success, I guess, a year from now?
S Speaker 114:50Yeah, no, no. And it's like, I'm hesitating a bit because it's something that I am like, it's not, I don't have the perfect answer to because, and I have invested, like, beyond the ones that we mentioned. I've invested in multiple companies that I have, like, have like done went to North of 100 million in a few years. So I think I know that it's possible, and I've seen the playbook, but it was not always the right decision to do it so quickly. And so what I'm thinking is that I actually think that there, I do align with their approach of making sure we have the best product in the market, and we keep the users trust before we go for crazy scale. And so I think we're still in the next and they are measured, but they also made a lot of progress in a few years, and took over a long time to get to a first product that was that was that had product market fit, and at the time, also, it's easy to forget, like people until they raise at 11, billion people were not paying attention, you know, like, and it was not mainstream. And I knew that it was gonna I had a high suspicion it's gotta be mainstream, because I invested in in calm, the meditation. I better series A there. And so, like, I learned about the sleep issues through that, and then, or was a natural like, next step to that. And so I thought that it was going to cross into mainstream, but it was very much dismissed by by by Silicon Valley for a long time. And so it coming from Finland, making a lot of sense. And even aura from sorry, sent by the streaming from from New York, I think makes sense, but combines a bit more like this, like understanding, with like then also, and hopefully the commercial capability. So I think, just to make it short, I do think it's good to take our time with the first product because I think that making sure that the product experience of the first course of users is spectacular will set the foundation for actually scaling significantly faster the following years, once we have that product market fit. But I think a lot about this is like, what are the features that you do? What are the features that you don't do? What is the next product that you add to this? Is it the audio thing? Is it the video thing? Like, how do you think about those things, but then make the right decisions? It's more important, I think, for the brand building, than going to a bigger scale faster, my approach at least. And a lot of things change all the time, right? Like, to your point with you. Maine, like, if we launched mid or end of next year, we might have significantly better technology and feature than somebody that rushes to market now in q1 and so, like, I think we if we believe that technology evolves from we're looking at our smartphone and computers to voice interactions with AI, which I think can replace a lot of the workflows and communication of what we use the device for today, then it deserves the time to do it right. You know, that's also why I think it's good that we raise a bit more and like be thoughtful about it, because we really want to not rush and be wrong, but be thoughtful and then build on the success and the advantages that are just like, you know, changing every month at the moment.
Yeah, no, no. And it's like, I'm hesitating a bit because it's something that I am like, it's not, I don't have the perfect answer to because, and I have invested, like, beyond the ones that we mentioned.

S Speaker 317:51And Nico, how do you compare? We've had both experiences with consumer hardware founders, which is founders who were, who happened, who had a good sense of the spend, and then founders who didn't have a good sense of the spend, it made a big difference, compared to since you've done bunch of these, or also compared to the founders at aura, for example. How do you compare sandbar? Because sometimes, as you know, like in consumer hardware, one also, it's not as easy to raise capital in early days before you actually prove yes exactly you can't go out and raise. So how do you what's your sense there?

S Speaker 118:42I think that it's always very difficult. Like, I want to, won't lie, like, hard. I mean, you know this better than anyone. But like, hardware is hard, especially if you're new, you found us, it's hard. I think they have a big advantage, because they worked for, they worked in hardware for meta, right? So they have, like, they have done it in a company, and maybe they have, you know, like, not done it always right in terms of capital expenditure, but at least they understand, like, what it takes, and they have learned, and they now have a board that also, I think, is significantly more equipped to steer them well before, like, you're not talking about me, or you just, like, already, the way that it's built up, I think they're positioned in A way that there's a lot of experiences on hardware and guidance on it.

S Speaker 319:24Where did the founders from aura
Where did the founders from aura
Where did the founders from aura
Where did the founders from aura
S Speaker 119:26come from the so my relationship with the aura was actually so they had it was very difficult for them as well. It's like, it's Finnish people experience. It's engineered techie people. But the CEO that led them through this, into the commercial like that really made it mainstream. Is a guy called Harpreet who was my relationship with the company, who has since left the company, and there's now another CEO, but the he was originally an investor in the company, and he then took over as CEO, and it was still a one purchase hardware product at the time, and then we collaborated. I think I had the plan anyways, but our relationship strengthened, where I also proposed to him that they should do hardware Plus subscription, which drives a lot of lifetime value. And so we that was the transition that we let the company through, and that was really what broke it into the mainstream as well. Not just that. It is not just that. It is not just a business model. It's also that the functionality improved and the understanding of the mainstream that sleep is important improved. But like that was very important. So it was like actually very much a story of great technological achievement, but very the first software was not good. Week on the software side, week on the business side. In fact, had to bring in one of the early investors to lead the company to then break it through. So, like, it's one of the stories of, like, a lot of things actually went wrong, but it still was, you know, pulled by the market into existence, to this to this scale.

S Speaker 320:58Yeah, yeah, no, the reason why is the spend one, one thing that I was just over the years with consumer electronics, hardware founders, the ones that have come from big tech they Yeah, like a lot of Apple X Apple founders that with over years, you would think that, hey, there's all this. So what happened? You know, the big question I've always had for the last decade is like, okay, Apple this amazing consumer hardware app, a lot of that talent should have created the next generation of consumer hardware companies, right?
Yeah, yeah, no, the reason why is the spend one, one thing that I was just over the years with consumer electronics, hardware founders, the ones that have come from big tech they Yeah, like a lot of Apple X Apple founders that with over years, you would think that, hey, there's all this.

21:37What happened there?
S Speaker 121:40Yeah, I don't know it's but I have, you can always find one like ponder example, right? But I have a company in the portfolio that's in San Francisco, which is two engineers that work on Apple intelligence. And I think people are just starting to leave. It was such a like, it's been so dominant over the last like, few decades that they were able to keep people, and, I don't know, maybe didn't really learn. Maybe it was so siloed that they didn't learn how to do the whole thing. But this company is then robotics, and with like, three, 4 million in seed funding, they were able to get to a very good functional prototype that's in actually, it's very unique, I realized. But like, it happens. It can happen.
Yeah, I don't know it's but I have, you can always find one like ponder example, right?

S Speaker 322:22Those guys in general, yeah, General, I've seen, like a lot of this consumer hardware, the new consumer hardware form factor. They come from, non big tech. Yeah, the spend is one question that we're going to spend a little more time on as well.

S Speaker 322:40How did they plan to use the funding? What are their thought process? I mean, I was pretty close to humane as well. I saw very close

S Speaker 322:56And both those companies rates lots of cap and then the timing and capital spent. So you have to be mindful that the timing is not there for a lot. So you don't have to rush it. Yeah, have to rush it, because now you're running out of capital. Yes, prove something. You rush the product. And then products,
And both those companies rates lots of cap and then the timing and capital spent. So you have to be mindful that the timing is not there for a lot. So you don't have to rush it. Yeah, have to rush it, because now you're running out of capital. Yes, prove something. You rush the product. And then products,

Yeah, have to rush it, because now you're running out of capital. Yes, prove something. You rush the product. And then products,
S Speaker 323:22that plays the decision timing is primarily related to, okay, I'm running out of capital or something, yeah, and the investors,

that plays the decision timing is primarily related to, okay, I'm running out of capital or something, yeah, and the investors,
that plays the decision timing is primarily related to, okay, I'm running out of capital or something, yeah, and the investors,
S Speaker 123:33yeah, I ended like, I look, I think I appreciate if you spend more time on it with them. And I will do the same, because I do, like, just so you understand, like, I'm not a Silicon Valley, like, let's just burn and, like, go out. Like, I'm very, very, like, very, I'm German, like I am, but I'm also, like, capital is, like, I'm an early stage investor. I don't want to dilute as much. I've, like, been burned and like, I do think it's important to take time, but it's like, whatever they raise now will have to be enough to launch and have impact so that we can actually raise around that, you know, is healthy, and it's also why I don't, you know, I think there's a limit to the valuation things like that at this point in time, because we need to have flexibility. And then they agree with that, right? I think, like, I'm been very direct with them on this. And so like, you at least rest assured that like, I will be like, on the top of them to make sure that we are capital effective, you know. So it's not about like, I would also like, even like, it happens a lot. Like, obviously, for hardware, you need more money, so you have to consider, but like, I would not like, if we have the chance to raise, you know, 30 million at three times the valuation in three months, I would probably advise them not to do it, just because it sets expectations that we we are not in a position to do that. I think where we are now is already, like, really the borderline of what makes sense, right? And so like, I like, at least know that you have an Elio from that perspective. Because I certainly, I oftentimes finance companies in a way that I say this should be the last money that you need. And then if you need to raise more to do more, you obviously can do it, but you don't do it out of a position of weakness, right? Which is why I'm here again, interested in making the round a bit bigger, because I think you don't want to be in that corner very soon.
yeah, I ended like, I look, I think I appreciate if you spend more time on it with them. And I will do the same, because I do, like, just so you understand, like, I'm not a Silicon Valley, like, let's just burn and, like, go out.

okay, but it's good to
okay, but it's good to
okay, but it's good to
S Speaker 226:02meet you, obviously. We're gonna have a lot more questions and work to do over time, just trying to take your brain and see how you think of it. Obviously, you know, we've had experiences in early stage, both, you know, consumer about consumer hardware, you know, one of the so guys like Magic Leap in humane potentially too early to market, right there. It was a market of one they had to develop. It very difficult to do, maybe, you know, mistiming, but also others like, you know, as we start entering this space, there seems to be a lot of people like, there's a lot of dictation type tools. So there'll be a lot of noise in the market. And the question for us always, especially around hardware, is cost of acquisition costs, because educating the customer is crazy expensive, right? And finding that right base, I think they have something super interesting with their very narrow focus around note taking, but I'm not sure if customers, consumers, really understand the difference between that and a, you know, a pendant, or, you know, card from plot, or limitless, or, you know, whoever else is out there. So, you know, it's similar. You know, we're kind of around the dollars. How do you, how do you grow this? I'm not sure that's going to be an easy answer.

S Speaker 127:19No. It's like one of the key but it is also a good thing to ask, right because, and that's why, like, the DNA of the team of like, how they like, and there's something, and it's like, it's not a great well, let's say, let me start differently. It's like, I do think that acquisition process is very important, but i i combat this from a consumer software actually. So my arc and investments where I said I started a JSON consumer is, like, I started in actually, like, mostly, like, SMB focused, SaaS products. And then, you know, the fund that I started with, the first money, and Zendesk and loom and Typeform and, like, a bunch of, like, sexy, like, started software products. And then I went from there to mobile subscription. So there's companies, consumer companies, that are subscriptions. Look at some that into the hardware Plus
