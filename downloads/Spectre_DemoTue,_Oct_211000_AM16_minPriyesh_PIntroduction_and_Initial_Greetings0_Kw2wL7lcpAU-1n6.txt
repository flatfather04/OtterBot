S Speaker 20:58No worries, no worries. What brings it to us? How do you find out about specter Marco?

S Speaker 11:04I'm not exactly sure, right? And I was thinking about it. How did I get to know about specter the first time? But have signed up for your newsletter, and I've been looking at a last, last couple of editions, and some of the insights that you uncovered through that seemed really interesting. There were a few companies that I know personally, I don't I didn't think that a lot of VCs know about them, but, but then they were in the newsletter, some of the traction metrics that you also mentioned seemed quite interesting, so I just wanted to have a chat. I probably got it through one of the LinkedIn posts about someone somewhere, and I just signed up the newsletter, and that's how

S Speaker 11:46So I'll give you a little bit brief about the fund. So Qualcomm Ventures is the corporate venture arm of Qualcomm, and it sits within the Qualcomm corporation. So we invest only out of the balance sheet, and typically it's a global fund. We are deployed across six different regions in the entire group in us, we

Yes, go ahead. Much do you typically invest on a yearly basis? Yes,
S Speaker 12:10in us, just on us geography, we aim to deploy about 100 $50 million a year. So that's roughly about 15 new investments and some follow ons. And then check sizes would be anywhere from two to $15 million so we are very stage agnostic. Sometimes we do seed and smaller rounds there, and that's where the smaller check sizes come in. Sometimes we have also done pre IPO rounds, and sweet spot would still be series A with a check size of, say, five to $7 million
in us, just on us geography, we aim to deploy about 100 $50 million a year. So that's roughly about 15 new investments and some follow ons.

S Speaker 22:40and you said, like, I guess, like, agnostic, but like, I believe, for Qualcomm, topic of deep tech, AI is probably, like, top of mind, right? Yes,

S Speaker 12:49deep tech is analytics, yeah, 100 100% Marco, very big focus area for us. We are investing very aggressively in AI. So we have our own AI chips going into mobiles, PCs. There's a cloud inferencing platform. So invest quite heavily into AI robotics. Robotics is also somewhere we feel we have a lot of strategic angle, automobile tech stack, enterprise SaaS. Now there's no SaaS, there's everything is AI. So enterprise AI sometimes around, say, data center technologies. So think things around that

S Speaker 13:34yeah, so on sourcing, we have CrunchBase and pitch book that's mostly the databases we use. We are planning to try harmonic. We haven't gotten to that yet. And then alpha sends sometimes for market intelligence and internal CRM would be affinity,

5:10all of the feedback you
all of the feedback you
all of the feedback you
all of the feedback you
S Speaker 25:11have, like, on all these different databases that you mentioned are on specter anyway, just transparently, PitchBook remains kings when it comes to transaction data and cap table data. So if you guys can afford it, and, like, have a subscription, I would keep it. So for me, if I were you, it's really all about, what is net new, what can really, like, change the way that we source and invest because the reality situation is that you're not really going to be sourcing on PitchBook. I mean, you can, but it's always going to be or, like, harmonic or crunch with worldwide matters, right? Doesn't really matter. It's just always going to be based on some past event or lag indicator. Yes, whereas for us as back, they're like, powering up like the sequoias, the high speed Andreessen, the Founders Fund, excels the index. They don't care about those databases. By the time the piece of information is that is too late, so they use those for lookup, yeah, hey, I met this founder, or I met this company at an event. I just want to see some basic information. That's, that's, that's cool, yeah, but like, what about the next, you know, the next insight, the hidden insight. So, for example, we have, like this, I mean, obviously I can show you around, like, the platform is very advanced, so you have funding as acquisition IPOs, like, very basic stuff you get on PitchBook, you have the investor database where I can show you everything about a fund. Like, again, not super interesting, what's proprietary and what's like, very, very cool is the interest signals. So for example, here, I can say, Okay, show me this week, because this, this follows the market. So show me this week, all of the companies which are, let's say, pre launch, Bootstrap and Priyesh, which are early stage, which are based in United States, which are in pure deep tech AI, which we already know are killing it, are fast growing, and now we believe are in the market for capital. So for example, we're telling you, hey, there are multiple partners are notable, which are currently connecting with unit AI video, company building GTV. And we're telling you, hey, the company is absolutely killing it. We believe they are fundraising and something is going on. So if you want to know before it lands on PitchBook or harmonic. or whatever, then, yeah, like you probably should take an action right? Or Andreessen Horovitz and Pervis here talking to worldstone, Lightspeed villages and 12 notable capital point nine and many others looking to monogram user interface for the AGI. These are all companies that we already know of. But we're telling you, hey, we believe something is happening. Yeah, we believe the company is super cool, or they're growing super fast. We believe they are in the market for capital. And now we're giving you a proxy signal, an intense signal, which we call a positioning signal, ahead of the transaction. And we do that by tracking the investment team members and who they connect with on LinkedIn, who they follow on Twitter, which get a repository, interact with, and so forth. So this would be the first product. Then you have like the People section. Here. We have like, the largest people database on the market, and we also own it end to end. So like, it's the most updated. You can also layer on like your like your network that you can track via the Chrome extension. So every single person that you know, the individual team level. But then on top of it, we built another proprietary strategy that doesn't exist anywhere else, which basically track all of these people online across every single social media, Open Network and database, and we're able to put in front of a new company six months before it lands on pitch book, harmonic, crunchbad and so forth, because we do it based on what is net new to the market, not what is net new to my people database, who is getting updated by someone else, a third party, scraping, linking in some shady ways, right? So this is, as of now, the most powerful early stage sourcing strategies for anywhere, pre seed, seed, but also, arguably also cdsas, and then you have the company database, which is a bit of a company database on steroids. So I can take, like, a huge company, for example. Let's see one of the for example here, rippling and basically we tell you everything about it. Who do they sell to? Who are the customers? What are the traction highlights? What are the industry? Who are the founders? What are their emails, and what are the highlights? I can also zoom in on their profile specific and their entire experience. What are the funding data? What are the revenue signals with like aI summaries based on the source and what's going on, and also the interesting though, the company team, employee count, the full breakdown, the notable talent movement, the connections, the web data, the app data, the social media data, the reviews data due to crowd, trust, pilot cluster, news, similar companies. It's a bunch, it's a lot of data. So this one you would use to be the first one in the market to know about breakout companies and breakout opportunities. Show me companies any other states which are currently pure B to B, legal tech, which are currently, let's say, early stage and growth stage, where that haven't raised recently, and their team has experienced growth momentum in terms of head come in the past six Months. And the founders went through prior exit, prior IPO and a serial founder, so I can do this, and their website is pulling at least top 10, 10,000 web active visitors, and they also got at least 100 reviews on YouTube crowd. So I'm just freestyling here, but like, you can basically, like, put together, like queries using data that you normally you would need to license from, like, at least 30 different providers. And then I can push this into affinity in a click. And then lastly, something about pushing shortly is our revenue signals product we pull in real time, every single revenue mentioned across the entire market, every single social media post, every single news podcast, press release, company, website and so forth. So for example, here I'm telling you hey, there is this company, Pacer, in which is now like just hit 4 million in revenue
have, like, on all these different databases that you mentioned are on specter anyway, just transparently, PitchBook remains kings when it comes to transaction data and cap table data. So if you guys can afford it, and, like, have a subscription, I would keep it.

So show me this week, all of the companies which are, let's say, pre launch, Bootstrap and Priyesh, which are early stage, which are based in United States, which are in pure deep tech AI, which we already know are killing it, are fast growing, and now we believe are in the market for capital. So for example, we're telling you, hey, there are multiple partners are notable, which are currently connecting with unit AI video, company building GTV. And we're telling you, hey, the company is absolutely killing it. We believe they are fundraising and something is going on. So if you want to know before it lands on PitchBook or harmonic. or whatever, then, yeah, like you probably should take an action right? Or Andreessen Horovitz and Pervis here talking to worldstone, Lightspeed villages and 12 notable capital point nine and many others looking to monogram user interface for the AGI. These are all companies that we already know of. But we're telling you, hey, we believe something is happening. Yeah, we believe the company is super cool, or they're growing super fast. We believe they are in the market for capital. And now we're giving you a proxy signal, an intense signal, which we call a positioning signal, ahead of the transaction. And we do that by tracking the investment team members and who they connect with on LinkedIn, who they follow on Twitter, which get a repository, interact with, and so forth. So this would be the first product. Then you have like the People section. Here. We have like, the largest people database on the market, and we also own it end to end. So like, it's the most updated. You can also layer on like your like your network that you can track via the Chrome extension. So every single person that you know, the individual team level. But then on top of it, we built another proprietary strategy that doesn't exist anywhere else, which basically track all of these people online across every single social media, Open Network and database, and we're able to put in front of a new company six months before it lands on pitch book, harmonic, crunchbad and so forth, because we do it based on what is net new to the market, not what is net new to my people database, who is getting updated by someone else, a third party, scraping, linking in some shady ways, right? So this is, as of now, the most powerful early stage sourcing strategies for anywhere, pre seed, seed, but also, arguably also cdsas, and then you have the company database, which is a bit of a company database on steroids. So I can take, like, a huge company, for example. Let's see one of the for example here, rippling and basically we tell you everything about it. Who do they sell to? Who are the customers? What are the traction highlights? What are the industry? Who are the founders? What are their emails, and what are the highlights? I can also zoom in on their profile specific and their entire experience. What are the funding data? What are the revenue signals with like aI summaries based on the source and what's going on, and also the interesting though, the company team, employee count, the full breakdown, the notable talent movement, the connections, the web data, the app data, the social media data, the reviews data due to crowd, trust, pilot cluster, news, similar companies. It's a bunch, it's a lot of data. So this one you would use to be the first one in the market to know about breakout companies and breakout opportunities. Show me companies any other states which are currently pure B to B, legal tech, which are currently, let's say, early stage and growth stage, where that haven't raised recently, and their team has experienced growth momentum in terms of head come in the past six Months. And the founders went through prior exit, prior IPO and a serial founder, so I can do this, and their website is pulling at least top 10, 10,000 web active visitors, and they also got at least 100 reviews on YouTube crowd. So I'm just freestyling here, but like, you can basically, like, put together, like queries using data that you normally you would need to license from, like, at least 30 different providers. And then I can push this into affinity in a click. And then lastly, something about pushing shortly is our revenue signals product we pull in real time, every single revenue mentioned across the entire market, every single social media post, every single news podcast, press release, company, website and so forth. So for example, here I'm telling you hey, there is this company, Pacer, in which is now like just hit 4 million in revenue
S Speaker 111:21for for one of these input signals, Marco, can I go and see the source of that data

S Speaker 111:53Yeah, totally. That mark was super interesting. Love some of the features you've built I have, both from an investment perspective and also from a perspective of sort, just seeing if we can adopt a few solutions. Seen a lot of AI native companies trying to build something like this. I don't see any of them have this level of depth in terms of just uncovering some of the signals. So that's that's super interesting, for sure. How do you price it? Marco, it's quite straightforward.

I think the website is, like, a great representation where we are, where we're at, and we were headed next. We just recently launched it. Actually, like, updated it. So if you I can follow up with a summary of my own to take from, like, pitch book, harmonic, etc, you feel free to forward it internally.

S Speaker 214:16and in that case, I think it's even more powerful, like certain type of products, because the problem is that everybody will get access to what you have access right now, which is pitch, book, data, post transactions. So the company already exists. So the challenge is that you have no unless you keep in touch with every single one of them every single day. There's no way you can keep up with like the fastest growing ones and all of the signals that they experience on a daily basis, right? So that's, that's, that's the main use case.
