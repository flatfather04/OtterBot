13:11in a seed round,
S Speaker 213:13right? We are good with money for now, like we're not going to come up for obviously, for some time we have enough. So I think we are. We are in a good spot. But I think all the relationships like in real life, it takes time to build it so much, venture folks, corporate ventures, as well as the other later series companies, just make sure that we have that relationship first when the time is right, right? So Ross, I can, I can give you a brief overview of folk from ventures. So you, of course, are familiar with fault form, right? Have you interacted with the venture side before? No, I have not interacted with Qualcomm venture. I mean, I'm familiar with the rest of the corporate adventure, but no, I've not had any traction with the welcome venture. So let me, let me give you a quick overview, and then talk about why we are looking at this base and what we find interesting and and, of course, I appreciate your background that you know you've just closed funding. Firstly, congratulations on that it's, I suppose, be funding, and you probably have good runway and won't look for funding anytime soon. But I believe in building that relationship, so I'm very aligned with how you're thinking so. So let me start with the venture side, right? So it is, interestingly, our 25th year. This year, our venture team has, yeah, the venture setup has been around for 25 plus years, and we are a stage agnostic financial VC with corporate ties, right? So we are answerable to our LP, because it's fully funded by balance sheet capital. What that means is we can make investments, but we have to be in a we have to have some strategic tie. It doesn't have to be a formal contract. It can be loosely defined as a, you know, a potential product partnership or a potential customer or an ecosystem player, right? So that is how we tend to operate. In terms of ticket size, we rise any right anywhere from one to $15 million with an average being seven to eight. And we like operating at the series A and B, right? So this is hoping that at Series A, we we intercept and, you know, see how, how the Fit works out at that point. So that's a quick overview of the venture side. You know, we're a global team. We have multiple in focus areas. I can now talk about, you know, why we are looking at this space. But any questions on the venture side before I talk about,

S Speaker 220:06four to 5000 incident a month, and investigations which typically, and I'll give you sort of two example, and I'll give you the differentiation, but one of the companies, automotive manufacturer, probably to your customer as well. But then the other company is in the entertainment industry. And, you know, entertainment industry, what the senior SRE told me once they were of course, lot of SRE, by definition, are very skeptical people. They will see it. They are not going to buy this white blue, but Whitey working. I think I get a little bit annoyed for white blue, because when freaking you to am you get paid, you do not hear right? I mean, it is, yeah. It sounds true. Yeah,

I mean, it is, yeah. It sounds true. Yeah,
S Speaker 221:11you know, I have all respect to my competitors, and I'm like, I've been in the business for a very long time, so I never disrespect, or I never say anything about it, but this is actually doing the disturbance to the whole industry by kind of, because SREs are skeptical. They are not going to fall for your time, right? And we need to be much more proud. So coming back to the what CNS three, the investigation, which are doing it, I've been looking at it, and I've been kind of, so they'll sort of used our system to do the investigation in parallel to their people. They started speaking investigation because they are also trying to prove out in terms of yes it is accurate or not. Is it finding the right thing or not right? So this thing was things which has taken me six, eight hours. You guys are delegated order of less than 10 minutes, somewhere in five to seven minutes range, right? And places where we do not, and this is what I've been very upfront with, are my customers saying, If I told you my AI system means every problem 100% of time, you will say yes, but the times when it doesn't get it and over accuracy is 90% plus, right? We see a very, very high we see that because, so I'm going to come there. But what this point is that this gives me a lot of good insight in terms of, what are the domains you already addressed, you've looked at it, and you're sort of eliminated it, right? So if I have to sort of do a part to work as if, like, do a horrible call, you know, I can immediately sort of nail it down and say, This is the group. Maybe it's the on prem data center group which needs to look at it from a network perspective. It has nothing to do with applications, nothing to do with Kubernetes. So let's not get them involved. Let's focus on what the domain which the AI team has analyzed, it and potential it comes up with the root cause in their cases. But things which has taken six minutes the other place where we're deployed. You know, it was very interesting. Again, things have taken this humanities expert, the guy managing Kubernetes for a very long time is like, I'm going to create a situation. I want to see your teammate going and figuring it out, right? So that's fine, right? So he's like, I know there's a problem with this cluster. We trigger a proactive investigation, which is also an important aspect of it, right? Because their studies are not only on the horrible calls, but they're also doing a lot of proactive actions, so we absolutely do support that. So we, of course, investigated the accumulated issue. We found what he was, he had seen it, but we found another two issues, and he dropped up in two minutes and saying, check, I need to go fix this, because I didn't know about this, right? So inability to find out some of the latency, which are just sitting there and people have not noticed it. It's just because humans are not very good at keeping billions of dogs in their head right about the accuracy of the writing IPO our system and on both those customers, we have got head on against the usual four, which we talked about it in the SI space, and we have won right a lot of people. We have seen a huge difference between what other competitors are offering versus being offered. And I think our key differentiation is that aspect of cross domain correlation, like which is a thesis I've been driving it now for four years. Even at Cisco, I was writing this platform called Full Stack Absolutely. And the reason it was important is, if you look at today's state of art for absolutely vendors, is build a dashboard, any new integration dashboard, right? So your dashboard for network, your dashboard for some dashboard for messaging, your dashboard for humanity, your dashboard for some application transactions, your dashboard your front end monitoring, right? What ends up happening is right. I call this makeup, because your sies are sort of manually going to each of those dashboards, trying to parse what's going on and trying to figure it out right under probably right. And so it clearly puts a network. So our thesis, when I was running auxiliary at Cisco, and I was also involved in the instance because actualization of Splunk, my thesis was saying, Look, you have to bring this data across different domains, whether it's network security, humanities, applications and so and so forth, because today, that work is done by your operations team. If your goal is to reduce a TTR, if you do not analyze this cross domain impact, because your application depends upon all of those domains, you're always going to be shocked. So two of ways to solve in my mind at that time, one was bring all the data together and then do anomaly detection, do baselining, figure it out what's going on. Create a dynamic dependency graph, because typically problem will be seen on front end, but it may be database problem or it may be something in possessive problem, right? So bring that in. The two challenges with that which I saw it right? One was, it gets super expensive when you start to get data from all of these places ingest costs are not your friends, like Splunk is notoriously known for having very expensive solution, and so is the data, right? So people don't like to duplicate data in one platform, just because you want to see this better, right? The second thing is, every organization, enterprise. I go, there are 1015, tools. Every tool has their buyer persona and people who are big fan boys of those, right? So when we go and say all those 15 tools, here is the one rule to one tool to rule them all, and it will solve all your problem. You know what the response is?
you know, I have all respect to my competitors, and I'm like, I've been in the business for a very long time, so I never disrespect, or I never say anything about it, but this is actually doing the disturbance to the whole industry by kind of, because SREs are skeptical. They are not going to fall for your time, right? And we need to be much more proud. So coming back to the what CNS three, the investigation, which are doing it, I've been looking at it, and I've been kind of, so they'll sort of used our system to do the investigation in parallel to their people. They started speaking investigation because they are also trying to prove out in terms of yes it is accurate or not. Is it finding the right thing or not right? So this thing was things which has taken me six, eight hours. You guys are delegated order of less than 10 minutes, somewhere in five to seven minutes range, right? And places where we do not, and this is what I've been very upfront with, are my customers saying, If I told you my AI system means every problem 100% of time, you will say yes, but the times when it doesn't get it and over accuracy is 90% plus, right? We see a very, very high we see that because, so I'm going to come there. But what this point is that this gives me a lot of good insight in terms of, what are the domains you already addressed, you've looked at it, and you're sort of eliminated it, right?
