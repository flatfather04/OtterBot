S Speaker 10:04that is also essentially, they focus on, you know, lip movement, they focus on face and they really just focus on brand avatars. And then there, what type of markets are they going after, right? Like they're going after they're going after big brands like enterprises to create brand avatars, right? That's what they're going they're not going after ads, per se. They're going after training, creating internal training videos, employee training videos. They're going after all of those types of use cases, right? So that's simply okay. So now you get a good understanding of what that space is, and then what is like, there's Synthesia, there's Tabas that is going after the same thing I can't see now, similarly, as you can understand, when I draw the same thing for captions or cool are there Other companies in that category, like this one category is brand avatars for training and enterprise brand avatars, or those types of use cases, right? And then the tech stack over there is

S Speaker 11:21and the traction for those companies are the two companies over there that we know it's Synthesia Tavis traction. Here's what it is, here's the investors and here's the valuations. Right? See what I'm saying? Yeah, right now it's all clubbed together into this one table, and I can't really tell who's doing what. Like from this I cannot really tell other platforms like it's all clubbed together into one. I can't tell who's doing what.

S Speaker 11:55so the idea that I want to get from this one slide is is, what's the other category? Where? Where does who a cool play? Where does he play? Where does icon play? Where does creative fight play? Where does creative play? Yeah, right. And then one can tell the clear difference in terms of product and go to market product stack and go to market stack from one view, what, how is creating? What is creatives wedge in this market? Right? So the key messages are over there up top. The key message, there will be two key messages. One, there are many different pockets of spaces within generative media and generative advertising, and the tech stacks for each one of them are slightly different. And then the second one is that the traction for each one of these

S Speaker 13:01a good traction, which is, they've grown fast over the last few years. And then the question that we need to answer after this, which is we don't need to answer for today, is that, why are these growing fast? Which is, My hunch is That's because you lowered the barrier to entry for people to create. So that's why that's resulting in more prosumer and less enterprise, because prosumers are fast to adopt this all of a sudden, and that's why you're seeing a lot of prosumer traction. That's my hunch, but I think that's something that we need to further diligence and figure out that's the picture that I want from this one slide, so that like one slide that tells you the
a good traction, which is, they've grown fast over the last few years.

S Speaker 23:53right? So for this slide, now, let's so you'd suggest we remove all of the videos, keep that as another slide, in case we have to show some broad output comparisons and then have the table for the entire slide add like,

S Speaker 14:09if you have videos, then the video should show like Synthesia. Video should show what Synthesia is doing, right and similar to tab as, I believe, have as a similar space,

and they're also growing well, right?
and they're also growing well, right?
and they're also growing well, right?
S Speaker 14:26But then you need to have another video. What specifically call out, right? Like, this is the category over there is enterprise brand ambassadors or or training videos, right? Like, like, that's what they're going after. And then you need to categorize for that category. Here's the two companies right right now, I cannot tell who's doing what like, what is Haitian doing? What is Synthesia doing? Like, I can't tell what is who is doing what is like, yeah. So that's the version. So that that right now, I can't I like that if I'm, if I'm Quinn looking at it for the first time, all of a sudden, I cannot picture where, where is creative? What does creativity do? Yeah,
But then you need to have another video. What specifically call out, right? Like, this is the category over there is enterprise brand ambassadors or or training videos, right?

S Speaker 15:25okay, too much words. We don't need this. It is back up this trend then, because the truth is, the trend should be covered in like that first slide that I talked about. I
