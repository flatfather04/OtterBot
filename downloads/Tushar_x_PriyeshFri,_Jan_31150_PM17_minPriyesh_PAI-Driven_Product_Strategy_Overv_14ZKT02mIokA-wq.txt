S Speaker 10:08all of these that have grown from zero to close to 100 million. Arr, less than 12 months. Yes, they have product led motion, plg, but then all really, really smart founders that have a very product centric approach that are using AI, I mean, it's not like so all of these products. So one difference between your legacy products and then the new products is the legacy products, if you think about it, their legacy products. The way they are incorporating AI is they have a want button that does, like, okay, pilot button or whatever, right? Yeah, versus so. So they're using legacy products to disrupt with a, you know, add AI as a feature, versus thinking from a AI with the ground up like cursor is thinking with a new UX altogether, it was a tab UX or cursor, which is tab completions, but tab completions of full code, not like just nine code, yeah, full code, and then automatically figure out where is the next tab completion going to be in your coding, and entire coding, and that was something that disrupted completely. So you didn't need like, whatever like, you had to think from a ground up for AI. So the other one, like, so all of these, they at the same time, they all combined product led growth with virality. They knew how to go viral on x. They knew how to go they all went viral on Tiktok. They all went viral on x. They all went viral on

S Speaker 11:54persona for most of these have been people in their 20s and 30s. Yeah. Cursor. Cursor, if you asked, if you ask a coder that is an experienced coder, and you know who has been coding for the last 20 years, most of those guys haven't tried cursor, I don't know if you saw the stats the entire YC badge for this year they asked in the first day, they asked the first day out of, I think 300 people, how many of you use cursor every day? 220
persona for most of these have been people in their 20s and 30s. Yeah. Cursor.

S Speaker 22:29said, yeah, yeah. Demo Day, yeah. The day before. And like, the entire room was all developers, all young developers, everyone used cursor, everyone used codium. All of them are all about it, yeah, so,
said, yeah, yeah. Demo Day, yeah. The day before. And like, the entire room was all developers, all young developers, everyone used cursor, everyone used codium. All of them are all about it, yeah, so,

S Speaker 12:44so. So your target persona for all of these have been these 2030, year olds, right? So people in there, like even late teams and and these guys, they're consuming, I mean, so, so when you talk about virality, what I see like age and all these guys they targeted, you know, in when they initially launched, they did a perfect launch for on X, perfect launch on YouTube. Perfect launcher, you know, tick tock like perplexity and super active on all of these platforms.

3:22at least that's what like I've seen in terms
at least that's what like I've seen in terms
at least that's what like I've seen in terms
at least that's what like I've seen in terms
3:29of virality, all these guys.

3:32So, and then what I want
So, and then what I want
So, and then what I want
So, and then what I want
S Speaker 13:34to do is, so, so one of the things that I so, I think I want to do one, I'll do one slide, which is what's the like, as I have looked at all of these companies, right? All grew really fast, and there are certain two, three trends that I think
to do is, so, so one of the things that I so, I think I want to do one, I'll do one slide, which is what's the like, as I have looked at all of these companies, right? All grew really fast, and there are certain two, three trends that I think

3:51the third one is,
S Speaker 13:57yeah, I want us to get inserted with a few of these investments, because all of these guys, they, you know, they're coming from this Stanford, Berkeley farm, and we have to get connected into this, something that I want to talk to You about, figure out Stanford like, which are the Stanford outlets? And let's go figure out how to like, have events that we need to get plugged into the Stanford earlier stage, Stanford. Forget any other school. This is Stanford. Yeah, Stanford is the biggest farm that I've seen. Figure out what are Stanford like, early stage How did this guy find like, yesterday, you saw, right? So that this deal came to me through this other guy that I know they're like early stage fund, and he's always, he's training in for two and a half years. Yeah, right. So so I think, like, where is the Stanford Demo Day? Like, Let's get plugged in to this Stanford ecosystem. Okay, and let's cover budgets, if, like, you have to spend, you know, a few $100,000 in event. What? What have you at these places. Let's do that. I'm all open to trying that out, like we can, like, not like we can cover like, $50,000 budget to do things here. Okay,
yeah, I want us to get inserted with a few of these investments, because all of these guys, they, you know, they're coming from this Stanford, Berkeley farm, and we have to get connected into this, something that I want to talk to You about, figure out Stanford like, which are the Stanford outlets?

S Speaker 27:58understood. Sure got it and get started on that few companies I wanted to discuss with you. And before I do that, Tushar, I had a chat with Sergio. So that got me a lot of good info on how I can follow up with some companies we met last year, which weren't sort of at our stage then, but how can we reconnect to them. So I'll start doing that. Should I suggest a few companies for our off site, or whatever we are having startup showcase? You can?
