S Speaker 10:00This platform, which is super interesting, because a lot of these other companies, like Titan, they are billion dollar plus, but they are not agent native today. Does that really need to be the case? We need to understand that, right? So that's why I was thinking maybe on the next call, right? We do two things, we unpack the pipeline in the traction and focus on the technical differentiation that they have, right? And during that, we'll try to understand why, why are customers buying it? Because I think kindo also didn't figure it out until recently that they have to go after DevOps and SecOps in this case. So if you look at their branding from way before it was a generalist agent platform, yeah, they were not building it for DevOps. So it is an evolution. Having said that, I think there are multiple players in this space, as we talked about SRE and, you know, automation, SecOps, automation, we should talk to at least a few more before we make a conclusion either way, right? So what on the side I was hoping to do was I remember we had identified a few names, and we had reached out to a few any any follow up from any of them.

S Speaker 11:41we can try to learn more from there. But any founder calls from any of the companies, no, no, haven't had got it any any email that you'd send it to them, or it's only been LinkedIn. It's been LinkedIn so far. I will send a set of evenings today. Yeah, it's been email. No, it's been LinkedIn, LinkedIn. So one thing I'll say on LinkedIn, because they'll either not look at LinkedIn at all, or if they looked at it for different reasons, they look at the common connections, or they look at your profile, and they might not think of nothing against you. But yes, so what I'll suggest is maybe, if it's been a week or more than a week, try to cold email. Yeah, we should write a cold email. So what? What else suggest is send me a template. Yeah, right. I'll update it, and I'll and we should just not waste time, but maybe have a burst of 10 emails go out at the same time to 10 companies. Okay, let's just reach out, you know, let's see who, who replies. What I will do is, on my end, I'll start finding common connections or any investors. Let's say, if somebody doesn't reply, how do we because that's the biggest next step right now, which is talking to more players. Yeah,
