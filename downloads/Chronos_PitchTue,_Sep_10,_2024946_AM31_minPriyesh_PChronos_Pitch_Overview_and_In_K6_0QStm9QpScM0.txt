S Speaker 17:31Okay, the way it works. Here we have three, three protocols. The first protocol is Wi Fi. The second is how I band, and the third one is Bluetooth.
Okay, the way it works. Here we have three, three protocols. The first protocol is Wi Fi. The second is how I band, and the third one is Bluetooth.
Okay, the way it works. Here we have three, three protocols. The first protocol is Wi Fi. The second is how I band, and the third one is Bluetooth.
Okay, the way it works. Here we have three, three protocols. The first protocol is Wi Fi. The second is how I band, and the third one is Bluetooth.
S Speaker 17:56The first one is so the first one Bluetooth. It allows you to get connected with a phone. So if you can visualize the Wi Fi, send the information between, in between the anchors. And also you have what you call x studio, which is a screen which is like with some edge processing on it, where they collect all the data. X collector. It is inside the studio, and you can or you can use your phone, or you can use a studio to see everybody moving up and down. And you have white band. It basically calculate the distance between the anchors, but also it calculate the distance with with the all the tags in the tags, you have also the tower band, Wi Fi and Bluetooth, but and, but also, it detects the cell phone signal, LTE, 5g, and any regular equipment. It's like your phone. You know when you put it on you still you see you push Wi Fi, and you see all the list of Wi Fi that is around you. The only difference is that you're going to be able to click on one and see who is where, and you can be able to see movie, right? Because that's the way that, the way it was, got it. It's a very, very, it's not a known science, because it's wave and it's ricochet. It's really sometimes very confusing, because it's sometimes a reflection. That's why, for example, GPS does not work in density. When you're close to big city, in big building, the signal ricochet on the on the structure, Understood, understood Marco so the edge processing. Is it happening on the anchors? Or do you have a special box for it? It's very good questions we have to do. We have, we have processing power here, and we send the input. They have the processing power. But we have unprocessing processor in there that sends information to to the x, to the collector, that sends also to the this regulation, the studio. And then you see all this slide. It's like 10 times per second refresh rate. So it's really movement, very cool. And, and, and then you can, then, if you are connected to a cloud, if you have an access point, you can send to the cloud for like, for more edge processing, Understood, understood. Got it so now that I have a better understanding Marco with the firefighters application, how would the user persona be like, would they what's the plan? Would they have tags on themselves, and they would go out at a site and set up these anchors somewhere so that they are able to locate the entire property better? How? How would this work? Very good question. There is two ways that they got to do it. They respect the anchors. They will stick them on whatever they can. Four of them, and it's immediate, but they go and they, each of them, were attacked, and you're going to have a captain behind with a spin to be able to see everywhere. And if they see somebody falling, because they have a total detection, they know exactly where it is, and they will tell the firefighter to check now, if a firefighter has also an anchor, because an anchor can be also attack, okay, and but it could be. But then, if they have another, what you call X, note when, when the anchor moves x node, when they have an x node. And if they have a screen here, they'd be able to see the people themselves, where they are, instead of receiving the information from the cabinet. That's number one, number two, and this is what they are. They really want is they want to put as soon as they arrive, before they arrive, they can put the information the address. We can import the information of the building, and the Automatically, the X video, calculate what is the best position for the four anchors on the drones to set themselves up around the building for best coverage. And as they stop, the drones go up, and they go into the building, and they will detect the batch on the tags on the people, got it, got it. So how are the anchors able to detect, let's say, people who are already in the building and who don't have Yes, yes, yes. Did you miss me? Is it better now the beginning

So how are the anchors able to detect, let's say, people who are already in the building and who don't have Yes, yes, yes. Did you miss me? Is it better now the beginning
S Speaker 112:44was saying that. How are the anchors able to detect people who are already in the building and who might not have tags on them?
was saying that. How are the anchors able to detect people who are already in the building and who might not have tags on them?
was saying that. How are the anchors able to detect people who are already in the building and who might not have tags on them?
was saying that. How are the anchors able to detect people who are already in the building and who might not have tags on them?
12:55Yes, I cell phone. If they have nothing on them, we can detect it. Okay, okay.
Yes, I cell phone. If they have nothing on them, we can detect it. Okay, okay.
Yes, I cell phone. If they have nothing on them, we can detect it. Okay, okay.
Yes, I cell phone. If they have nothing on them, we can detect it. Okay, okay.
S Speaker 112:59Now let me add something that I usually don't say we have another technology that we are working on. It's called UW radar that will detect people even if they have no electronics. So you put them on on the drones, and it will detect people even if they have nothing on them. And how does that work? Is it? Is it through computer vision? And how is that working? It's, it's not vision AI. It's basically being able to detect mass of people moving. Well, if they don't move, we can't find them, but if they move, you can have the movement like a radar. It has the same technology of the radar, and they will detect interesting data, interesting Marco and yes, please go ahead. Now. The really cool thing about I think, and this is something that will be very attractive to, I think, Qualcomm and other big corporation, is that when we gone, we got because our technology is only, it's not the hardware, the hardware, when we start building the hardware, phones did not have that. Now, all the phones, cars, they have with Hawaii dance, because that's an our IP is only predictive location algorithm. So in the future, everything is going to go it going to migrate into the cell phones. As soon as we're going to be able to access the cloud band in the phone, we're going to be able to put our technology into the phone. So with our app people, we can create private mesh network and locate every RF that every move, moving phone or every moving even if they have Bluetooth, yeah, they'd be able to localize, and that's where there's a huge, huge market besides, of course, the meter, right, right? Yeah, that, that would certainly be game changing, for sure. Right now. Marco from, from the perspective of a physical device, beyond first responders. What are the markets? Do you see using this? Okay, we have to, we have the military. We are just entering into a contract with the lady. And we are also going to enter in the control of the Air Force. The biggest problem right now in military is that in combat zone, GPS is shocked. So people, they don't know where the trucks are, they don't know where the soldiers are, and it's a nightmare. So there is a huge push from the unit from DOD to find new solution of that cannot be jammed. And because we are using ultra wideband, with cloudband active GPS is very low. Spectrum is up to one gigahertz, and but we are between, we have three to 9.5 gigahertz. So it's that's why they call it intra wideband, and it's pretty impossible to jam the entire spectrum. If you do do some of the spectrum, you need so much power, so we're going to be able to detect where you are, where the camera is. So they cannot do that, yeah, because that's why the Air Force and the the Navy is very interested. The detail too much because of under NDA. But yes, it's basically also mostly with, with the drones, when they lose GPS, so they will be able not to lose DPS anymore. It will be soldiers, this mountain soldiers, you know, they have, they all have the S 22 Samsung that they were here, and they have an app called ATAC. And with ATAC, they have the map, and they can they see, where is everybody, when the GPS, they see nothing. Yeah. So by integrating our technology in there, they're going to be able to restore and even be able to connect and see people inside business, where they are, right, because that should actually use market that can humongous market. The other market, we went to Neo, I don't know if you know, in Saudi there is this new city that was 171 kilometer long that they reduced it to 4.2 kilometer. Yeah, yeah. They were sent. They were spending three and a half in there. They do 4.2 kilometer. Now they're doing it. They're going to open by 2030 but still spending 400 billion in this. So this is smaller, but it's still going. So we went there. They were so amazed by the technology. They want to put it in, in the city courts, building city codes for neon, yeah, and then later to extend into the country. So what this will do when they send the drones with our technology, they will be able to detect to see crowd control heat maps, if there is a problem, where is the closest security guard to send him? So there is so many use cases for them. It's available. So right now, we have the three biggest market. We are already working. We are generating some revenue, very little 50 last year. This year will be probably 600,000 2 million. Next year is going to be probably three to 5 million. And then 2027 this is 2026 this is when we start going up right interesting Marco, and one question on the previous use case. Marco, let's say if you're detecting people based on their cell phone signals, how are you able to differentiate whether this is one person? This specific person is a security guard versus an normal citizen, versus x, y, z, okay. Is it a security guard, you know is a print so you know who it is. You have the you have information, so you know it's if it's somebody else you don't know, but if there is any, and this is what I'm hearing from the south, from the southeast, because here, I don't think you can do it in London or in the US, yeah. But if there is any fraction, you have the right to go to the telco and ask for this print the E, l, e, i, what? What would it belong to? And you have the phone number and the name of the person got it Understood, understood. So one, what's the plan? When? When do you plan to shift from more of a product based solution to integrating everything on the mobile app and becoming more of a software player? Okay? So we are right now. We are proving everything with the hardware or hardware. Yeah, as soon as we have permission from we have access the API access from Android and iOS. This is when we start migrating everything. So I think already Android is releasing APIs, so we are looking into it. So my guess knowing how slow things are, but by the end of next year, this is when this is going to happen. In the meantime, the military, they don't want any integration. They want to have something. They want to own, because our business model is it's just a service. So we have two kind of customers that customers of customers would be like Karski Maya more in Singapore, for example, they have 12,000 square meter. We quoted them 15,000 US per month for the per month, and it's the money is coming from security, from cleaning, because I want to make sure people are saying enough time in each room, because so they can see that. And it's also for delivery, which is extremely important. You know, for example, grab. It's like Uber Eats the grant needs in Singapore, you don't deliver within 20 minutes. They don't the customer does not pay, yeah, so they need to know exactly they have a problem with the last and you know, when you are the most it meter is a big problem, right? And the big one, like for Saudi, we got this inquiry for 5 million people immigration. They want to know crowd control and it maps to make sure that you know when they go in Jeddah, they do the pilgrimage. There is a lot of sometimes there's hundreds of people dying because they go. They so they can prevent they try many technologies start working, they still have the problem. They think we are the solution. I made a quotation of $3 per device per month, 5 million units for 10 years. This is to tell you from the small to the big military. It could be. It is. We're going to get 600,000 budget with the Navy. By, they told me, by, within six months this, this is going to go to 1.9 million, and then when we have the product at exactly one it's they told me, there is no limit, right? Got it. Margot, who you mentioned, right now the revenue is somewhere around 600k Arr, what's the, what's the fraction of it? Where is it coming from? What kind of users?
Now let me add something that I usually don't say we have another technology that we are working on. It's called UW radar that will detect people even if they have no electronics. So you put them on on the drones, and it will detect people even if they have nothing on them. And how does that work? Is it? Is it through computer vision? And how is that working?

And with ATAC, they have the map, and they can they see, where is everybody, when the GPS, they see nothing. Yeah. So by integrating our technology in there, they're going to be able to restore and even be able to connect and see people inside business, where they are, right, because that should actually use market that can humongous market. The other market, we went to Neo, I don't know if you know, in Saudi there is this new city that was 171 kilometer long that they reduced it to 4.2 kilometer. Yeah, yeah. They were sent. They were spending three and a half in there. They do 4.2 kilometer. Now they're doing it. They're going to open by 2030 but still spending 400 billion in this. So this is smaller, but it's still going. So we went there. They were so amazed by the technology. They want to put it in, in the city courts, building city codes for neon, yeah, and then later to extend into the country. So what this will do when they send the drones with our technology, they will be able to detect to see crowd control heat maps, if there is a problem, where is the closest security guard to send him? So there is so many use cases for them. It's available. So right now, we have the three biggest market. We are already working. We are generating some revenue, very little 50 last year. This year will be probably 600,000 2 million. Next year is going to be probably three to 5 million. And then 2027 this is 2026 this is when we start going up right interesting Marco, and one question on the previous use case. Marco, let's say if you're detecting people based on their cell phone signals, how are you able to differentiate whether this is one person? This specific person is a security guard versus an normal citizen, versus x, y, z, okay. Is it a security guard, you know is a print so you know who it is. You have the you have information, so you know it's if it's somebody else you don't know, but if there is any, and this is what I'm hearing from the south, from the southeast, because here, I don't think you can do it in London or in the US, yeah. But if there is any fraction, you have the right to go to the telco and ask for this print the E, l, e, i, what? What would it belong to? And you have the phone number and the name of the person got it Understood, understood. So one, what's the plan? When? When do you plan to shift from more of a product based solution to integrating everything on the mobile app and becoming more of a software player? Okay? So we are right now. We are proving everything with the hardware or hardware. Yeah, as soon as we have permission from we have access the API access from Android and iOS. This is when we start migrating everything. So I think already Android is releasing APIs, so we are looking into it. So my guess knowing how slow things are, but by the end of next year, this is when this is going to happen. In the meantime, the military, they don't want any integration. They want to have something. They want to own, because our business model is it's just a service. So we have two kind of customers that customers of customers would be like Karski Maya more in Singapore, for example, they have 12,000 square meter. We quoted them 15,000 US per month for the per month, and it's the money is coming from security, from cleaning, because I want to make sure people are saying enough time in each room, because so they can see that. And it's also for delivery, which is extremely important. You know, for example, grab. It's like Uber Eats the grant needs in Singapore, you don't deliver within 20 minutes. They don't the customer does not pay, yeah, so they need to know exactly they have a problem with the last and you know, when you are the most it meter is a big problem, right? And the big one, like for Saudi, we got this inquiry for 5 million people immigration. They want to know crowd control and it maps to make sure that you know when they go in Jeddah, they do the pilgrimage. There is a lot of sometimes there's hundreds of people dying because they go. They so they can prevent they try many technologies start working, they still have the problem. They think we are the solution. I made a quotation of $3 per device per month, 5 million units for 10 years. This is to tell you from the small to the big military. It could be. It is. We're going to get 600,000 budget with the Navy. By, they told me, by, within six months this, this is going to go to 1.9 million, and then when we have the product at exactly one it's they told me, there is no limit, right? Got it. Margot, who you mentioned, right now the revenue is somewhere around 600k Arr, what's the, what's the fraction of it? Where is it coming from? What kind of users?
Now let me add something that I usually don't say we have another technology that we are working on. It's called UW radar that will detect people even if they have no electronics. So you put them on on the drones, and it will detect people even if they have nothing on them. And how does that work? Is it? Is it through computer vision? And how is that working? It's, it's not vision AI. It's basically being able to detect mass of people moving. Well, if they don't move, we can't find them, but if they move, you can have the movement like a radar. It has the same technology of the radar, and they will detect interesting data, interesting Marco and yes, please go ahead. Now. The really cool thing about I think, and this is something that will be very attractive to, I think, Qualcomm and other big corporation, is that when we gone, we got because our technology is only, it's not the hardware, the hardware, when we start building the hardware, phones did not have that. Now, all the phones, cars, they have with Hawaii dance, because that's an our IP is only predictive location algorithm. So in the future, everything is going to go it going to migrate into the cell phones. As soon as we're going to be able to access the cloud band in the phone, we're going to be able to put our technology into the phone. So with our app people, we can create private mesh network and locate every RF that every move, moving phone or every moving even if they have Bluetooth, yeah, they'd be able to localize, and that's where there's a huge, huge market besides, of course, the meter, right, right? Yeah, that, that would certainly be game changing, for sure. Right now. Marco from, from the perspective of a physical device, beyond first responders. What are the markets? Do you see using this? Okay, we have to, we have the military. We are just entering into a contract with the lady. And we are also going to enter in the control of the Air Force. The biggest problem right now in military is that in combat zone, GPS is shocked. So people, they don't know where the trucks are, they don't know where the soldiers are, and it's a nightmare. So there is a huge push from the unit from DOD to find new solution of that cannot be jammed. And because we are using ultra wideband, with cloudband active GPS is very low. Spectrum is up to one gigahertz, and but we are between, we have three to 9.5 gigahertz. So it's that's why they call it intra wideband, and it's pretty impossible to jam the entire spectrum. If you do do some of the spectrum, you need so much power, so we're going to be able to detect where you are, where the camera is. So they cannot do that, yeah, because that's why the Air Force and the the Navy is very interested. The detail too much because of under NDA. But yes, it's basically also mostly with, with the drones, when they lose GPS, so they will be able not to lose DPS anymore. It will be soldiers, this mountain soldiers, you know, they have, they all have the S 22 Samsung that they were here, and they have an app called ATAC.

25:25Ticker. Name is Nn. I think he's working with Nexa
S Speaker 125:31They do Z and but they don't do the protest deployment. They have five typicals with cell towers. That's how they do the Z, actually. So you know, the CEO of next time we just stepped down is joining us. Because if I and as advisor and it, the market capitalization of next time is 1 billion, and we are head of them with technology, they can, but we are behind them in terms of sets where maybe one year behind them, right, right? This is a big gap in between. I'm, you know, I'm open for migration. That's, you know, I just want to get things done, got it Understood, understood. And have you had, have you closed any of the 10 million round yet? Or are you early in the process? No, no, I didn't. But I know that I have people I need. I need to find someone that we did the rounds. I know that Pm is interested to invest. You know, before we were supposed to be investing in in we signed 3m in january 2023 and 3m said we bringing on the table general catalyst from New York to do the route and to lead the run and to price it. Yeah. But just after that, Silicon Valley Bank went bust, and all the DC stopped doing business, everybody. So what I've done, I've asked my actual investment to step up and give us more cash, which we have now, and we get as much cash as we need, but now we need to align ourselves with the big name Qualcomm. Would be fantastic. If you are interested. I'm sure pm would be interested. I'm sure I can get also Lockheed Martin.

S Speaker 127:30I'm sure I can get RTX. It's going to be easy, but I need somebody, if I can say to somebody that takes a lead, okay, I have Qualcomm. I have it, they will do it. So I'm trying to collect companies like you. Yeah, they will put 234, 5 million,
I'm sure I can get RTX. It's going to be easy, but I need somebody, if I can say to somebody that takes a lead, okay, I have Qualcomm. I have it, they will do it. So I'm trying to collect companies like you. Yeah, they will put 234, 5 million,
