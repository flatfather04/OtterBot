S Speaker 11:09just a second. I think we'll also be joining. So let's just wait a minute for him as well, because I just want to keep him in loop. Yeah. So yeah. But from the questions perspective, do you think those are very high, those are still very high level? Do you think you have answers for most of them, perfect, perfect. So we can quickly go through that today, and then I think the training have some more things to add. So we can, we can discuss that. Apart from that, how is the thing going? Do you see the progression of sort of next model launch coming up as well? Yes, pretty

1:41good. I will say the progress is pretty good. Yeah. So
good. I will say the progress is pretty good. Yeah. So
good. I will say the progress is pretty good. Yeah. So
good. I will say the progress is pretty good. Yeah. So
S Speaker 21:44I think we will soon be able to, will be able to release that to some users, around 100 Google users, around two weeks, and send you the link, because it's a developing version. It might not be uptime all the day. And some, we know, some measures also blog the link for some reason, and it allows you to change the emotion and do whatever you want. Is basically a new version of our existing model. It increase a lot in the in the terms of stability, right, and yeah, and maybe I can show you some demos before we Continue questions.

S Speaker 32:39Yes, thanks for the call. Maybe setting we are our concerns, or the big questions that we have is, so what? So? One is, you know, what's exciting for us is that you have models that can run on edge today. Yeah, I think for us, that is very, very exciting. And then we have customers across every vertical, whether it's PC, automotive, IoT, that they all would seek for something like this, the concerns is, is the tech commodity? Or Fast Forward one year from now, does the tech become commodity? And which is fine. We've seen like, even if the tech is commodity, then essentially you need to have entrenched products, right? Like products where the cost of switching is low eventually. So right now, it's great that you have amazing consumer traction to have some sticks into the product. So So I think understanding how like is there is our understanding correct from your perspective, from a technology standpoint as well. And then, and then, how are you thinking about product, and how are you thinking about

the future of the company?
S Speaker 24:07So I think I can answer all this kind of question, but maybe let me do a demo first, and as all the answers to your questions and answer that we can discuss more about future, the next step extra, yeah, and to know where are we now at the decision process of, like, a Qualcomm interest, like,

S Speaker 34:34oh, we, I mean, we just had one meeting before, right? Yeah, discuss with our team. There's definitely some interest. And then I want to discuss the like, the construct of if we were to come in, and what would that mean like, right? And then just want to discuss that with you and see how you feel about it. And then we can talk more. Okay, let's see the demo, and then let's learn about these questions that I have, and then we can talk about the constructs of what a deal if we were to come in, and what would that mean?

5:14as you can see it,
S Speaker 45:17I've been saving for three years. And finally, finally, we can go. The look on your face right now is worth every extra shift that I worked after everything we've been through. I can't believe you would betray me like this. I gave you everything, and now I'm left with nothing but memories and broken promises. As

okay, carta carte is 150 milliseconds. Now I
okay, carta carte is 150 milliseconds. Now I
okay, carta carte is 150 milliseconds. Now I
8:52think it's 200 to 300 millisecond.

think it's 200 to 300 millisecond.
think it's 200 to 300 millisecond.
S Speaker 38:57No. So this is even like from a latency standpoint, it's faster, much faster. You're saying,
No. So this is even like from a latency standpoint, it's faster, much faster. You're saying,
No. So this is even like from a latency standpoint, it's faster, much faster. You're saying,
No. So this is even like from a latency standpoint, it's faster, much faster. You're saying,
S Speaker 310:50That's that's pretty good. Actually, we should have added one other person on our team who manages partnerships with Qualcomm. It would be Sergio. We'll have you introduce you to him as well, so that, because we get all these requirements from the business, and I think we, I believe we got some more on voice models, for what latency they wanted, and everything, and we could map it for different business units, but, but this is okay. So that's and so, and at some point, so to answer this, then, which is, does this become? See, I'm not saying like, like, you know the quality. There's, what are the vectors of voice performance? One is like, like, the voice performance is, one is quality, and then quality could be a function of lot of different things. Like, you just showed the demo, right? And then the second one is latency, and then a third one is cost, right? And do you think, like, like, if I just quickly, like, looked at, you know this? Car teachers website. They're on the website, they say 40 milliseconds time to first audio, right? Yeah, I get it. And then they're probably showing that on their website, and then they're not include time to first token from the LLM and everything right? Like they're assuming that the total available, but at some point this, everything gets close enough, right? Or no,
That's that's pretty good. Actually, we should have added one other person on our team who manages partnerships with Qualcomm. It would be Sergio.

S Speaker 212:38But, you know, I'm not sure, because, to my mind, the developing of 11 labs and the is not pretty fast right now. For some reason they didn't launch some model ICU, you know, amazing in the last couple of months, which, you know, AI company generally runs a lot faster, as usual companies and what we see is say, actually, it's hard to hit both. You want to be fast, you want to be you want to be cost effective, and you want the emotion to be good. It's hard before today. So what happens is, today our TDs model is no longer a small TDs model. It also has the context of your previous speech. That's why we are able to cut down the latency to five to 10 tokens. You can imagine, in the first in the first sentence, the model is talking with user. It may not perform pretty good emotion because it doesn't have the entire context. It has the user's check, has some information, but it doesn't have the entire context. It may perform a little bit lower than the model we just show, but when the user begin chatting on the second row, it actually because it is a multi modality model, the model also gets what will be the text, what will be authentic. So that case, the model understand the content, understand that emotion, and it follows the previous sentence. And this means the model can give the users a good emotion, a good response, in a short time. That's basically how we do that. Yeah, okay, got it,

So that case, the model understand the content, understand that emotion, and it follows the previous sentence. And this means the model can give the users a good emotion, a good response, in a short time. That's basically how we do that. Yeah, okay, got it,
But, you know, I'm not sure, because, to my mind, the developing of 11 labs and the is not pretty fast right now. For some reason they didn't launch some model ICU, you know, amazing in the last couple of months, which, you know, AI company generally runs a lot faster, as usual companies and what we see is say, actually, it's hard to hit both. You want to be fast, you want to be you want to be cost effective, and you want the emotion to be good. It's hard before today. So what happens is, today our TDs model is no longer a small TDs model. It also has the context of your previous speech. That's why we are able to cut down the latency to five to 10 tokens. You can imagine, in the first in the first sentence, the model is talking with user. It may not perform pretty good emotion because it doesn't have the entire context. It has the user's check, has some information, but it doesn't have the entire context. It may perform a little bit lower than the model we just show, but when the user begin chatting on the second row, it actually because it is a multi modality model, the model also gets what will be the text, what will be authentic. So that case, the model understand the content, understand that emotion, and it follows the previous sentence. And this means the model can give the users a good emotion, a good response, in a short time. That's basically how we do that. Yeah, okay, got it,
14:17yeah, but we may go through the question. So the next question,
yeah, but we may go through the question. So the next question,
yeah, but we may go through the question. So the next question,
yeah, but we may go through the question. So the next question,
S Speaker 217:29I imagine we are a consumer tool or AI tool, if air company has memory, has all the chat history with you, has engagement, the perfect the fish audio. Fish audio. On the other side, we have record user has uploaded lots of their voice, their friends voice, the people of they know, the celebrities upload lots of voice in the system. And that will be very important part. Because if they want to move another platform, they need to, you know, they need to move all these kind of waste they created and all the projects they created to another platform, which is, I don't think it's possible.

S Speaker 318:13And so this app
18:18would be like a mobile app.
would be like a mobile app.
would be like a mobile app.
would be like a mobile app.
S Speaker 318:23And is that like? Are you, you know, remember that company inflection, that they had that pie? Yeah, companion. Is that how like? Is that how you envision? And I think they got acquired at Microsoft, but, but I don't know if they still have that companion app. But is that the plan?
And is that like? Are you, you know, remember that company inflection, that they had that pie? Yeah, companion. Is that how like? Is that how you envision? And I think they got acquired at Microsoft, but, but I don't know if they still have that companion app. But is that the plan?

S Speaker 218:43Our idea is we don't want there to be an app there. There will be an app served as your wallet, so as AI companions wallet, as some kind of interface, but it will not be the core so we want the user to be able to engage with AI all i messages on messages on phone call online or WhatsApp, instead of a special app designed for AI companion, that means they can add a companion to their friends group. They can talk with AI companion, and this requires a lot of engineering effort. But luckily, that's who we are. If you gig with our experience little bit, you'll find almost all our core members has backgrounds a scraping this kind of cyber security stuff. Yeah, that's why we are able to build and deliver stuff like that. Yeah,
Our idea is we don't want there to be an app there.

S Speaker 319:42you're gonna have, like, you're gonna have a presence. Doesn't like you want to have a presence on, on what's WhatsApp chat body want to interact with I message. You can do that. You can do we will
you're gonna have, like, you're gonna have a presence. Doesn't like you want to have a presence on, on what's WhatsApp chat body want to interact with I message. You can do that. You can do we will

S Speaker 219:52say the presence in the internet, but just like a new person, it should have its own social media accounts on a chat icons, messaging accounts. So imagine when they have the social media accounts and they search similar terms to you will get natural feed flow from tick tock from Twitter, just that, just like what the users really see every day, and this flow will drive the retention and the engagement. Yeah.
say the presence in the internet, but just like a new person, it should have its own social media accounts on a chat icons, messaging accounts.

S Speaker 320:24what's your and so two questions. One, when do you want to build this and ship this after
what's your and so two questions. One, when do you want to build this and ship this after
what's your and so two questions. One, when do you want to build this and ship this after
what's your and so two questions. One, when do you want to build this and ship this after
S Speaker 220:34two months, after we have finished the launch of the new model as well. We are preparing a big launch, a huge launch for that. We want to make this technology known by more people, and I think it's a game changer. So until nowadays, text, speech and voice is still a prosumer game. Only professional users use it to create contents most talent. But when you refer to the you can check the history of mid journey, the history of sono. What they did initially, people also thought image and audio or lyrics can only be created by, you know, prosumers. But later on, when there's me journey, when there is a lot of AI opinion when there is chat, GPT joint image, when there is so no audio or writing, audio, writing lyrics. This is changed. Everyone in the world be able to participate. Everyone be able to we call it democratize, democratize, and everyone be able to generate the content they like. This was also what's going to happen in the audio. So another thing that change a lot is as an even the workflow for prosumers. So right now, if you go to 11 labs and you have a you have a script, you want 11 labs to come to voice over that, right? And it follows your instruction, you generate 1000 times. Maybe you can get a new clip and perfectly match. Imagine your mind. But with our new model, you generate one time. Maybe it matches, if there's at most 10 times, because you can adjust the motion, adjust everything. And then when you have this kind of
two months, after we have finished the launch of the new model as well. We are preparing a big launch, a huge launch for that.

22:22generated content.
S Speaker 222:24It actually changed the entire workflow. Previously. You need to go to go to work. Who is human, or who is human? Voice actor. Tell them, I want to record and send the script. And they record that. They feel that's good. They send it to you. You may find it doesn't match your imagination, but this is your choice to rather ask them to record again. Take another five days, three days, or you accept that. But for AI, you don't need to have toilet. When you are not satisfied, you just regenerate. You really want your mouse and you get a new audio clip.

22:57Yeah, that's a good point.
Yeah, that's a good point.
Yeah, that's a good point.
Yeah, that's a good point.
S Speaker 323:02And, so what's your plan? How do you, you know how, like, 11 Labs has been great at marketing. They do this. I mean, I would say that's one of the key strengths. Yeah, and and that's allowed them to scale to where they are today. What like? How do you think you want to have you thought about how you want to go spread awareness. How do you want to market this? How do you build awareness? Because now, in a sea where you have a bunch of others, how do you differentiate yourself and how do you want to market? Send that message
And, so what's your plan? How do you, you know how, like, 11 Labs has been great at marketing. They do this. I mean, I would say that's one of the key strengths.

S Speaker 223:50to going to focus on consumer and the consumer market, instead of B to B. So I think these questions carefully. Let me, let me ask you a question, where do you think is open AI's mode? Besides, I mean, the technology have, because nowadays Gemini and, you know, cloud, they're also on the same level. What's their mode
to going to focus on consumer and the consumer market, instead of B to B. So I think these questions carefully. Let me, let me ask you a question, where do you think is open AI's mode?

Besides, I mean, the technology have, because nowadays Gemini and, you know, cloud, they're also on the same level. What's their mode
S Speaker 324:13distribution? Open, AI is mode. Now, at this point, the biggest mode is, is, at this point, they built a consumer brand. They built a consumer brand that not just you and me in the Silicon Valley. They know about it. Yeah, it's your parents and grandparents, and everybody knows about chat GBT around the globe. So they've got that distribution and then now switching from chat GPT if, let's say, for example, Claude, in their app was to say, I have a 20% better model. Doesn't matter. So it's now their moat is product velocity distribution web distribution first and then continue on. Product velocity, not, not just like model velocity, it's product right, like your shipping agent,

S Speaker 225:12yeah, and yeah, the model is chat GPT. And what's the difference between the chat GPT and the other AI companies app will see that you find cloud setup and Geminis app doesn't work that well. They lack many core features because, like Gemini memory is like joke for right now. They don't have memory across conversations, and they lack many features and cloud. It's so slow, many reject to give you a response, say we are out of capacity. We are serving the API users. So right now, if you will, take a look to 11 labs and player sheet and all these competitors, all of them are doing B to B, nobody really cares, and doing shit with consumer and consumer marketing, and you see 11 less growth from consumer and consumer. They get a lot of revenue before they go B to B, but they don't believe that. They don't, they don't trust that they don't continue improve their model to make a model that can go viral, that everyone the world can use. They can say they just go to B to B, because B to B when you are doing a coincidence, it's just no emotion. You just need to be cheap, to be fast. And in that case, there will be a lot of comparison with B to B, and they don't have so that's why we are building more focus on consumer and production. We build the most model and build application layer.
yeah, and yeah, the model is chat GPT. And what's the difference between the chat GPT and the other AI companies app will see that you find cloud setup and Geminis app doesn't work that well.

S Speaker 326:45So you're being contrarian here, because, you know, most people were, is more if you were to ask more people, most people, they would say, I want to go across Zoomer and then enterprise, because enterprise builds repeatable sales portions, because with typically what you see with prosumer is you see high churns. Now, of course, chat GPT had churned initially, but not anymore, because the truth is, chat GPT just provided so much value to the end user that that their churn has significantly reduced. Building a consumer business is very, very hard, but if you build a good consumer business, then it's nothing like it. So, so why do you like now? Then that brings me back to the value. Forget model quality for a second. I get it that you're going after building the best model quality. But then, like, how do you build this value? Because eventually, from from an from an AI, you know, like, if you go to the mobile app store today, there's a bunch of these chat bot, type of applications that are trying to build your AI, you know, assistant and similar persona, which is, if you're lonely, then you can talk to them, and all those AI, girlfriend, boyfriend, yeah, there's, like, It's filled with ton of them. How, like, what's your value proposition that you think that you can build a strong consumer product and a strong consumer brand. So
So you're being contrarian here, because, you know, most people were, is more if you were to ask more people, most people, they would say, I want to go across Zoomer and then enterprise, because enterprise builds repeatable sales portions, because with typically what you see with prosumer is you see high churns. Now, of course, chat GPT had churned initially, but not anymore, because the truth is, chat GPT just provided so much value to the end user that that their churn has significantly reduced. Building a consumer business is very, very hard, but if you build a good consumer business, then it's nothing like it. So, so why do you like now? Then that brings me back to the value. Forget model quality for a second. I get it that you're going after building the best model quality. But then, like, how do you build this value?

S Speaker 228:32I think the question is still, here, do you give a try to this kind of app? Beautiful, the only people I
I think the question is still, here, do you give a try to this kind of app? Beautiful, the only people I
I think the question is still, here, do you give a try to this kind of app? Beautiful, the only people I
I think the question is still, here, do you give a try to this kind of app? Beautiful, the only people I
S Speaker 328:38haven't, but, but, if you go to the App Store, there's a whole bunch, right? There's whole bunch. And then there was, I don't know how character AI is doing now, but character AI clearly initially had, like, a very high usage, yeah,
haven't, but, but, if you go to the App Store, there's a whole bunch, right? There's whole bunch. And then there was, I don't know how character AI is doing now, but character AI clearly initially had, like, a very high usage, yeah,
haven't, but, but, if you go to the App Store, there's a whole bunch, right? There's whole bunch. And then there was, I don't know how character AI is doing now, but character AI clearly initially had, like, a very high usage, yeah,

S Speaker 228:56characterized you almost a lot is now. So the question is, in the customer market, it's always, if you are the first people doing something, you go viral, and you get a customer, and if you are doing not doing shit, your customer will return, just like chat, GPT, just like character, AI. And this is what actually going on in the market, right? And of these, all these kind of competitors, will not call them competitor, but imagine they are not AI companion. None of them are companion. AI is name tell its character is role playing for all these kind of company, you need to provide information to the AI in a specific app. This limits a lot of things. This doesn't allow you to when you are working many people, they are lonely, right? They don't definitely want to. They definitely don't want to show other people they are long. In most cases, people don't want to show that and they don't want to open a chatbot app when they are watching but if it is, iMessage is just text. Baby can't get a coffee and keeps that and nobody will find something unusual is just hidden in the person's daily routine, daily work, it looks so usual, so convenient. I think that will be our breaking point. And another point is, when we integrate the real world feed flow, it becomes a different species. Is no longer a role play. It just becomes the true air convenient. It brings new information. And I think that will be the call to maintain a long term engagement. And then when you have these features together, you have to, you have a mind blowing app in the world go viral. And also, of course, it needs when you do some marketing, but it natively has the potential to go viral because it's not the same. App is no longer a role play check, but it's a different thing. I just like, you know, chat GPT, I think there are lots of AI app following chat GPT, there are lots of them, but none of them has a large volume. And before chat GPT, I think there are also some kind of AI tools app, but they don't hit a point, and nobody is doing them after chatgpt. So I think that will be the case for us create a good enough app, a good enough product, both fish audio and fill in or, sorry, our next engineer product, they will go viral when we have the market, and I think the cheapest traffic in the world, compared to just buy traffic from from your competitors, buy that directly on the internet, doing something great and make it go viral. Get organic traffic is the cheapest way we can get the you know, the traffic, otherwise, you need to wait for, I say, a long time before you can always need to spend a lot of money to buy the users. Okay, that's and
characterized you almost a lot is now. So the question is, in the customer market, it's always, if you are the first people doing something, you go viral, and you get a customer, and if you are doing not doing shit, your customer will return, just like chat, GPT, just like character, AI.

Okay, that's and
S Speaker 332:20and then, how do you want to market this, which is what's like, how do you think you want to spread awareness of this, which is in the selling the message that you have, which is building a true assistant. How do you want to market do you want to be more worn out, or do you want to be do you want to go for land grab,
and then, how do you want to market this, which is what's like, how do you think you want to spread awareness of this, which is in the selling the message that you have, which is building a true assistant. How do you want to market do you want to be more worn out, or do you want to be do you want to go for land grab,

33:26we are thinking of that, and
we are thinking of that, and

we are thinking of that, and
S Speaker 733:41definitely find Twitter, but I think
definitely find Twitter, but I think
definitely find Twitter, but I think
definitely find Twitter, but I think
S Speaker 334:29forward. Okay? And she did. One question that we will have is, like, because we're corporate, is this like a lot of AI, girlfriend, boyfriend type of use cases.
forward. Okay? And she did. One question that we will have is, like, because we're corporate, is this like a lot of AI, girlfriend, boyfriend type of use cases.
forward. Okay? And she did. One question that we will have is, like, because we're corporate, is this like a lot of AI, girlfriend, boyfriend type of use cases.
forward. Okay? And she did. One question that we will have is, like, because we're corporate, is this like a lot of AI, girlfriend, boyfriend type of use cases.
S Speaker 234:43Oh, you mean chest, fish audio, yes, not more prosumer, just more consumer. Yeah,
Oh, you mean chest, fish audio, yes, not more prosumer, just more consumer. Yeah,
Oh, you mean chest, fish audio, yes, not more prosumer, just more consumer. Yeah,
Oh, you mean chest, fish audio, yes, not more prosumer, just more consumer. Yeah,
34:57our chat bot app,
S Speaker 334:58yes, yeah, it's not like when you do like these companion, yeah, it
yes, yeah, it's not like when you do like these companion, yeah, it
yes, yeah, it's not like when you do like these companion, yeah, it
yes, yeah, it's not like when you do like these companion, yeah, it
S Speaker 235:03should be a lot AI girlfriend use cases when it becomes AI companion, yeah,
should be a lot AI girlfriend use cases when it becomes AI companion, yeah,
should be a lot AI girlfriend use cases when it becomes AI companion, yeah,
should be a lot AI girlfriend use cases when it becomes AI companion, yeah,
S Speaker 335:11yeah. So that's something that we like to think about for us.
yeah. So that's something that we like to think about for us.
yeah. So that's something that we like to think about for us.
yeah. So that's something that we like to think about for us.
35:15Why, by the way,
S Speaker 335:20there's a, you know, there's always like with that content. A lot of times it becomes like Not Safe For Work type of content as well. And then, as a corporate like, the corporate guidelines might not allow us to do that, right? Yeah, so because so with the Not, not safe of, as you can imagine, like, you know, our corporate is very wary of, of any backlash on brand imaging, yeah, so, so that could be, That's something that I was like, I was thinking, Yeah,
there's a, you know, there's always like with that content. A lot of times it becomes like Not Safe For Work type of content as well. And then, as a corporate like, the corporate guidelines might not allow us to do that, right? Yeah, so because so with the Not, not safe of, as you can imagine, like, you know, our corporate is very wary of, of any backlash on brand imaging, yeah, so, so that could be, That's something that I was like, I was thinking, Yeah,

Yeah, so because so with the Not, not safe of, as you can imagine, like, you know, our corporate is very wary of, of any backlash on brand imaging, yeah, so, so that could be, That's something that I was like, I was thinking, Yeah,
S Speaker 337:49way. Like, are you not allowing an SFW content? Is the question. Like, like, for example, I think on chatgpt, there is no they don't allow NSW content, right? Choose
way. Like, are you not allowing an SFW content? Is the question. Like, like, for example, I think on chatgpt, there is no they don't allow NSW content, right? Choose
way. Like, are you not allowing an SFW content? Is the question. Like, like, for example, I think on chatgpt, there is no they don't allow NSW content, right? Choose
way. Like, are you not allowing an SFW content? Is the question. Like, like, for example, I think on chatgpt, there is no they don't allow NSW content, right? Choose
S Speaker 238:0150 actually allows. Allows, yeah, they just removed. Don't allow SMW from their term of use recently.
50 actually allows. Allows, yeah, they just removed. Don't allow SMW from their term of use recently.
50 actually allows. Allows, yeah, they just removed. Don't allow SMW from their term of use recently.
50 actually allows. Allows, yeah, they just removed. Don't allow SMW from their term of use recently.
38:08Oh, really, yeah,
S Speaker 238:13that's a sad but we don't want to get user to engage with SFW content. We will try to blow them as much as possible. The new app.
that's a sad but we don't want to get user to engage with SFW content. We will try to blow them as much as possible. The new app.
that's a sad but we don't want to get user to engage with SFW content. We will try to blow them as much as possible. The new app.
that's a sad but we don't want to get user to engage with SFW content. We will try to blow them as much as possible. The new app.
38:29And okay, got it.
38:30Maybe we need to go through the answers.
Maybe we need to go through the answers.
Maybe we need to go through the answers.
Maybe we need to go through the answers.
S Speaker 238:34So then is the price, how much we spend? Please keep this confidential. Is a COVID information, and right now our cost for our TTS model is only 3% of the like the selling price.
So then is the price, how much we spend? Please keep this confidential. Is a COVID information, and right now our cost for our TTS model is only 3% of the like the selling price.
So then is the price, how much we spend? Please keep this confidential. Is a COVID information, and right now our cost for our TTS model is only 3% of the like the selling price.
So then is the price, how much we spend? Please keep this confidential. Is a COVID information, and right now our cost for our TTS model is only 3% of the like the selling price.
S Speaker 338:52Oh, wow. So your gross margin 97% 97% gross margin. Yeah, that's pretty good. Yeah,
Oh, wow. So your gross margin 97% 97% gross margin. Yeah, that's pretty good. Yeah,
Oh, wow. So your gross margin 97% 97% gross margin. Yeah, that's pretty good. Yeah,
Oh, wow. So your gross margin 97% 97% gross margin. Yeah, that's pretty good. Yeah,
S Speaker 239:04and we are already cheaper than 11 left. So we are thinking in a national realm, one if we want to encourage B to B use cases, we haven't decided yet. We don't think we will encourage a lot if we want to encourage we will just cut a price to maybe $2 per million characters and just kill everyone in the market. You can imagine, in 11 labs or in criteria secure in the business model,
and we are already cheaper than 11 left. So we are thinking in a national realm, one if we want to encourage B to B use cases, we haven't decided yet. We don't think we will encourage a lot if we want to encourage we will just cut a price to maybe $2 per million characters and just kill everyone in the market.

39:33price goes from $15 to $2
price goes from $15 to $2
price goes from $15 to $2
price goes from $15 to $2
39:42Wow. Okay, that's,
S Speaker 339:47this is so so your model, in comparison to like a Cartesian or 11 labs right now, is already significantly smaller for this, for same quality or better quality,
this is so so your model, in comparison to like a Cartesian or 11 labs right now, is already significantly smaller for this, for same quality or better quality,
this is so so your model, in comparison to like a Cartesian or 11 labs right now, is already significantly smaller for this, for same quality or better quality,
this is so so your model, in comparison to like a Cartesian or 11 labs right now, is already significantly smaller for this, for same quality or better quality,
S Speaker 239:58we're already not significantly smaller, I would say, in many cases. But we do a lot optimization in the influence. We do our own we have our own engineering team working on influence. And the lead of that team, this team of two people, not a big team, comes from finance. He was previously working for the inference for dopamine, yeah, interesting. And so we have our own inference framework. We rewrite the FG line, and we have our own PD separation. We have implement our own lots of models and make them streamable, make a lot of things there to cut on the latency and cut on the cost,
we're already not significantly smaller, I would say, in many cases. But we do a lot optimization in the influence. We do our own we have our own engineering team working on influence.

40:46that's pretty good, impressive, yeah,
that's pretty good, impressive, yeah,
that's pretty good, impressive, yeah,
that's pretty good, impressive, yeah,
S Speaker 240:49and there's still a room to make the price even lower. The cost, I would say, in at the end of this year, probably goes to 0.1 dollar per million characters, and then we have labeled 1000 hours data from our side. That's what we showed you last time the data was in motion on him by human and we use it to tune our speech text model, and we use the model to label the 100k hours of data, and now working on another 300k hours data, and our entire data for changing training the new model as a round the one to 1.5 million hours.

The cost, I would say, in at the end of this year, probably goes to 0.1 dollar per million characters, and then we have labeled 1000 hours data from our side. That's what we showed you last time the data was in motion on him by human and we use it to tune our speech text model, and we use the model to label the 100k hours of data, and now working on another 300k hours data, and our entire data for changing training the new model as a round the one to 1.5 million hours.

S Speaker 242:27names? Well, OHA is more like for acquiring talent, the name and the brand we want to later on, more some talents to focus on research and not actually related to the product line, they just need to dive deep, see how to build an even crazy, even better model, even better data. That's what they are going to do. So we are splitting the brand internally. We will call open audio, the research lab, and it delivers model to feature audio and later on the air company app. But
names? Well, OHA is more like for acquiring talent, the name and the brand we want to later on, more some talents to focus on research and not actually related to the product line, they just need to dive deep, see how to build an even crazy, even better model, even better data.

43:06okay, got it. That's good,
okay, got it. That's good,
okay, got it. That's good,
okay, got it. That's good,
43:09yeah, and yeah and
S Speaker 243:13so to card the step to copy, it's actually time. So even they know we are doing that they want to annotate 1000 hours of data.
so to card the step to copy, it's actually time. So even they know we are doing that they want to annotate 1000 hours of data.
so to card the step to copy, it's actually time. So even they know we are doing that they want to annotate 1000 hours of data.
so to card the step to copy, it's actually time. So even they know we are doing that they want to annotate 1000 hours of data.
S Speaker 243:27It needs time. We have people working in China to full time managing the annotating team and to annotate data. And we expect, if they want to replicate a data annotation. The size of data they need around three to four months. And then, when they have the first version of ASR model, they replace fix their pipeline. They need another two three months to annotate 100k hours, or 300k hours of data before they can train a model. And then they have some UA, it will be more than half year of time window we have. And if we have half year of time window, and we still can't push the product in the market and let a lot of people adopt that, I mean, we shouldn't do this business. Yeah, in that
It needs time. We have people working in China to full time managing the annotating team and to annotate data. And we expect, if they want to replicate a data annotation.

S Speaker 244:23I think this is what you also care about, the traction and retention. So we calculate the income this week and put it into annualized revenue is 4.9 2 million, so it's 1 million, around one minute increase compared to
I think this is what you also care about, the traction and retention. So we calculate the income this week and put it into annualized revenue is 4.9 2 million, so it's 1 million, around one minute increase compared to
I think this is what you also care about, the traction and retention. So we calculate the income this week and put it into annualized revenue is 4.9 2 million, so it's 1 million, around one minute increase compared to

S Speaker 344:46Oh, which is how much increase from HF 0 million?
Oh, which is how much increase from HF 0 million?
Oh, which is how much increase from HF 0 million?
Oh, which is how much increase from HF 0 million?
44:53Oh, HF zero, Demo Day was 4 million,
Oh, HF zero, Demo Day was 4 million,
Oh, HF zero, Demo Day was 4 million,
Oh, HF zero, Demo Day was 4 million,
S Speaker 244:55yeah. And we did, we did some sales in the head at the moment. Yeah.
yeah. And we did, we did some sales in the head at the moment. Yeah.
yeah. And we did, we did some sales in the head at the moment. Yeah.
yeah. And we did, we did some sales in the head at the moment. Yeah.
S Speaker 345:00Okay, so, so you added, what, 1 million in but, but, but you are like, so this Z, really, at the end of last year, like January, you 400k Right, yeah, 500k Yeah, got it. Got it. Got it. Okay, so you added 1 million since such a zero Demo Day,
Okay, so, so you added, what, 1 million in but, but, but you are like, so this Z, really, at the end of last year, like January, you 400k Right, yeah, 500k Yeah, got it. Got it. Got it. Okay, so you added 1 million since such a zero Demo Day,

S Speaker 245:22okay? And then this is the retention and you can compare to the retention graph previously. I think it because it's up a month later. You can see how the retention goes. The retention didn't drop or change a lot, as you see, yeah,
okay? And then this is the retention and you can compare to the retention graph previously. I think it because it's up a month later. You can see how the retention goes. The retention didn't drop or change a lot, as you see, yeah,
okay? And then this is the retention and you can compare to the retention graph previously. I think it because it's up a month later. You can see how the retention goes. The retention didn't drop or change a lot, as you see, yeah,
okay? And then this is the retention and you can compare to the retention graph previously. I think it because it's up a month later. You can see how the retention goes. The retention didn't drop or change a lot, as you see, yeah,
45:43what was the retention? This is new. And then
what was the retention? This is new. And then
what was the retention? This is new. And then
what was the retention? This is new. And then
S Speaker 245:46yeah, this the average from the last 16 or 14 weeks. I think 16,
yeah, this the average from the last 16 or 14 weeks. I think 16,
yeah, this the average from the last 16 or 14 weeks. I think 16,
yeah, this the average from the last 16 or 14 weeks. I think 16,
S Speaker 345:54yeah, I guess retention right now is mostly you are. Your goal is to convert these monthly users to annual, right? How many monthly and how many annual right now?
yeah, I guess retention right now is mostly you are. Your goal is to convert these monthly users to annual, right? How many monthly and how many annual right now?
yeah, I guess retention right now is mostly you are. Your goal is to convert these monthly users to annual, right? How many monthly and how many annual right now?
yeah, I guess retention right now is mostly you are. Your goal is to convert these monthly users to annual, right? How many monthly and how many annual right now?

and the goal is convert most of them.
S Speaker 246:28As you can see, the annual subscribers in the week nine, week 10 drop compared to what we show last time. And we did the analysis. And this is actually quite limited, because in the last two weeks in the Azure zero download is the wide day, if you remember. And we did a sale in that moment, and we covered lot of user who generally will only buy monthly package to annual package. And these users are not typical kind of annual subscribers, and that leads to a job on the weekday, weekend retention. Yes,
As you can see, the annual subscribers in the week nine, week 10 drop compared to what we show last time. And we did the analysis.

S Speaker 347:11I think you're thinking about, let me talk about this, see for our process, and then what, how I think we can do this, which is,
I think you're thinking about, let me talk about this, see for our process, and then what, how I think we can do this, which is,

I'll send you the link in the zoom. So if you can send this to
I'll send you the link in the zoom. So if you can send this to
S Speaker 347:28this is that document that you document? Yeah, okay, so, yeah, thank you. Now, we so I'll discuss we discussed this last week. I'll discuss it again that our team and we, I think we and I can tell you about our process and everything. So we actually have this big event next week, and our international team is in San Diego next week, so we have this off site and everything. But if we were to do like, what I would like to do is get you involved with this run on, basically, and
this is that document that you document? Yeah, okay, so, yeah, thank you. Now, we so I'll discuss we discussed this last week. I'll discuss it again that our team and we, I think we and I can tell you about our process and everything.

Voice. You don't need the voice points you want to see request
S Speaker 348:22to work pretty well. So I think it'll be pretty exciting for all of those businesses, as you can imagine. And then the other business, where we are starting to see a lot of growth, and where voice is the primary interaction mechanism, is smart glasses. So you might have seen them in a smart glasses. So, like, as you can imagine, so most of the smart glasses that exist today, yeah, exactly, most of the smart glasses that exist today are using Qualcomm chips. So, and then we're already seeing a lot of inbound for, like, demand for those, and that's over there. Voice is the primary mode of interaction. In fact, it's the only mode of interaction. Yeah, like, the future is voice. For those variable technology, the future is voice. So over there, I think there'll be a lot of ways of interaction. So it's interesting. So what? That's my way of telling you this, it is interesting from several different angles. For I think you'll benefit from it as well. The big question is going to be that you have this, you raise some money investor, some angels at $100 million value right now, that's the big question for us in our consumer space, where we still have some unknowns, and then pricing it such at a price round, which is 100 is where we have multiple have challenges with the team. So my I wanted to ask you if there was any terms of the round that would be your version
to work pretty well. So I think it'll be pretty exciting for all of those businesses, as you can imagine. And then the other business, where we are starting to see a lot of growth, and where voice is the primary interaction mechanism, is smart glasses. So you might have seen them in a smart glasses.

So my I wanted to ask you if there was any terms of the round that would be your version
49:53that sounds good to you, so
that sounds good to you, so
that sounds good to you, so
that sounds good to you, so
S Speaker 349:58something that you might also like, and something that we might be okay with would be closer to 60 at this stage. So that's the, I mean, I don't know if that's something at this stage, but it's something where we get excited. We do like to work with
something that you might also like, and something that we might be okay with would be closer to 60 at this stage. So that's the, I mean, I don't know if that's something at this stage, but it's something where we get excited. We do like to work with
something that you might also like, and something that we might be okay with would be closer to 60 at this stage. So that's the, I mean, I don't know if that's something at this stage, but it's something where we get excited. We do like to work with
something that you might also like, and something that we might be okay with would be closer to 60 at this stage. So that's the, I mean, I don't know if that's something at this stage, but it's something where we get excited. We do like to work with
50:18you and and be a partner. Yeah, I think
you and and be a partner. Yeah, I think
you and and be a partner. Yeah, I think
you and and be a partner. Yeah, I think
50:24amazing. So what
S Speaker 250:27will be the difference for come to continue to make decision between, say, a 60 million and technically, what will be the difference? What will be the it
will be the difference for come to continue to make decision between, say, a 60 million and technically, what will be the difference? What will be the it
will be the difference for come to continue to make decision between, say, a 60 million and technically, what will be the difference? What will be the it
will be the difference for come to continue to make decision between, say, a 60 million and technically, what will be the difference? What will be the it
S Speaker 350:35will be a different process. Or so, see this, the way we look at this is, this is a seat check, right? See, we consider this early stage investment, and then over there. So our process for an early stage, like around 60, is much faster. It's put in, like, you know, check and and then we typically for this, you're looking at, like from here, through wiring, about three weeks,
will be a different process. Or so, see this, the way we look at this is, this is a seat check, right? See, we consider this early stage investment, and then over there. So our process for an early stage, like around 60, is much faster. It's put in, like, you know, check and and then we typically for this, you're looking at, like from here, through wiring, about three weeks,
will be a different process. Or so, see this, the way we look at this is, this is a seat check, right? See, we consider this early stage investment, and then over there.

It's put in, like, you know, check and and then we typically for this, you're looking at, like from here, through wiring, about three weeks,
51:03because you have to go from legal, I'm saying every right.
because you have to go from legal, I'm saying every right.
because you have to go from legal, I'm saying every right.
because you have to go from legal, I'm saying every right.
S Speaker 351:07But if it was like 100 then we start having like, a lot of, like, the diligence process, much longer, like, then we want to spend the risk product that the risk, if you look at churn rates, and we look at there's a lot more questions, because you're essentially saying that at this point, this company for us to meet our returns, our check sizes to be bigger, we have to say that without high confidence, this is a $500 billion outcome, right? So, so then it's a much longer process of diligence and and what that would mean, I mean, I don't even know if I can get there, right? So, so we don't start the process if I don't think like I have good shot at success of that process, right? So, so that's, that's my current thinking on this. And then so I wanted to chat with you and see how you feel about that, and if you've if you're okay with it, then, then I can run a faster
But if it was like 100 then we start having like, a lot of, like, the diligence process, much longer, like, then we want to spend the risk product that the risk, if you look at churn rates, and we look at there's a lot more questions, because you're essentially saying that at this point, this company for us to meet our returns, our check sizes to be bigger, we have to say that without high confidence, this is a $500 billion outcome, right?

And then so I wanted to chat with you and see how you feel about that, and if you've if you're okay with it, then, then I can run a faster
But if it was like 100 then we start having like, a lot of, like, the diligence process, much longer, like, then we want to spend the risk product that the risk, if you look at churn rates, and we look at there's a lot more questions, because you're essentially saying that at this point, this company for us to meet our returns, our check sizes to be bigger, we have to say that without high confidence, this is a $500 billion outcome, right? So, so then it's a much longer process of diligence and and what that would mean, I mean, I don't even know if I can get there, right? So, so we don't start the process if I don't think like I have good shot at success of that process, right? So, so that's, that's my current thinking on this.

52:16we have this event
S Speaker 352:19on Wednesday, and then we have all the international coming in on off site and everything. So then I would set up like a pitch on Monday, May 12. May 12 is a Monday, right? I think. So, yeah, yeah, I'll set up a pitch then. But then, in the meantime, we'll socialize, and then we'll get everybody up to speed, and we say, okay, broadly speaking, are we aligned on this right? Like on Monday, I'll have a good alignment with the team that, okay, broadly speaking, we're interested, right? And then we just do something called a stage two, so the same week where we do like this, you know, pitch from you, yeah, I do something called stage two, which is a discussion with the team and collect all the everybody's feedback. And then we send an email for this one. Since small check, we send an email to our IC, saying, These are the constructs. And then we send an email to the IC, and I see quotes, yes, typically, if you sending to IC, we don't like but if we are sending to IC, so my final answer to you would be the week of, right? Like, like, a verbal answer to you would be week of May 12, whether we're in or out, okay, but,
on Wednesday, and then we have all the international coming in on off site and everything. So then I would set up like a pitch on Monday, May 12. May 12 is a Monday, right? I think.

53:44Yeah, I think we can,
Yeah, I think we can,
Yeah, I think we can,
Yeah, I think we can,
S Speaker 354:12yeah. So I think that's the if you're open to it, then I would like to get access to more. Uh, data room around your like map right away.
yeah. So I think that's the if you're open to it, then I would like to get access to more. Uh, data room around your like map right away.
yeah. So I think that's the if you're open to it, then I would like to get access to more. Uh, data room around your like map right away.

S Speaker 356:06like such that you just, you know, the top the same thing, because over there, then there's everybody, and we don't have as much time for a discussion, we just say, Okay, here's where open audio fish Audio is. Here's the plan for the future. Here why we are different from everybody else. And here's our revenue so far, and here's our plan for world domination.

I like that you have a plan for world domination
S Speaker 356:39so and then the other thing is, you're based in Berkeley, right? Oh, no, I mean SF. Oh, you're an SF. So, no, actually, we should meet in person.
so and then the other thing is, you're based in Berkeley, right? Oh, no, I mean SF. Oh, you're an SF. So, no, actually, we should meet in person.
so and then the other thing is, you're based in Berkeley, right? Oh, no, I mean SF. Oh, you're an SF. So, no, actually, we should meet in person.

57:04next week. Maybe,
57:07yeah, yeah, we can meet next week. Definitely
yeah, yeah, we can meet next week. Definitely
yeah, yeah, we can meet next week. Definitely
yeah, yeah, we can meet next week. Definitely
S Speaker 357:10the issue next week. I mean, 10 year old, so,
the issue next week. I mean, 10 year old, so,
the issue next week. I mean, 10 year old, so,
the issue next week. I mean, 10 year old, so,
S Speaker 257:14okay, the issue for from our side is actually, so the case is we do have enough money in our bank account, and our runway is longer than one year for now, and we are actually spending money. And as you know, we are going to release the new stuff in around one month, and we plan to begin raising the next round after the release. So that means, if you know the lower valuation now, and finally, the close date, and maybe just one week before our final launch distance maybe doesn't make a lot of sense to us. So maybe we can see if we can first establishing some kind of partnership into speech and then in the next one, and see if we can work together.
okay, the issue for from our side is actually, so the case is we do have enough money in our bank account, and our runway is longer than one year for now, and we are actually spending money.

S Speaker 358:19We can do that too. Shijit, I'll tell you this, like in this space for us to come in the next round is typically harder,
We can do that too. Shijit, I'll tell you this, like in this space for us to come in the next round is typically harder,
We can do that too. Shijit, I'll tell you this, like in this space for us to come in the next round is typically harder,
We can do that too. Shijit, I'll tell you this, like in this space for us to come in the next round is typically harder,
S Speaker 358:35the risk reward, what I've seen is like we either come in at a really late stage. Then when we, you know, you're a five, ten billion company, right? Like, like that, yeah. Or we try to come in early, and then we price it, come in early, and then at this price, right?
the risk reward, what I've seen is like we either come in at a really late stage. Then when we, you know, you're a five, ten billion company, right? Like, like that, yeah. Or we try to come in early, and then we price it, come in early, and then at this price, right?

S Speaker 359:00I mean, that's the, that's, that's exactly why I wanted to have, like, this open discussion now and then I gave you the timeline. That's the timeline. Why don't you think about it? Right?
I mean, that's the, that's, that's exactly why I wanted to have, like, this open discussion now and then I gave you the timeline. That's the timeline. Why don't you think about it? Right?

In the meantime, I will also discuss with our team.
In the meantime, I will also discuss with our team.
S Speaker 359:17Our process is like, this is like, close the like firing and everything is what I'm saying, three weeks, but, but everything else, like, like, in terms of, you know, verbal sign off and then, like an IC, we can do it rather faster, right? Like, so three weeks is pretty fast already for us, and I understand where you're coming from, but,
Our process is like, this is like, close the like firing and everything is what I'm saying, three weeks, but, but everything else, like, like, in terms of, you know, verbal sign off and then, like an IC, we can do it rather faster, right?
