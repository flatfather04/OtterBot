S Speaker 10:03I about a year now, so I I'll give you a background about myself. Think that's a good segue. I graduated from IIT Madras in 2018 and then I was working with clean Max, which is an Indian based B to B renewable energy company, sort of saw the company grow from series A to they're about to file an IPO. So that's been interesting. Then moved to the US for my MBA. Did an MBA from UCLA. Was with venture over the two years I was doing my MBA. So all with Menlo Ventures, Morpheus, as a few funds, and now with Qualcomm, focusing on AI investments, mostly in the agentically, for about a year now, close to a year. How big is your team in so SF, we are six people, and then three in San Diego, yeah. So, yes, yes, we have a couple of members in India. It's a global fund. So we have two members in India, small mandate there, I would say, about 15, $20 million a year. And then in us, we aim to deploy about 150 a year. So we invest out of the balance sheet of Qualcomm and majorly invest in AI. Given Qualcomm is a silicon player downstream. Makes a lot of sense. We have had investments in AI Foundation, model layers and anthropic hugging, face tooling layer in weights and biases, scale AI company called well said labs and voice AI and then now, I think the focus for this year would be making more investments in the application layer. So in application we have mostly invested in computer vision companies so far, but now going into more generative AI agentic companies, yeah.

S Speaker 11:57Personally, yes. So I also lead our team's electrification and clean tech focus, given have an interest in background in that. But for Qualcomm, it's not that big an area for, I would say AI investments and Agent tech areas applied AI would be 70, 80% of my time, and then another 15, 20% in clean

S Speaker 12:45that you have aI infra, not as much. So we are currently looking at a few framework companies, and I think proc is in the same layer. So we'd love to chat about that, but we are starting to look at crew. AI has a very big developer ecosystem in the Bay Area for sure. So we are starting to look at crew area, crew AI. There's a company called Task aid in similar workflow automation space. We're looking at that. And there's a company, very pre seed tool house AI. So we're taking a look at some of these framework companies and seeing if we can make a bet there. And then at the same time, we are also quite bullish about vertical AI agents. We think there, there have been multiple big outcomes in that space already, so we want to make sure that we have few bets in there as well. Got

S Speaker 13:38us? Absolutely. Man. Also I went to the website, and I think I have a sense. While researching, I also came across a couple of your YouTube videos. So I do have a sense. Maybe what would be great to know is you have a framework, how end to end. Is that framework and what are the work? I would say workflows that people are automating right now from that framework, how is your go to, go to motion, what? How do you price the entire thing? Maybe an overview around that? Yes,
us? Absolutely. Man. Also I went to the website, and I think I have a sense. While researching, I also came across a couple of your YouTube videos. So I do have a sense.

S Speaker 25:05the, so, basically, largely, what we're trying to do is, what we're building is agentic, commerce, workforce, infrastructure, and mother, I mean, is that basically, and this is the, you know, some ways you know about it, and AI things have not, you know, this part of enterprises, and that's basically, is also, everyone is envisioning that a lot of you know, agents will be part of enterprise work through automation stuff. And any of these agentic enterprises will need some kind of digital infrastructure to create, deploy, monitor, and when I say create, basically manufacture custom agents, because a lot of these odd workflow automation, the workflows are very, very custom, take from this data source and then do something, and then put it and do This kind of task and stuff and so they are standard, you know, researcher or, you know, those kind of stuff, do

research, basically, for example, you know, you know,
research, basically, for example, you know, you know,
S Speaker 26:15something like that, one of our use cases that you know, ours, you know, e commerce, use some of the sellers visible on a particular website, you know. And then, you know, how do you make sure that why they're not

S Speaker 26:34some products are out of stock. Why they are out of stock? You know, they are stock. What to do? These are very custom flows

S Speaker 26:55And this is where you know we are different from other frameworks that you might come across, that we have collaborative fabric in this employment, which is that agents can talk to each other, communicate with each other, discover, you know, announce their communities. They can be discovered or now constructed in a way that it is seamless in nature. So that's that's one where, you know, we have differentiation, where we created this protocol called ATTP protocol, which is the agent text transfer protocol. So it's modeled around HTTP, but we believe that agents will communicate, not through some kind of discovered schemas of the APIs, but they will be standardized query endpoints where I can query the other agent in natural language stuff and then cut the data like, for example, what is the refund for this time? So I don't need to do API.

S Speaker 27:55Third is basically monitoring part. Actually I should be able to monitor because I have 1000s of agents in my, you know, my organization, how do I see what the agent is doing? What is it down? Is it up? You know, what is the performance? How many tasks it has done? How many tasks are not completed, those kinds of things. So, this is, this is a exhaustive, you know, you can say that deployment creation, deployment monitoring framework that we are building, I believe there's nothing like it. Personally, I've seen through AI to land grabs of the world, autogen, so on this kind of stuff. Nothing like this exist and we are building it. And that's basically the

Personally, I've seen through AI to land grabs of the world, autogen, so on this kind of stuff. Nothing like this exist and we are building it. And that's basically the
S Speaker 18:47opportunity that you see. And Manoj, just a sorry, quick question there you. You see the differentiation from the fact that you are fine tuning some of your individual agents based on E commerce workflows. Or is there any other differentiation that you see? Yeah.
opportunity that you see. And Manoj, just a sorry, quick question there you. You see the differentiation from the fact that you are fine tuning some of your individual agents based on E commerce workflows. Or is there any other differentiation that you see? Yeah.

opportunity that you see. And Manoj, just a sorry, quick question there you. You see the differentiation from the fact that you are fine tuning some of your individual agents based on E commerce workflows. Or is there any other differentiation that you see? Yeah.
S Speaker 29:05So basically, that is one thing that we are vertically from that perspective, we are vertically focused right now. Yeah, e commerce is the one, and we have built some kind of pre built library of agents, also, given that we know this industry well. So we started with three, four, actually, right now, very strong use cases where, you know, we have created a search engine which is a multilingual, you know, voice search agent in search, semantically, you know, catalog and stuff. Second thing is catalog, which basically can create catalog from any data source and then create catalog very, very quickly. So that kind of catalog may be in a mail or cataloging anywhere quickly. And the third basically is customer support, and that's a simpler agent, which I will everyone needs kind of and about fourth is analytics, the four use cases, simple use cases, generic use cases, that we have seen in all econ sublise. And therefore there's a pre built library that we also building, but, but I don't want to, I don't want to say that we are a pre built library kind of way that's the only differentiation that we have. Of course, the experience comes and then we are putting lot of experience, but we have in E commerce, in those agents, but to the framework that we have defined the way that build agents, we have a grok agent, for example, a base agent which has, sorry, multiple capabilities already in built in that agent, like summarization and simple things like that and those kind of stuff. On top of that, you can actually build lot of custom, you know, capabilities in that agent. So you can take the block agent and build on top of it very, very quickly. And that's basically is something that we worked on for last 12 months to build this kind of framework. So these are highlighting customers, because unless you provide that capability in a simple way, workflow automation in this of these advisers will be difficult. So the two switches, if you look at probably the two agentic switches which is happening. One is the agents are sort of replacing human. So there is a agent to human, the human to agent switch, right? Basically, where I'm going to, let's say coding like, so I'm sort of replacing a sub drop developer, right? So that's basically the coding agent is sort of placing a coding agent. So that's one switch is happening, another one which the app is becoming agent tech, so app itself is no longer standard. App where you are, you know, doing some kind of typing and interaction with App is also changing so you can score conversation in nature is more dynamic in nature, is not related in its work, you know, application type stuff, so you can do lot more with their app that stuff, right? So that's basically the example. For example. You know how search used to work. Now how different search is today that we are launching, that you can actually talk to them
So basically, that is one thing that we are vertically from that perspective, we are vertically focused right now. Yeah, e commerce is the one, and we have built some kind of pre built library of agents, also, given that we know this industry well. So we started with three, four, actually, right now, very strong use cases where, you know, we have created a search engine which is a multilingual, you know, voice search agent in search, semantically, you know, catalog and stuff. Second thing is catalog, which basically can create catalog from any data source and then create catalog very, very quickly. So that kind of catalog may be in a mail or cataloging anywhere quickly. And the third basically is customer support, and that's a simpler agent, which I will everyone needs kind of and about fourth is analytics, the four use cases, simple use cases, generic use cases, that we have seen in all econ sublise. And therefore there's a pre built library that we also building, but, but I don't want to, I don't want to say that we are a pre built library kind of way that's the only differentiation that we have. Of course, the experience comes and then we are putting lot of experience, but we have in E commerce, in those agents, but to the framework that we have defined the way that build agents, we have a grok agent, for example, a base agent which has, sorry, multiple capabilities already in built in that agent, like summarization and simple things like that and those kind of stuff. On top of that, you can actually build lot of custom, you know, capabilities in that agent. So you can take the block agent and build on top of it very, very quickly. And that's basically is something that we worked on for last 12 months to build this kind of framework. So these are highlighting customers, because unless you provide that capability in a simple way, workflow automation in this of these advisers will be difficult. So the two switches, if you look at probably the two agentic switches which is happening. One is the agents are sort of replacing human. So there is a agent to human, the human to agent switch, right? Basically, where I'm going to, let's say coding like, so I'm sort of replacing a sub drop developer, right? So that's basically the coding agent is sort of placing a coding agent. So that's one switch is happening, another one which the app is becoming agent tech, so app itself is no longer standard. App where you are, you know, doing some kind of typing and interaction with App is also changing so you can score conversation in nature is more dynamic in nature, is not related in its work, you know, application type stuff, so you can do lot more with their app that stuff, right? So that's basically the example. For example. You know how search used to work. Now how different search is today that we are launching, that you can actually talk to them
So basically, that is one thing that we are vertically from that perspective, we are vertically focused right now. Yeah, e commerce is the one, and we have built some kind of pre built library of agents, also, given that we know this industry well. So we started with three, four, actually, right now, very strong use cases where, you know, we have created a search engine which is a multilingual, you know, voice search agent in search, semantically, you know, catalog and stuff.

S Speaker 212:48I'm not choosing filters. I'm not in the house. I'm not typing speaking, and my filters are already in the in my query, so I don't have to apply those classes. So basically, I just want to highlight that these so, so when you look at the you know the these, this enterprise will come agent, take the slip becoming agent, taking these two directions. One is apps are conveniently. One is absolutely agents are a basic human side the so basically, lot of these things require customization, and that's basically, is where a framework is very interesting we are. We actually also published a research paper on novel architecture of agent network. So, so whatever we form, collaborate, collaborative workforce is a network architecture of network agents coming together and
I'm not choosing filters. I'm not in the house. I'm not typing speaking, and my filters are already in the in my query, so I don't have to apply those classes.

So the research paper. Also, we published this.
S Speaker 214:06So, yeah, so basically, that's, that's broadly what we are doing, but fundamentally, you know, that's basically what what we are telling enterprises, that you can build highly product traditional workforces. It will give productivity is a classic agent tick, you know, value proposition that you get a productivity boost your customer experience enhances, you know, cost optimization, because you might be, you know, getting a lot of HR cost kind of securities. Security is one thing, because we are talking to enterprises, is something that we have baked in grounds up. So, you know, you can, for example, create agent private clouds where agents are just talking to each other in that private cloud, but they're not talking to others. That's why having great accounts private cloud, and marketing private cloud, the only, only way you know marketing can talk to accounts is through some kind of gateway agent.
So, yeah, so basically, that's, that's broadly what we are doing, but fundamentally, you know, that's basically what what we are telling enterprises, that you can build highly product traditional workforces. It will give productivity is a classic agent tick, you know, value proposition that you get a productivity boost your customer experience enhances, you know, cost optimization, because you might be, you know, getting a lot of HR cost kind of securities.

15:12So that's, that's
S Speaker 215:15every all the communications, encrypted, authenticated. That's, that's completely baked in account access controls what an agent can do an agent cannot do custom workflow. That's basically what I meant. That custom agents is something that we we are sort of, you know, saying that we are very, very good at that. Now with custom agents also comes to a service there. Now this is where our strength in India, where, you know, you can provide services. So if someone is to someone says that I have a swab of FDI agents that have employed, I want to be monitored, you know, and then
every all the communications, encrypted, authenticated. That's, that's completely baked in account access controls what an agent can do an agent cannot do custom workflow. That's basically what I meant. That custom agents is something that we we are sort of, you know, saying that we are very, very good at that. Now with custom agents also comes to a service there.

So if someone is to someone says that I have a swab of FDI agents that have employed, I want to be monitored, you know, and then
15:55you have to manage those. So that service, there
you have to manage those. So that service, there
you have to manage those. So that service, there
you have to manage those. So that service, there
S Speaker 215:59is also something that Palantir kind of stuff. They said that this forward deployed specialist, those kind of stuff, also something that we are also offering, that is something called in India that becomes the strength for us so that that's broadly any questions
is also something that Palantir kind of stuff. They said that this forward deployed specialist, those kind of stuff, also something that we are also offering, that is something called in India that becomes the strength for us so that that's broadly any questions
is also something that Palantir kind of stuff. They said that this forward deployed specialist, those kind of stuff, also something that we are also offering, that is something called in India that becomes the strength for us so that that's broadly any questions
is also something that Palantir kind of stuff. They said that this forward deployed specialist, those kind of stuff, also something that we are also offering, that is something called in India that becomes the strength for us so that that's broadly any questions
S Speaker 116:27that's that's very interesting. Manoj, for sure, I get the value proposition one question I have. And I have this question because I'm comparing some of the aspects with crew. AI, how many of your agents do you see are in production? And let's say you have some big clients like snap D me show are they running any agents on production? And how much of your platform would you say is still for experimentation, like people are trying out agents, but they don't have that in production, or they the usage for some of these agents are not ramping up over time, things like
that's that's very interesting. Manoj, for sure, I get the value proposition one question I have. And I have this question because I'm comparing some of the aspects with crew.

S Speaker 217:02that, still early. So Priyesh, that's the, that's the Frank also said that we are still very early. Yeah, agents are still not in full production kind of stuff. And, you know, we will feel that, we feel that in this quarter we will have lot more this. Lot of these agents will be out in the production, you know, enterprise at least, where the, you know, some part of their workflow may not be very intrusive workflows, but maybe non intrusive workflows will have some of these agents where they will try so, but basically, the that's, That's, that's where we are today, you know, from a traction perspective, which we did spend a lot of time building this, and that reflects in the production. So it's not a, it is not an something. It's where we are early in product. So product took itself, but we are, we are late. Traction, that's, that's definitely the
that, still early. So Priyesh, that's the, that's the Frank also said that we are still very early. Yeah, agents are still not in full production kind of stuff.

So it's not a, it is not an something. It's where we are early in product. So product took itself, but we are, we are late. Traction, that's, that's definitely the
S Speaker 118:07case, absolutely. Manoj, and that's, that's very fair, because even crew AI, which probably has the biggest developer ecosystem in terms of agentic framework, what we see is most of their agents are still in experimentation stage, and there aren't a lot of agents already in production. So that's very fair. I totally understand that. How are you planning to price this, and what would your business model be
case, absolutely. Manoj, and that's, that's very fair, because even crew AI, which probably has the biggest developer ecosystem in terms of agentic framework, what we see is most of their agents are still in experimentation stage, and there aren't a lot of agents already in production.

S Speaker 218:33risky? Pricing is, as everyone is doing, is task based protocol that we have built, we have a task ID, which is baked in. So if agent one gets a task so a task ID is assigned by the agent one, then if there is a hand over the task to agent two, Agent three, that task ID is same, right? Whoever gives the task also gives a task value. For example, it may be order creation task. Example, I'm just giving e commerce example, the Order, order is 100 value, right? So if order gets created successfully, then the value of the task is 100, $100 and we basically are charging on like, you know, if it, if it is a transaction flow, then we charging point to 5% so, so that, basically, so interestingly, you know, we begin on DC, you know, pandemic, additional farmers in India. And you know, of course, the orders, the millions of orders getting created there. What we're doing is, you know, we are sort of giving, making a platform itself, that platform, agent, ticket nature. So everything which is happening in the ERP, you know, we are just making them as 1000s of agents, because it gives, sort of, you know, sort of sort of for us to think that if tomorrow, if I go to an enterprise and tell them that this is how your you know, agents will look like, You know, I can present case study also as a case study that here is something that we were working, you know, 1000s of agents.
risky? Pricing is, as everyone is doing, is task based protocol that we have built, we have a task ID, which is baked in.

20:31A lot of my current tasks,

20:34which I see today, I have already converted into
which I see today, I have already converted into
which I see today, I have already converted into
which I see today, I have already converted into
S Speaker 220:38AI saved myself lot of, lot of hours, right? So that's, that's something we have already started as exercise, that stuff. So there also, basically the task is order creation. So whatever the order was getting. Now we are converting that into task that is not a task application we already charge and we make about, you know, we have a, you know, annual rate of about 250, to 300k right now of that, so that basically is, we'll be baked in. There also transaction based fee, because there also we provide infrastructure. Here also is transaction fee based. Everything is task free. You know, if you order task values, $100 we take point five to point 5% right now, if this, if you're, if you are doing a human to innovate, human to agents which, like some something, where the agent is just, just replacing any human, it can be 20 to 25% of that human value, that stuff, whatever that is.
AI saved myself lot of, lot of hours, right? So that's, that's something we have already started as exercise, that stuff. So there also, basically the task is order creation.
