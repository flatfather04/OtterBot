S Speaker 10:00Phosphate or graphite, cool lamps. Energy Solutions offers a different way to solve this problem. We our electrochemical technology enables us to be located in small trailers that can be distributed across the country and customized to meet our customers needs. So we use a chemical process that is inexpensive and aqueous based to extract valuable materials from batteries. So this could be both graphite and cathode active materials that includes nickelamine, use cobalt and lithium iron phosphate. All of that, combined with the copper that we can also extract represents 85% of the total value, in case, within a battery. So this process is very efficient. We're looking to scale right now. So we're asking for a million dollars in pre seed funding to go from our lab scale extraction units, which can harvest 10 batteries at a time, we want to go up to 100 batteries at a time. This will allow us to produce more material faster and allow us to explore more opportunities with more customers. Come talk to me for more information about that. Thank you. Applause.

S Speaker 11:26Hello everybody. My name is Leopold, co founder at Mexico. As we are using more and more RDG, as we are building more the use of fossil fuel is growing in 2014 we're going to use 50% more natural gas in the US. At the same time, new regulations are created to reach a goal of net zero. Nitiko is offering a unique point source cabin capital solution to decarbonize existing processes. It is unique because it is 60% lower capex than the competition. It is a simple plug and play system that does not require any upstream adjustments. Finally, you can have it next, next to your house in your neighborhood. It is completely safe for the people in the environment. We make it possible thanks to this, our material usually developed at Caltech. It is a mix of basic chemicals together, very efficient at absorbing the purifying CO two at low temperature. Industrial are eager to be pumped out of neutral and with our system, save our generic money, we offer them the opportunity to own their CO three emissions. They can sell it. They can reuse it, or work with partners on sequestration, turning this waste into a revenue. Who are our customers, any industrial process with less than 20% between their females? Finally, to demonstrate those benefits, we risk support from the natural gas Innovation Fund to build and operate the system in Canada next year, we want to act now and accelerate global decolonization. We are currently closing our children. So come talk to me if you like more

S Speaker 13:14information. Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. My name is Hong I am the CEO of Kenny magnet energy. Our mission is to build the most powerful magnet and achieve the mass production for the energy industry and net zero. So the American security highly dependent on the energy and its sources of the ability. There are two challenges graffiti right now. So one is like European energy shortage, about four terawatts by 2050 it's even more challenging to achieve net zero by 2050 Fortunately, with high confidence, is available right now, so you can unlock the fusion energy to produce unlimited energy for the future. And by the way, you can also produce this clean solution in energy storage, transmission and other industries. But building nation magnet is not easy, because there is no interstellarization gap, and it can be labor intensive, intensive, and also it has complexity system. So we are trying to tackle these difficulties to achieve the water production. So CME is the only patient bank for this company to work out this task. So we worked out our product process trying to achieve water production at low cost. We started design, and then we and then we think about the white coil, and then to sample the magnet and proceed from the picture. So eventually we'll produce a solution for our customers. We got very close support from our collections like National Laboratory vocabulary probing lab, and also like Indian universities, and we have 14 companies in the pipeline who are working pretty hard. So we are in 19. We are made of professional from National Lab myself at a PhD on Asian magnet. We also have Professor Steven Stauber

S Speaker 15:57methane is a huge problem, but over the recently of actual measurements been made, and they indicate the problem is much worse than previously thought. This is left emitters scrambling to find technologies in the final fixed weeks before third parties here. The issue is that today's technologies are inadequate. For instance, satellites only provide a snapshot in time among optical technologies. Telesense is unique in that we can quantify leaks at very complex assets like landfills, and we can do it at a much lower cost than those other technologies. As you can see, some of our sensors use the sun as a spectroscopic light source. The sun for both the line of sight of the sensor through the sky over the course of the day, and thus, these sensors act very much like an echo radar. We've also developed the capability of monitoring 24/7, over fixed paths, and those sensors are particularly useful for leak prone assets, like compressor stations. These sensors exist. We're deploying them now at multiple paid pilots. These paid pilots represent the gamut of applications of our technology, all the way from oil and gas to cattle agriculture, which brings me my final point, which is that we're raising the $2 million seed round to fund additional pilots and expand their market activities. Thank

S Speaker 17:41you. Hello. My name is Mike from qetic. We are tackling climate change with a radically better energy storage technology. Now picture an energy storage system added to the substation of every district of every town of every city. That is a massive undertaking, but it's also a trillion dollar plus opportunity. We do have lithium and sodium batteries. They are gradually improving, but their fundamental weaknesses remain, degradation and low cycle life. In fact, battery OMS typically limit for one cycle a day, and that is a problem because battery operators make money by cycling. Now kinetic solves these problems by eliminating electrochemicals entirely. Instead, we saw a vast amount of energy mechanically in the form of kinetic energy. Kinetic is half the cost of today's 50 mile systems, but kinetics superpower is that it can handle unlimited daily cycling with zero degradation. It's the infinite battery. This multi cycling capability multiplies revenue operators, and that's what gets customers excited. We already have Lois worth $100 million including Tesla's largest megapack customer, Aramark energy. We flowed through painting to build a moment around our bearing of rota innovations, and we built our prototype demonstrating all our core technologies and our unique design approach. We're now raising our $6 million seed rounds to deliver our serial product to our first US grid customers that will bring us to revenue and the start of production. So welcome you to say hello at the kinetic standard explore and we can talk about funding the kinetic energy revolution. Thank you.

S Speaker 19:48Hormones. They regulate almost everything in your body, like even before you were born, to hide for right now, the way you die, they're crucial and volleyball and today, if you wanted to mentor them, you have to physically go to a lab for somebody to take your blood job. That's super invasive, and only a single data point for IDF. You have to do that every two days for weeks. It's so demanding for patients that they have to go part time or sometimes quit their jobs. And it's insane, honestly, that we've been doing this the same way we did 75 years ago, until now, now I can wear a DNA based sensor that tracks my hormones wherever I am. My name is Ula, and I had a wearable device between app 16 and led multiple enterprises at Palantir. My co founder, IB worked on many, difficult, many medical devices at Philips and invented electrochemical sensors before our scientists have combined 20 plus years experience in nanotechnology and DNA based sensing. Hormone monitoring is futurist for fertility, personalized medicine or wellness. Now is a perfect time. Consumer awareness about hormones is increasing rapidly. CGMS have made devices that are normalized. And lastly, this technology has only been possible the last 18 months. We're the earliest company here. We've been around for only nine months, but let me give you a taste in how much we've been able to do in that time, starting with hormone critical markets, we already have loi for 1.5 million in our pipeline from some of the leading clinics that can convert to amp and ARR up to date, we have built an incredible clinical advisory board from Harvard, CCRS, monsante and hems. Most importantly, after 1000s of experiments, we have shown that our sensor works in various concentrations for all the airlines that we need. If there's one thing I would like you to take away is this, we're starting with a massive market, but that's only the beginning. We're making hormones as readily available as your step count or heart rate. The company to win this market starts now.

That's super invasive, and only a single data point for IDF. You have to do that every two days for weeks. It's so demanding for patients that they have to go part time or sometimes quit their jobs. And it's insane, honestly, that we've been doing this the same way we did 75 years ago, until now, now I can wear a DNA based sensor that tracks my hormones wherever I am. My name is Ula, and I had a wearable device between app 16 and led multiple enterprises at Palantir. My co founder, IB worked on many, difficult, many medical devices at Philips and invented electrochemical sensors before our scientists have combined 20 plus years experience in nanotechnology and DNA based sensing. Hormone monitoring is futurist for fertility, personalized medicine or wellness. Now is a perfect time. Consumer awareness about hormones is increasing rapidly. CGMS have made devices that are normalized. And lastly, this technology has only been possible the last 18 months. We're the earliest company here. We've been around for only nine months, but let me give you a taste in how much we've been able to do in that time, starting with hormone critical markets, we already have loi for 1.5 million in our pipeline from some of the leading clinics that can convert to amp and ARR up to date, we have built an incredible clinical advisory board from Harvard, CCRS, monsante and hems. Most importantly, after 1000s of experiments, we have shown that our sensor works in various concentrations for all the airlines that we need. If there's one thing I would like you to take away is this, we're starting with a massive market, but that's only the beginning. We're making hormones as readily available as your step count or heart rate. The company to win this market starts now.
S Speaker 112:11Hi, I'm Timmons, CEO of deepspin. At deepspin, we revolutionized MRI through the power of AI. Conventional MRI systems have four major problems. They require complex information. They are very difficult to operate. They are very costly in terms of up front and running cost, and they have full patient experience. And they don't give patient access during imaging. At geeks, we solved all of these problems. We've created the world's first high performance project with heat scanner, the scanner that is mobile and usable, any usable anywhere. It is easy to operate. It has more than an order of magnitude manufacturing cost reduction, and it is fully open for this technology. There are three exciting opportunities. The first one is preventative health care, so early infection of cancer, where our lowest cost distant per scan, is really crucial. Secondly, universal MRI access, so allowing to do MRI scans where you can't even do conventional technology. And another exciting one, interventional MRI, so using the scanner to guide procedures like biopsy, insulation and so on. And in all of these areas, we have a unique right to win. For example, in the last one, it's only possible because our scanners completely open, and we have the team and the partners to make this a reality. In fact, we've got a working prototype in our lab in Berlin, and we are now gearing up for 12 million series A to facilitate clinical deployments, reach FDA insurance and

S Speaker 113:57initial commercialization. It just sounds exciting to you. Thank you. Hello. My name is Razani. I'm CEO of Delaware evening. Guided biopsy needed for any detection of lung cancer. 60% of the patient have here they will miss the first biopsy, and when they come for the second biopsy, it often relates for any intervention, because this problem biopsy, basically when they find the nodule is in the proper scope, proper scope of a working channel, they send an ultrasound to localize the nodule. When they localize the nodule, ultrasound actually by the entire working channel, they need to take it out make room for needle. This exchange between devices reduce 44% error in biopsy, and that's where 38% of all cancer related medical malpractice was due to the lung cancer misdiagnosis. And with optics, we are leveraging a cutting at optical technology called metal surfaces. Metal surfaces to optics are very similar to electronics, transistor to electronics. The same way that transistor shrink vacuum tube and give us our pocket computers. Metal surfaces can shrink optics to the ultra team of that surface that enable integration of the optics and needed a single device which is three times smaller than existing solution, which is we can get to the any place in the long with our device, we are raising ten million for series A to launch the product in us, and 3000 disposable device. We are 510 k to last two. We don't need any human data for our 510 k application. That happens soon, but we did run a pilot study for market adoption. We think we have the best imaging hardware in the market. We have a demo tested for yourself, and we believe we have the best thing to commercialize this project. Thank you. Hi, I'm Natalie. I'm your friend, where I'm walking your full potential with the web. Wearable device that both treats and tracks ADHD. One of the biggest issues in way we treat mental health today is a lack of objectivity in the way we diagnose it, which means we can't and track patient outcomes, and that's a big issue. So we're solving this one health at a time, starting with ADHD. Does anyone here have ADHD? Or know someone who does? All right, yeah, no, it's okay. It's one in 20 people who have ADHD, but the house of 80% of them are dissatisfied diseases. This results in a massive loss productivity in what place, as well as adding healthcare costs. We built the wearable device that's going to treats and tracks ADHD in just 20 minutes data. So we do that combining body based brain stimulation as well as optical imaging that allows us to improve focus, memory and impulsivity. We also made a quotation to track the data so they can see how they're progressing over time. Combining our variable with our software, we've enabled real world terms brain aging as well as next gen driven so our journey today started with technical innovation, where we were able to take big and expensive spraying device and 100 costume sized music. From there, we come to innovation and build a proprietary data set where we can diagnose ad as well to track symptoms vary within 80% of one score, and from there, running 100,000 clinical trials so it doesn't live in super controlled with very exciting results that we're expecting, looking forward to publishing soon. And now we've just launched our private data so users can try our device and purchase it, and our first cohort sold out in under four days. And if you'd like to try our device and see your brain activity, come chat

S Speaker 118:00to me. Up to this. Hello, we're in DC. We're a medical probiotics company, and we're creating a new chapter in minimally invasive surgery. Cancer impacts everyone, whether directly with your family and friends, and biopsy is one of the first steps in the diagnostic process. What we're specifically focused on are the 3 million percutaneous soft tissue biopsies done each year in the US, these are done with the long needle functioning through the skin, targeting organs like the kidney, the liver, the prostate and breast, and you're trying to get a small lesion deep under the skin, so it's really difficult. There's a lot of missed targets. There's diagnostic error in about a quarter of these cases. The Waste done today is shown in this animation, you insert the needle part way, and then you put the patient back in the scanner to re image, make sure you go on track. Then you pull them back out, insert another splendid or back in reimage, make sure everything is on track, and then pull them back out. It's called the stepwise biopsy. You move the patient in and out many times, as you can imagine, long procedures and many missed targets, high level MRI guide. Biopsies are difficult and slow, and we're making them simple and efficient. We've created a robotic device that provides physicians remote access from the control room directly into the scanner using an MRI state hydraulic transmission, the surrender of our system. We have an input Console, hydraulic transmission, loop structure and output mechanism. We built a bunch of prototypes to show off this technology. This is a six axis arm. Is fully plastic, ceramic. All the actuation is with hydraulics. Here you can see, actually today, in the back is a specific mechanism for liver biopsy. It's a five axis device, x, y2, angles and yellow. And we've got a great team where it's been out from Stanford. We have engineers, physicians and industry experts looking forward to talking to you more.

S Speaker 119:55Hi everyone. My name is Anne. I'm a neuroscientist, and I'm excited to tell you about the way that we're disrupting a $3.5 trillion industry. So let's talk about periods. Most of you probably know what it is and top the world's population. Guess one. But what most of you will not know is that four out of five symptoms that impact women the most around periods are actually mental rather than physical symptoms, symptoms like low mood, anxiety, irritability, difficulty making decisions. In fact, it impacts women so much so that 82% of them say it impacts their productivity every single month. And the reason you're hearing about this for the first time, if you're a woman, you've probably spoken about it with your friends, but not with your employer or oftentimes not even your male partner. So we knew that the solution had to be built in the brain, because that's where the pain and the mood symptoms connect, and so we built that solution. We built dental which is the world's only clinically validated neurophynology device on the market for PMS and menstrual pain, already cleared in Europe. We have grown clinical trials that outperform standard treatments. We have proprietary IP in a space that's already worth $44 billion in the US alone, and growing 14% every single year, and we're the most cost effective option for employers as well as quality of life for women, including payers and healthcare systems. We know that solving a huge pain point for women at this point in a space that has been neglected for so long, earns us the right to be their healthcare partner for life. We built already some of those medical grade technologies, and now we're looking to scale notes in the US with our seed round that we're planning to close this month. We came from world leading neurotechnology institutions and studied our market very deeply in order to hit the same point that so much many people in the world have ignored for way too long. So come talk to us to learn more.

We came from world leading neurotechnology institutions and studied our market very deeply in order to hit the same point that so much many people in the world have ignored for way too long. So come talk to us to learn more.
Hi everyone. My name is Anne. I'm a neuroscientist, and I'm excited to tell you about the way that we're disrupting a $3.5 trillion industry. So let's talk about periods. Most of you probably know what it is and top the world's population. Guess one. But what most of you will not know is that four out of five symptoms that impact women the most around periods are actually mental rather than physical symptoms, symptoms like low mood, anxiety, irritability, difficulty making decisions. In fact, it impacts women so much so that 82% of them say it impacts their productivity every single month. And the reason you're hearing about this for the first time, if you're a woman, you've probably spoken about it with your friends, but not with your employer or oftentimes not even your male partner. So we knew that the solution had to be built in the brain, because that's where the pain and the mood symptoms connect, and so we built that solution. We built dental which is the world's only clinically validated neurophynology device on the market for PMS and menstrual pain, already cleared in Europe. We have grown clinical trials that outperform standard treatments. We have proprietary IP in a space that's already worth $44 billion in the US alone, and growing 14% every single year, and we're the most cost effective option for employers as well as quality of life for women, including payers and healthcare systems. We know that solving a huge pain point for women at this point in a space that has been neglected for so long, earns us the right to be their healthcare partner for life. We built already some of those medical grade technologies, and now we're looking to scale notes in the US with our seed round that we're planning to close this month.

S Speaker 123:51My name is Jose Alto, and I am co founder and CEO of Caddo. At caldo, we develop robotic assistance for commercial kitchens, and we're in dire community. The food industry is at a breaking point. The food industry is at a breaking point. Prices have sorry. Food Industry is at a breaking point. 80% of restaurants in United States are understaffed. Wages have exploded, and prices have done so too. Does anyone know what the big fat combo? Does anyone know that Big Mac combo cost $18 we are witnessing, arguably the most efficient fast food brand in history being forced to raise their prices. Or what happens if you are not McDonald's and can't raise your prices, the business fails. The food service model is broken, and the industry needs to rethink their approach, particularly when it comes to labor. For that reason, we've developed robotic, Modular Robotic kitchen assistants that weigh portion, combine and package ingredients using our proprietary smart scales and ingredient manipulators. Now we've started with portion because it is too decent, time consuming, but it is a key factor that affects and makes or breaks or margins if you over serve in your customer experience, if you underserved. Now, unlike other kitchen automation approaches that take over two years to pay back in capital investment, our task specific approach only takes our customers less than two months. We've seen overwhelming demand from customers ranging from fast casual chains to large corporate campuses, and for that reason, we are starting our secrets to build out our team, to scale up and to deploy the new existing customers. So please join us on the journey to empower people to work better with smarter tools.

S Speaker 125:57Thank you. Hi. I'm Alex, the co founder of ktec, and we're leveling up metal production in the US. Us is reinvestralizing. We all know that, and forging is the gold standard for manufacturing high precision, high performance components, right? And as you can see in this slide, you basically take hot metal, and you hit it with a hammer until you reach the right shape. But it takes a long time and costs a lot of money to deploy. The perfect industry. Example would be the maintenance sector. Now the maintenance sector is a $50 billion industry that is keeping all our planes fine. Their problem. Their problem is they're not finding sourcing spare parts for older plants. That's a problem. It would take them hundreds of millions of dollars and years to deploy new production facilities.

26:55This is where 3d printing should have solved it.
S Speaker 126:59But 3d printing, while it's agile, it doesn't produce the high quality parts that are needed. The parts fail too quickly and unpredictably because of the holes in the gaps in the cracks that you see on this slide right here. Now this is where we come in. Over the last decade, we've developed a technology that takes 's and high pressure sound waves to create metal parts that are 10 to 100 times stronger than regular metal. 3d printers through ultrasonic vibrations and well, more importantly, we can actually get to high complexity, high durability parts, and that is the first, the first time we can, we could do that. So we tested our we've proven our science, and we've tested our components, and we're raising a round to deploy more than what we already have at North and expand our customer base in the US. So we're raising 1.5 billion US dollars to generate up to $3 million in revenue by in two years to improve our customer base, let's bring manufacturing into the 21st century, where the old school fire encounter are replaced with lasers and sound waves.

S Speaker 128:37Thank you. Hi. My name is KP, co founder and CTO of automatic materials, a company is making a new approach to structural impact. Currently, energy industry is facing critical need for a high performance material that can withstand extreme temperature and pressure, as well as more overseas environment. The good news is that atone as a super material development MIT combining metal with Nano ceramics for better mechanical and thermal durability ever before, this will offer essential solution, providing significantly increased strength and harmonies, and most impressive of 100 degree increasing of the temperature. Now the implication of this is enormous. With this improvement, atomic super material can increase efficiency in the existing heat and power industry or 10% and, save 22 million tons of carbon dioxide in United States alone, which equals $500 billion annual fuel saving, while to open the door for future technology like nuclear fusion, which could have even greater impact somewhere our last of team is ready to soar into the market with exciting projects on future, first fusion, first world lightweight, retro and heat exchangers for energy recovery. Atomen is now seeking investors for sitting in your dollar seed round to widen our material shallow and ramp up the production and maximize our impact on energy transformation. Thank you,

It's about enabling more power energy within devices now, and this means putting batteries in place that others can't. What you see here is a platform technology that we pioneered to manufacture a new type of battery that can use any chemistry in any configuration to the making tons of wasted space. Plus, we're addressing two of the biggest issues in the battery supply chain at the moment. One, we're reducing capex on battery manufacturing in a way that's easily scalable and automatable within the US right now. And two, we're incredibly quick because we have the best team we leveraged at manufacturing techniques. We can reduce lead times from years to months to months to weeks. But none of that would matter if we have a forming battery, and we do regardless of chemistry, because we can make batteries conform to any shape. We're unlocking the future of battery capacity by manufacturing on the edge, shortening lean times and consolidating parts. Invest in the future of energy and manufacturing. Invest in us.

S Speaker 132:38My name is Steve Eddington. I'm the CEO of the founders of qfident money, we are solving this problem wiring harnesses. So you find wiring harnesses and everything from dishwashers all the way through supply to aircraft. They are made in these market manual processes, and it's very expensive, great labor intensive, which means they've been chasing the low wages around the world. So supply chains are really long, and with the pandemic and the Ukraine war trade tensions, no supply chains are proven to be incredibly fragile. But also is a manual process, which means it's aircraft and usually some of the reasons why products fail, it's the wiring. So our technology, we got large robotic platforms and software which can automate that process for manufacturers. So either we normally put the wires down onto complex geometries to create light for like component parts for the automotive sector and aerospace sector, or in this case here on a flat path for an EP company whose name cannot be mentioned, but the doing the whole mining artist, and in this particular case, that's what they want to do. You're saving about two to $300 per vehicle. And if you're a manufacturer of drinking several millions, that have a substantial effect on your bottom line. So we reduce costs and obviously improve labor collectivity. And that means you can onshore, you can collapse your supply chain and move your manufacturing resilience enormously. But also, because it's functioning process, your first wiring harness and the 1,000th birthday, wherever wiring harness are all exactly the same. So there's a huge increase improvement quality as well. But also, we take our weight, we take our volume, so you've got that functional improvement.

S Speaker 134:41housing insurance from us once we get from the pipes where we are mount into the manufacturing effect, our machines are assuring expensive which means that each one of those customers will not allow to us. We don't need a lot of customers to get to very large revenues. So we're just kicking off our a series now. So please.

S Speaker 135:09Hello everyone. I am as well, and I'm the CEO and one of the CO commerce of Soviet innovations, and we finally provide a full overview of the construction site happening across the globe. Did you know that 48% of construction rework is just happening because there's poor project data and a lot of miscommunication in the local us? It's costing more than $31 billion annually. But we have a solution for that. We let the construction equipment document the site while the machine is working. You can see our device here. It's just equipped directly on the machine, and it's capturing a digital twin. If, while the machine's working, there is no calibration, no set up time, and still, it delivers a digital twin of the site in real time in our cloud platform, delivering documentation, survey and all the data you need to manage the mega projects to turn up in next year's real time data with no manual network. We are an Austrian company. We started sales in 2022 and had a million in sales over the last year. We have our first OEM contract with more than 100 units in 2026 directly implemented in the construction machine, and only within two months, here in the US, we had our first emails finished. We signed our first unit yesterday, and there are a lot of more emails to come this year. So if you want to join the party and revolutionize how construction sites are managed, just hit me up. I'm the guy with the hat.

S Speaker 136:42to accelerate our sales and consumer of our
S Speaker 136:54new pipeline. Hi, I'm Andy stones. I'm the CEO of Saul Bruce. I worked in robotics, automation for the past 13 years. I come from a big construction family, and the idea for renovate came when I bought my own house that needed a roofer. Place. All the contractors in my area were booked out for two to three months, and then when they finally did show up, they bring a small army of people who are doing this really dangerous, really repetitive work. And it gets me thinking, it's a job that robots should be doing. As I looked into it, that hunt was right, roofing is really a weather driven industry, so climate change, there's more severe and more frequent storms, and that's causing a lot more roof damage and leading to a lot more demand for roofers. At the same time, the job is just terrible. It's hard on you're carrying heavy materials up and down ladders. It's hard on your knees and your bag around the sun, and this is inherent risk of deadly falls, and so all of that culminates in high labor turnover and also just a consistent labor shortage for contractors. But these are all things that we didn't address with robotics. So the way our system works is you mount which anchors around the corners of a roof plane so three across the top and two of the lower corners, and then the robot can pull itself around the roof, use its arm to grab a shingle and place it on the roof and nail it down. This system doubles productivity for contractors, it reduces the time that workers spend at height, and then it also guarantees that the roof was installed right with our machine vision data. We started patenting with roofing contractors in the New Jersey area, and we're raising a seed round this fall to continue deployments and rd so please find me if you'd like to learn more. Thank you. Applause, hi everyone. My name is berada. I am the CEO and co founder of Nimr. Our purpose is to radically improve our buildings. Manage heating and heat pumps are the future of healing and health. Wide refrigerants which are harmful, for instance, expensive to install and monitoring, and meaning we are developing heat pumps using solid state technology. We use semiconductors to generate a thermal gradient rather than a coolant. Our core technology comprises of two parts, a module has been found and a smart control board. It digitally operates our modules, depending on how you package those two elements. Importantly, if we can put them in a variety of different markets, like offices, residential appliances or even data centers. So how we start? We know that the electropogation of existing commercial multifamily is a major problem in every city, property owners are pressured to switch from fossil fuel to electric heat, and they have to do it today and mimic we can solve this problem uniquely. Our technology is even installed at my name is pilot, because there are no moving parts. Is emission free. It's highly compatible with existing solutions, and it's scalable. So far, we've been supported by world class institutions because we are a key task, and we want to move quickly. Over the next 18 months, we are working on executing our first big pilot work on safety or regulatory compliance, and also getting ready for lunch. Industries all around us have moved to solar state and mimic we want to leave and drive this change from heating and
