But yeah, anyways, thank you so much for taking the time to join the call with me today. I'm so glad that I did the coffee chat with you, Bucha, so now you can do a coffee chat with me. So I mean, yeah, before we even start, like, how's your life at Qualcomm, you're still with colcom Ventures, right? Yes, yes. So

S Speaker 11:15I joined them about a year and a few months back. I'm investing in AI technologies right now. So the focus has been on either frontier, AI, foundation model, infrastructure and also vertical applications. So we've invested in anthropic scale, AI, hugging, face, weights and biases. So we feel quite a lot of exposure in the foundation model, actively looking at vertical AI applications that we can invest in. Typically us have a good investment mandate, so we deploy 180 100 $50 million a year in us. So the team is active, for that matter, and I'm enjoying the access to companies I get here. We are slightly later stage. I wish we could do more seed, because that's that's very exciting. But other than that, everything else is going really great,

S Speaker 22:03yeah, I think, like, investing stage companies doesn't really align with Qualcomm's position as a company, right? Like as a corporate VC, like, even for Microsoft, your M 12, right? Yeah, are also relatively later stage. And I think they invest a terrorist in series A companies. And I think it makes sense, because, like, it's a quite a headache to manage a lot of CSA companies. There could be, like, some conflict of interest to yourself. It's probably not even worth the hassle. But anyways, yeah, so I also spent some time in VC after graduation. I can't believe it's been two

2:39years. Yeah, so, like,
years. Yeah, so, like,
years. Yeah, so, like,
years. Yeah, so, like,
S Speaker 22:43I spent about half of the year ish was then after graduation, and then at that point I thought, like, it's very exciting. And actually, the cost of what should I say, starting a business is getting lower every year, you know, like both because of the advancements of infrastructure and flourishment of Software as a Service things. So like right now for us, we use a lot of those by by verse, real solutions, and it's very efficient, don't you need to spend a couple $100 a month to get things out. But essentially, like earlier this year, I met with a friend who was introduced by another friend of mine, arch. He is based in India, and he worked on a very niche e commerce market in India at the time. So it's like an Etsy type of platform compared to Amazon. And he made some decent success. And so we got connected to each other. We're thinking it'd be interesting to build something that is more like context relevant in the consumer facing so at the time, even now, you know, like the larger companies, the foundation model companies like anthropic open AI, new consumer facing products are relatively generic in the sense that they do not retain too much context In the long term, and they do not integrate with external software, right? So, like in the at the time, they didn't even have give you access to pull information across chat sessions, like the memory and context was restrained to a single chat session. Like now, I think last month, they made a memory update now, so you can pull data from across the transactions, and it also allows you to store certain pieces of information that we want to manually store right like, who am I? What I do? Things like that. It's very limited. And I think the reluctance to do a lot of to mess too much with consumer facing data is really because they don't want to keep a clean social perception. They have enough trouble in Washington right now, so they probably don't want to become an to become another Facebook or Google with a lot of the data litigations. And at same time, also don't think like consumer facing, like applications, is really something they're trying to focus on. I think they're putting in a lot of more development effort into, first of all, like foundational research, right their foundational model company, and then it's enterprise integrations. They're putting a lot of work to make sure they can host the models and enterprise their own grandma, because, like, enterprise care a lot about that, right? It was a lot of headache to work with enterprise customers when I was working for IBM. Didn't like that, yeah, but, uh, so they have been very reluctant to work on things like this. So the user experience has been pretty subpar. I'm a huge AI user, and I didn't like to upload the same type of documents over time, because their context window is very limited, and they do not store data server side for the long term. So that was a problematic and the data also didn't integrate with external data. So if I ask like, chatgpt, who's Priyesh, and what is the call with him about, it will tell me I do not have access to that information. You need to tell me more, right? But we could, we could achieve that with integration with, say, LinkedIn, like little now, like, we're connected on LinkedIn, went to the same school, and we had this chat interaction, talking about a coffee chat or virtual chat. So you should be telling me that, and I think that type of context is going to be very important going forward, not just because of a having, like

S Speaker 26:12model, but because I think it will be very important, as we say, as the agent tech workflows dive deeper, because without that context to a model, you can really orchestrate agents that are relevant. It's going to be very generic, right? So that's what we're trying to do right now. We're trying to integrate with external software, I mean external software and data sources. And we're also trying to store data out on our end, so server side. So naturally, we're going after like users who do not care as much about data securities and they care more about the utility of applications. And since you also mentioned vertical AI, so I think vertical AI is a very cool, very quiet, like I think there are a lot of great companies out there, like Kirby, they work on law, right, yeah, and Blackboard, they work on consumer facing accounting. Actually, I haven't heard about them. You know why? I'm not sure how they're doing. They raise a lot of money from their seat around with Andres Horowitz and but there, I think there are a lot of great vertical, AG, companies, and they have, they typically have very good context retention, their relevance, context, relevant responses, right? Uphold was very good workflow. Course, but for vertical AI companies, you know, they typically work in very structured, highly structured industries, so like professional industries, like law, finance, accounting, things like that. But like for less defined workforce, like for us, consumer users or professionals, not for work, but for daily activities, they aren't really suitable. And in the meantime, there are also a lot of creative, horizontal AI solutions. And I think there is essentially a large amount of them are very successful in the go to market tech stack, right conversion play a lot of too many to name, but there are many of them are like getting hundreds of millions in AR with less than 100 employees. Very jealous of them, but, but I think they're also great, and they also have very good context retention, right? Say, for artisan that YC AI sales representative, like, they can retain very good context of your product, your company, like, how you differentiate where standing the market against your competitors and stuff. So the conversation was, potential leads are very relevant and personalized. They're also very good, but we don't want to compete with them because they're too good. And I think the problem was them is that they're a little bit too expensive, and they tend to be unavailable to small businesses that are very, very small. So I'm talking about like, mom and pop shops, or like small businesses with like less than 10 people. And we interviewed a few dozen of the business in that segment, and they typically only have like, a few $100 for software budget a month for all solutions and for horizontal, for horizontal AI, because it's very costly to provide this type of, like, large language model driven solutions, they typically charge people a few $100 for a single solution, right? So artisan charges people at least $199 per month. That's the lowest price point, and that only covers one, one function for a business. So I was thinking maybe we could also do something with like, small businesses that have three that are unstructured in the in less defined industries. So like barber shops, something like, maybe there's, there's even a vertical AI company working on barber shops, but I'm not aware of it, but you get an idea where, yeah, so I was thinking maybe going after those less structured, generic businesses was, like a lower level, basic solution that's cheap, so people could actually adopt a solution, as opposed to, like, choosing using multiple of those expensive vertical, Horizontal solutions. So that is essentially our idea. How we got started, and we're trying to launch our first paid product, probably towards the end of this week or early next week. We're having a slight delay. It's being very annoying to integrate with some of the applications, and Google had issues with our approval for their email integration. It's kind of annoying, but that's essentially where we're coming from, and right now we only have a very basic Open Beta out there. Not very, not very interesting, but it was the new upgrade. We're going to have a UI refresh, and also integrations with people's inbox and email inbox, and also social media accounts like Tiktok, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, things like that. So the model can learn a little bit more about users, but we want to go very fast and integrate more solutions. Like AI is all about user data, and the first player has significant advantage, right? Like, once you get the users, and your model learns about the users and can provide like superior responses the users will have like, less incentive to move out to another product, even if that's like, cheaper or slightly better than yours, they have to be a lot better for people to be like, reintegrate all the source information sources, and refeed all the context. So that's what we're trying to do. And my motivation for this call is really to, like, pick your brain and see, like, what do you like, based on your expertise in the area, what do you think about this idea? Like, who are some of the other competitors? You see are pretty working that are very close to us, what we should be aware of? Things like, like, I think, like, right now, I think there are a lot of companies in the space that we're working on. Each of us are taking a each of us is taking a slightly different approach, right? So say dust, that is the French based, France based, Sequoia series, a company. They're like more on the B to B side, so a little bit different from us. They're a composable, agentic workflow platform, so they allow users to compose their own workflows. And I think they're good, great, but we're trying to do a more, simpler approach, yeah, so we want to compose the basic workflows on our end so the users don't have to do anything. I tried out their product, and it actually took me a couple of hours to make an image integration, which is fine, but I don't think commercial users, or like the average user, would want to have experience with that like for larger companies, of course, no problem at all. And I think that customizability is very valuable, but I don't think we're like in the exactly in the same lane. And there are a lot of other more niche air companies, like a lot of YC companies are working on inbox management, right? Martin or Zuni, I think is one of them. Martin is like an iOS app, and Zuni is like a Chrome extension, like, we're taking different approaches, but I think you're quite a few out there. And I would also learn about, like, your feedback of the idea, and what do you think and stuff. Of course, we're going to test the market, yeah, offset with monetization, but it's always good to, like, learn from others, right?
model, but because I think it will be very important, as we say, as the agent tech workflows dive deeper, because without that context to a model, you can really orchestrate agents that are relevant. It's going to be very generic, right? So that's what we're trying to do right now. We're trying to integrate with external software, I mean external software and data sources.

They raise a lot of money from their seat around with Andres Horowitz and but there, I think there are a lot of great vertical, AG, companies, and they have, they typically have very good context retention, their relevance, context, relevant responses, right? Uphold was very good workflow. Course, but for vertical AI companies, you know, they typically work in very structured, highly structured industries, so like professional industries, like law, finance, accounting, things like that. But like for less defined workforce, like for us, consumer users or professionals, not for work, but for daily activities, they aren't really suitable. And in the meantime, there are also a lot of creative, horizontal AI solutions. And I think there is essentially a large amount of them are very successful in the go to market tech stack, right conversion play a lot of too many to name, but there are many of them are like getting hundreds of millions in AR with less than 100 employees. Very jealous of them, but, but I think they're also great, and they also have very good context retention, right? Say, for artisan that YC AI sales representative, like, they can retain very good context of your product, your company, like, how you differentiate where standing the market against your competitors and stuff. So the conversation was, potential leads are very relevant and personalized. They're also very good, but we don't want to compete with them because they're too good. And I think the problem was them is that they're a little bit too expensive, and they tend to be unavailable to small businesses that are very, very small. So I'm talking about like, mom and pop shops, or like small businesses with like less than 10 people. And we interviewed a few dozen of the business in that segment, and they typically only have like, a few $100 for software budget a month for all solutions and for horizontal, for horizontal AI, because it's very costly to provide this type of, like, large language model driven solutions, they typically charge people a few $100 for a single solution, right? So artisan charges people at least $199 per month. That's the lowest price point, and that only covers one, one function for a business. So I was thinking maybe we could also do something with like, small businesses that have three that are unstructured in the in less defined industries. So like barber shops, something like, maybe there's, there's even a vertical AI company working on barber shops, but I'm not aware of it, but you get an idea where, yeah, so I was thinking maybe going after those less structured, generic businesses was, like a lower level, basic solution that's cheap, so people could actually adopt a solution, as opposed to, like, choosing using multiple of those expensive vertical, Horizontal solutions. So that is essentially our idea. How we got started, and we're trying to launch our first paid product, probably towards the end of this week or early next week. We're having a slight delay. It's being very annoying to integrate with some of the applications, and Google had issues with our approval for their email integration. It's kind of annoying, but that's essentially where we're coming from, and right now we only have a very basic Open Beta out there. Not very, not very interesting, but it was the new upgrade. We're going to have a UI refresh, and also integrations with people's inbox and email inbox, and also social media accounts like Tiktok, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, things like that. So the model can learn a little bit more about users, but we want to go very fast and integrate more solutions. Like AI is all about user data, and the first player has significant advantage, right? Like, once you get the users, and your model learns about the users and can provide like superior responses the users will have like, less incentive to move out to another product, even if that's like, cheaper or slightly better than yours, they have to be a lot better for people to be like, reintegrate all the source information sources, and refeed all the context. So that's what we're trying to do. And my motivation for this call is really to, like, pick your brain and see, like, what do you like, based on your expertise in the area, what do you think about this idea? Like, who are some of the other competitors? You see are pretty working that are very close to us, what we should be aware of? Things like, like, I think, like, right now, I think there are a lot of companies in the space that we're working on. Each of us are taking a each of us is taking a slightly different approach, right? So say dust, that is the French based, France based, Sequoia series, a company. They're like more on the B to B side, so a little bit different from us. They're a composable, agentic workflow platform, so they allow users to compose their own workflows. And I think they're good, great, but we're trying to do a more, simpler approach, yeah, so we want to compose the basic workflows on our end so the users don't have to do anything. I tried out their product, and it actually took me a couple of hours to make an image integration, which is fine, but I don't think commercial users, or like the average user, would want to have experience with that like for larger companies, of course, no problem at all. And I think that customizability is very valuable, but I don't think we're like in the exactly in the same lane. And there are a lot of other more niche air companies, like a lot of YC companies are working on inbox management, right? Martin or Zuni, I think is one of them. Martin is like an iOS app, and Zuni is like a Chrome extension, like, we're taking different approaches, but I think you're quite a few out there. And I would also learn about, like, your feedback of the idea, and what do you think and stuff. Of course, we're going to test the market, yeah, offset with monetization, but it's always good to, like, learn from others, right?
model, but because I think it will be very important, as we say, as the agent tech workflows dive deeper, because without that context to a model, you can really orchestrate agents that are relevant. It's going to be very generic, right? So that's what we're trying to do right now. We're trying to integrate with external software, I mean external software and data sources. And we're also trying to store data out on our end, so server side. So naturally, we're going after like users who do not care as much about data securities and they care more about the utility of applications. And since you also mentioned vertical AI, so I think vertical AI is a very cool, very quiet, like I think there are a lot of great companies out there, like Kirby, they work on law, right, yeah, and Blackboard, they work on consumer facing accounting. Actually, I haven't heard about them. You know why? I'm not sure how they're doing. They raise a lot of money from their seat around with Andres Horowitz and but there, I think there are a lot of great vertical, AG, companies, and they have, they typically have very good context retention, their relevance, context, relevant responses, right? Uphold was very good workflow.

And in the meantime, there are also a lot of creative, horizontal AI solutions. And I think there is essentially a large amount of them are very successful in the go to market tech stack, right conversion play a lot of too many to name, but there are many of them are like getting hundreds of millions in AR with less than 100 employees. Very jealous of them, but, but I think they're also great, and they also have very good context retention, right?

S Speaker 112:57Yeah. So, yeah, very, very, very interesting. And thanks for that comprehensive overview. I have a sense of the entire thing. And very interestingly, I have, I've spoken to a few companies trying to build with a similar, I would say, wedge in the market. So so one of the things I agree with your point, that the next unlock for AI applications, at least in the consumer side, would be on memory and long context understanding. So I think these are the next two unlocks. I have come across a few companies which are working on memory, not from an infrastructure perspective, but working on memory so that down the line, they can go and create a general purpose agent, as I see so. So that's one perspective. I've also come across some companies which are starting from a more emotional first voice, AI driven perspective, and from there they want to expand into, again, integrating with a lot of applications, having long memory, having long term, long context, understanding and create, becoming that one agent which can sit in there. So it's a very, very interesting market, for sure. I definitely see a lot of value in the market. And there will be one bit definite big winner in the space, but it's also competitive, and because there are different companies approaching the same sort of, I would say, space in one's mobile device or a PC device, trying to do the same kind of workflows, integrating with the same data sources, but applying different wedges to enter this market. So that's that's how I see it. To me, somehow, akibono and, like, I'm not sure here, but to me, it seems like the team which will solve it, from like, speaking, from a venture perspective, it seems like a very deeply technical team with some good understanding of UX, because there is, like still some more technical aspects to solve, as in, how do you extend the memory beyond, let's say, just using frameworks, open source frameworks like mem zero, there's a Google based framework, so there are companies like that. How do you go beyond that and really capture a lot of memory, make a lot of long context understanding, and have a good UX to eventually deliver something like this. Yeah.
Yeah. So, yeah, very, very, very interesting. And thanks for that comprehensive overview. I have a sense of the entire thing. And very interestingly, I have, I've spoken to a few companies trying to build with a similar, I would say, wedge in the market.

How do you go beyond that and really capture a lot of memory, make a lot of long context understanding, and have a good UX to eventually deliver something like this. Yeah.
S Speaker 215:27So UX is definitely going to be the key in terms of memory retrieval. I think there's a significant advances in the the open source communities, and I think the technical barrier is typically pretty difficult to what you say, sustain in the AI space, right? If you look at the foundational model companies, they have to burn through 10s of billions of dollars to just maintain a 12 Q, 18 month of lead against open source communities. Of course, we're not even trying to do that. We don't have access to that level of funding or talent. But I think, like a technical barrier is not impossible, but pretty tough to sustain. Like, you can have a technical barrier upfront, but in the long term, I think that's probably hard to sustain. But for the UX part, I think that makes, definitely makes a lot of sense. Because, like, if you look at other consumer facing applications, like Robin Hood, like I was among the first users of Robin Hood when you just got out. It was very bad in terms of product offerings. You could only trade stocks. You could only buy and sell those stocks. You can even short them. You don't have, like, stock lending options. You couldn't trade bonds, you couldn't trade treasuries, you couldn't trade options, you couldn't trade anything. But they had, they had, like, brilliant UI, right? Yeah. And their simplistic UI really captured the young retail investors like me, Bucha underground, like Schwab fidelity, they all sucked, even though they had much, much better product offerings. So like Robin Hood, still curved out a market in like a very What should I say, on a market dominated by legacy players, right? So UX is definitely going to be very important, and especially since for this space, as you say, like even more so than Robin Hood, which is like slightly a market, marketplace ish type of business model, right? But for this type of space, like you really need to capture the first bunch of users and keep them on your platform to make your model actually useful to them and better than other solutions out there. So I think it's definitely a going to be interesting market. I think there will be, but I feel like there will be, like, a couple of, at least a couple of companies out there. I'm not sure, like, if this space was like, 111, player takes all type of business, like, like E commerce platform for Amazon, yeah, or for, like, data centers, for like, AWS and a drawer, right? Yeah. I feel like for this space, there could be quite a few companies out there who might capture a good amount of market. Of course, there might be consolidation down the line with like mnds and stuff, but right now there are, like a few, at least a few 1000, maybe a few 100, probably not as few 1000, but at least a few 100 companies that are working in the space who are trying to capture the users and retain their interactions very often, right? So, along with your lines like emotional intelligence, that's definitely something very interesting. I think character AI there, and was a little bit surprising to me. I thought they would be one of the most valuable companies for in the AI space when they came out in 2022, but, well, I'm not sure if it was a good idea for them to get acquired like at all first, I don't have any information, so they're definitely making a more informed decision than me. But like their their type of approach, or like emotional intelligence, um, anyway, any, just any, any ledge, any edge, to retain the users and capture the instructions, I think is going to be very valuable. So I think that is that makes a lot of sense. But yeah, I think it's a very interesting space, and I think we'll see a lot of things trying to
So UX is definitely going to be the key in terms of memory retrieval. I think there's a significant advances in the the open source communities, and I think the technical barrier is typically pretty difficult to what you say, sustain in the AI space, right? If you look at the foundational model companies, they have to burn through 10s of billions of dollars to just maintain a 12 Q, 18 month of lead against open source communities.

Like, you can have a technical barrier upfront, but in the long term, I think that's probably hard to sustain. But for the UX part, I think that makes, definitely makes a lot of sense. Because, like, if you look at other consumer facing applications, like Robin Hood, like I was among the first users of Robin Hood when you just got out. It was very bad in terms of product offerings. You could only trade stocks. You could only buy and sell those stocks. You can even short them. You don't have, like, stock lending options.

But for this type of space, like you really need to capture the first bunch of users and keep them on your platform to make your model actually useful to them and better than other solutions out there. So I think it's definitely a going to be interesting market. I think there will be, but I feel like there will be, like, a couple of, at least a couple of companies out there. I'm not sure, like, if this space was like, 111, player takes all type of business, like, like E commerce platform for Amazon, yeah, or for, like, data centers, for like, AWS and a drawer, right? Yeah. I feel like for this space, there could be quite a few companies out there who might capture a good amount of market. Of course, there might be consolidation down the line with like mnds and stuff, but right now there are, like a few, at least a few 1000, maybe a few 100, probably not as few 1000, but at least a few 100 companies that are working in the space who are trying to capture the users and retain their interactions very often, right? So, along with your lines like emotional intelligence, that's definitely something very interesting. I think character AI there, and was a little bit surprising to me. I thought they would be one of the most valuable companies for in the AI space when they came out in 2022, but, well, I'm not sure if it was a good idea for them to get acquired like at all first, I don't have any information, so they're definitely making a more informed decision than me. But like their their type of approach, or like emotional intelligence, um, anyway, any, just any, any ledge, any edge, to retain the users and capture the instructions, I think is going to be very valuable. So I think that is that makes a lot of sense. But yeah, I think it's a very interesting space, and I think we'll see a lot of things trying to
So UX is definitely going to be the key in terms of memory retrieval. I think there's a significant advances in the the open source communities, and I think the technical barrier is typically pretty difficult to what you say, sustain in the AI space, right? If you look at the foundational model companies, they have to burn through 10s of billions of dollars to just maintain a 12 Q, 18 month of lead against open source communities. Of course, we're not even trying to do that. We don't have access to that level of funding or talent. But I think, like a technical barrier is not impossible, but pretty tough to sustain. Like, you can have a technical barrier upfront, but in the long term, I think that's probably hard to sustain. But for the UX part, I think that makes, definitely makes a lot of sense. Because, like, if you look at other consumer facing applications, like Robin Hood, like I was among the first users of Robin Hood when you just got out. It was very bad in terms of product offerings. You could only trade stocks. You could only buy and sell those stocks. You can even short them. You don't have, like, stock lending options. You couldn't trade bonds, you couldn't trade treasuries, you couldn't trade options, you couldn't trade anything. But they had, they had, like, brilliant UI, right? Yeah. And their simplistic UI really captured the young retail investors like me, Bucha underground, like Schwab fidelity, they all sucked, even though they had much, much better product offerings. So like Robin Hood, still curved out a market in like a very What should I say, on a market dominated by legacy players, right? So UX is definitely going to be very important, and especially since for this space, as you say, like even more so than Robin Hood, which is like slightly a market, marketplace ish type of business model, right? But for this type of space, like you really need to capture the first bunch of users and keep them on your platform to make your model actually useful to them and better than other solutions out there. So I think it's definitely a going to be interesting market. I think there will be, but I feel like there will be, like, a couple of, at least a couple of companies out there. I'm not sure, like, if this space was like, 111, player takes all type of business, like, like E commerce platform for Amazon, yeah, or for, like, data centers, for like, AWS and a drawer, right?

S Speaker 120:25So it's in the next version. They haven't launched that part yet, but they've solved the voice AI part so that. So I think for UI, a very important part of would also be the UI front of it. And how quickly are you able to sort of capture users, because it's also getting there first, getting that mind space first. So are you thinking about a big launch, or anything like that, like going for some virality part of spreading? GTM,
So it's in the next version. They haven't launched that part yet, but they've solved the voice AI part so that. So I think for UI, a very important part of would also be the UI front of it.

So are you thinking about a big launch, or anything like that, like going for some virality part of spreading? GTM,
S Speaker 220:55yeah, that is something we have been working on. Like, we've been trying to think of a lot of like, should say, creative and cost efficient, ongoing market approaches, like we spent some time thinking about using like influencer marketing for this type of product, right? Because we're going after consumers, that's our primary testing segment, and see things go and it could make sense if we get a very clean UI, and we can get someone who's interesting to work with us, but we have to test it out after the launch first. Like we want to polish the UI like we spent a good amount of money on product designer. We want to get that done first, because without a good AI, I think it's quite tough. We want to move away from the, I should say, very stereotypical chat based UI that everyone has right perplexity, chatgpt, like they even have the same cutter theme. They can't even bother to change the cutter. Did you just want to stick with a professional clean Apple type of a design, I guess. But yeah, like, your question, like, viral is definitely something we want to go after. So like, even for our product development, we are thinking about, like, what are some of the features that could go viral and get adopted very fast, right? So initially we came across this idea of having a like video or like, what you say, a generation feature for Instagram posts things like that, right? So if you feed it some info, or post some info from your other data sources, it can generate videos for you, and you can constantly revise it with additional prompts. We eventually decided to scrap the idea for two reasons. First of all, like the idea was, I think not that novel I've seen. I come across quite a few companies that are also working things like that. And second of all, it's very, very costly. So if we say, if you use runway as your video generation API, you have to spend 1.5 dollars for a 32nd video if you allow people to use revise, like a couple of times, and if you do, they generate multiple videos a month. They're spending like $30 in infrastructures costs from that API. We cannot charge people like a few $100 that is not a computer pricing the market, right? So we decided to scrap the idea and like, then we decided to go something that's simpler and could be implemented immediately. And then we decide to, I should say, brainstorm other futures down the line. So I think it's a very interesting market, because a lot of people are trying different things. And I don't think there's a single company that's receiving, like, a lot of capital and focusing on the same space. So, like, it's very fragmented. Everyone is doing something that's similar, but slightly different. Yeah, and people don't have like, billions of money to burn through. So no one's moving like, absurdly fast, right? There are some people who are moving ahead of others a little bit, but they're still, like, series A was like 10 or $20 $20 million dollar capital. So that's very interesting. It's very fragmented.
yeah, that is something we have been working on. Like, we've been trying to think of a lot of like, should say, creative and cost efficient, ongoing market approaches, like we spent some time thinking about using like influencer marketing for this type of product, right?

S Speaker 124:06And for these companies, akibono, that you say, let's say around which are series A they have raised some 10 $20 million of capital. What kind of traction Do you think they have? Like, how many users approximately are these guys serving today?

S Speaker 224:18Yeah, it's very hard to estimate this, right? Like if during iOS tap app you can make, you can probably make some estimates and projections based on like their comments, like stars, downloads, things like that, right? But a lot of them are web apps just like us right now. And I think many people they also have the intention to go with, like, mobile device applications down the line. So perplexing. Did this right? Like, they had a huge update to their perplex assistant, which is great. I love, I love their app. And they're, well, they're like, probably the application that I use the most often right now. But essentially, I think a lot of people are trying to do go after mobile devices afterwards, but right now, I think most people are on like web apps, so it's very hard to estimate their attraction, unless they publish it on their social media accounts or like web page and stuff, which people do not get out of too often, unless they have very, very Good numbers, and want to brag about it, right? Yeah, so I read a scam, not sure, but I think they probably do not have like, more than, say, like, 100,000 users, because at that scale, I think they would be like, widely recognized the market, right? That is like,
Yeah, it's very hard to estimate this, right?

S Speaker 225:48of the US population. So I think that at that point there would be a lot of attraction and name drops about their company and stuff. But right now, I do not hear about a single company in the space, like too often, aside, aside from people in the industry, of course. So I think no one's getting, like, too many users, which is something concerning as well, right? Like that's no one's getting a lot of users. Maybe the space doesn't work out at all. Could also be the possibility, right?
of the US population. So I think that at that point there would be a lot of attraction and name drops about their company and stuff.

S Speaker 126:20I think the space, if because people don't have a lot of users today, is because they don't have a good product, but I still would say that the space is there. I personally see myself as a user, and I do see the space to be there. It's I don't know what the unlock is, because this fish audio guys, akibono, I was talking to them for quite a long time, and they're doing good in terms of traction. Their voice models are really, really good, and now they plan to expand into the entire mobile agentic system. So connect with data sources and do things like that. Interesting space for sure. They they have traction in the open source community, so they see a lot of people coming from that that side. And they in their early test, they would say that there is willingness to pay in this market, for sure. But they're still early. So I don't know exactly on how this goes, but I agree this is a very interesting space.
I think the space, if because people don't have a lot of users today, is because they don't have a good product, but I still would say that the space is there.

So I don't know exactly on how this goes, but I agree this is a very interesting space.
I think the space, if because people don't have a lot of users today, is because they don't have a good product, but I still would say that the space is there. I personally see myself as a user, and I do see the space to be there. It's I don't know what the unlock is, because this fish audio guys, akibono, I was talking to them for quite a long time, and they're doing good in terms of traction. Their voice models are really, really good, and now they plan to expand into the entire mobile agentic system. So connect with data sources and do things like that. Interesting space for sure. They they have traction in the open source community, so they see a lot of people coming from that that side. And they in their early test, they would say that there is willingness to pay in this market, for sure. But they're still early.

So I don't know exactly on how this goes, but I agree this is a very interesting space.
S Speaker 227:25Yeah, so like, I still feel like, like, it'll be very easy for for the foundational model companies to go after this market, but they have not been doing anything in the market, and they have been very reluctant to do anything about, like, user data related. So I feel like at this point, I'm not sure if they're going to do anything in the market in the near future. If they do, everyone has to make a pivot or shut down the business, right? So that is definitely going to be the largest risk factor out there. Um, and like one, I mean, if they just work on that, that would solve a lot of headaches. Just use your product.

S Speaker 128:06Yes, yes, I agree. I one question. I have Aki Bono, maybe two questions, actually. So how do you think perplexity is mobile application, mobile assistant, would expand in this way, like start connecting to your internal apps. Do you see that happening?
Yes, yes, I agree. I one question. I have Aki Bono, maybe two questions, actually. So how do you think perplexity is mobile application, mobile assistant, would expand in this way, like start connecting to your internal apps. Do you see that happening?
Yes, yes, I agree. I one question. I have Aki Bono, maybe two questions, actually. So how do you think perplexity is mobile application, mobile assistant, would expand in this way, like start connecting to your internal apps. Do you see that happening?
Yes, yes, I agree. I one question. I have Aki Bono, maybe two questions, actually. So how do you think perplexity is mobile application, mobile assistant, would expand in this way, like start connecting to your internal apps. Do you see that happening?
S Speaker 228:22Yeah, they are already moving towards that direction. Is what I'm noticing. Like over the past two months, their updates have been consistently shifting towards more what should say, user data related search, right? Yeah. I mean, foundation, fundamentally, they're a search company, but they are trying to integrate with more user data, like with their iOS app. It's was like the iOS data, of course. But that being said, they are still very cautious in terms of how they leverage user data. So for one, they do not store any data server side. So like all their data access is device constraint, and you save if you have multiple icons, I do that will cause some friction. If you have data that's not like, synchronized on iCloud or somehow have different accounts and stuff like that. So again, I think they are probably more, a lot more dangerous than, like, open AI for the space, they're more they're a larger risk. But that being said, I do not see them as a direct, direct participant in the market just yet. It could be very sad there is always as risk, I don't know. But right now, I don't think that's the case, because they're after too large of market to take the approach like us. We store everything, but we only care about users who don't care about data securities. They cannot do that many people do care about data securities, and they have to their market is too like they have to go such a larger market they can really take that approach like us. So I'm not sure if they're like the like apple to apple company. I think the smaller companies out there are going to be our largest competitor, competitor. And if the market works, and we, if we die, I think it's going to because of those small, other small companies, and not because of perplexing period, something like very extreme,
Yeah, they are already moving towards that direction. Is what I'm noticing.

S Speaker 130:20right? I get that for sure, and like from your expectation, what kind of people do you see adopting numi first, and what kind of use cases do you expect, mostly to happen after you
right? I get that for sure, and like from your expectation, what kind of people do you see adopting numi first, and what kind of use cases do you expect, mostly to happen after you
right? I get that for sure, and like from your expectation, what kind of people do you see adopting numi first, and what kind of use cases do you expect, mostly to happen after you
right? I get that for sure, and like from your expectation, what kind of people do you see adopting numi first, and what kind of use cases do you expect, mostly to happen after you
S Speaker 230:35Yeah, that's exactly why we're trying to test after the launch. So far right now, like we have, we have about, like, 8000 active users right now. And right now, everyone uses the platform as a free alternative to other models, because we do not, we're not placing a cap yet, and, like, on the back end, we just use, like, other models. So, like, it's free product. People like free stuff. Nothing to
Yeah, that's exactly why we're trying to test after the launch. So far right now, like we have, we have about, like, 8000 active users right now. And right now, everyone uses the platform as a free alternative to other models, because we do not, we're not placing a cap yet, and, like, on the back end, we just use, like, other models.

So, like, it's free product. People like free stuff. Nothing to
31:00forget about this.
S Speaker 231:02But based on our interviews with some of the people who are already on the platform, I think there are three segments that could be interesting and also what we're trying to target. So the first one is, like the consumers, but like for high performing professionals like you and me, right? Everyone is going to value context relevance in the future, like, it's context relevant AI responses and like agentic workflows, is always going to be better than, like, generic workforce, but I think only a very small fraction of the people would be willing to pay a premium for that, right? Essentially, everyone is it. Everyone is a GPT rapper at this point, but that doesn't hinder your competitive advantage in the long term. But essentially, for people to willing to pay for that premium, I think you have to value the productivity boost a lot, right? So we were thinking, who'd benefit from a couple of hours of context feeding time a month. So that's going to be like, high performing professionals like you, venture capitalist, management consultants, things like, things like that, not the average person, right? Not the average person. They can just manually feed the data. They will not pay a premium for that type of reference. I do not think they would be great if they do, I would be happy. I would love to be proven wrong, but I'm not too optimistic about it. And the other segment would be, again, like smaller businesses, like, actually, we have a good amount of instructions on the platform for from, like, very small mom and pop shops and stuff like that. And they say they don't want to pay charging beauty. They think it's too expensive $20 they don't want to pay for that. That's why they're using our free product. So I think that could be an interesting market, like the willingness to pay was quite, quite, quite low for that segment, although I think if their willingness is so low, I'm not sure if they're willing to pay for our product, right? That is another segment. And the third segment, which was very, very interesting, was higher education students. This was very unexpected, yeah, because I always thought students have a very, very low willingness to pay, right? But turns out, they have the very, very high willingness to pay for this type of product. Like about half of the students I talk to, they already have some sort of paid subscription for models like GPT, perplexity, afrobeck, some of them got the subscriptions from like affiliate marketing, like LinkedIn membership or Uber one membership. But many of them paid their cash on those applications, which was very interesting to me, and they're also very open minded to try out different platforms. I was like, if you already have a subscription for open IO or like purpose or why did you even bother to try out a movie? Like we're a no name company. They're like, Oh, we just want to cut out different things, like different things differently. And they want, like, better prompt, engineered responses, things like that. They want shorter responses. They want, like, longer responses and things like that. So this higher education market is actually quite interesting, and we were trying to test out that too. Like, we hired, like, a few dozen campus ambassadors to test the market as well. Like, this was very surprising to us. We did not expect this to happen, but we'll see, like, how much of this tension, or like the information we're collecting the market actually convert. This could be just a, what should I say, a hallucinating signal, right? It might not be true even, but we want to test out, because it's really

S Speaker 134:24interesting for sure. Yeah, it's, I would love to try it out myself. I was on the platform. I tried connecting my Gmail, but it could not itself. It's, it's not approved, right now, I think next version. Would love to try the next version, when it's out, let me know for sure. Yeah,
interesting for sure. Yeah, it's, I would love to try it out myself. I was on the platform. I tried connecting my Gmail, but it could not itself. It's, it's not approved, right now, I think next version. Would love to try the next version, when it's out, let me know for sure. Yeah,

S Speaker 234:40of course, I'll give you free access to the feedback. Maybe you can provide me with some feedback.
of course, I'll give you free access to the feedback. Maybe you can provide me with some feedback.
of course, I'll give you free access to the feedback. Maybe you can provide me with some feedback.
of course, I'll give you free access to the feedback. Maybe you can provide me with some feedback.
S Speaker 134:45Yeah, absolutely. Would love to. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, absolutely. Would love to. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, absolutely. Would love to. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, absolutely. Would love to. Yeah, yeah.
S Speaker 234:49I think the market is very interesting, like the higher education segment even. I think there are a couple of companies working on K 12 education, right, or AI solutions, but for higher education, I don't really see any like meaningful players in the space. I think it's because the space is very disorganized, unstructured, like K 12. Education is very structured, right? That's pretty much structured. You only have like AP or IB courses for good sense, high schools, you have, like public schools, things like that. But for education, someone studying biology goes to like a bio lab all the time, someone studying computer science codes all the time. Like the needs are so different, so structured, yeah? So I don't think anyone's even trying to bother working on this. And we can, maybe we can be again, like the generic, lower level solution for this, but I don't know. So I'm keeping my mind open and ready to make famous other in time. Yeah, let's see.
I think the market is very interesting, like the higher education segment even.

I think there are a couple of companies working on K 12 education, right, or AI solutions, but for higher education, I don't really see any like meaningful players in the space. I think it's because the space is very disorganized, unstructured, like K 12. Education is very structured, right? That's pretty much structured. You only have like AP or IB courses for good sense, high schools, you have, like public schools, things like that. But for education, someone studying biology goes to like a bio lab all the time, someone studying computer science codes all the time. Like the needs are so different, so structured, yeah? So I don't think anyone's even trying to bother working on this. And we can, maybe we can be again, like the generic, lower level solution for this, but I don't know. So I'm keeping my mind open and ready to make famous other in time. Yeah, let's see.

S Speaker 135:40That's, that's, I think, is the most valuable thing akibona, because a lot of companies are in AI, at least it's, I agree with your first point that you said that the barrier to build and test something out has been so low, the cost is so low that you can afford to be pivoting every time, very soon, very quickly, and even even to your first point about moving from Venture now to startup. I am at that point myself. I will see the barrier of building something to be solo, that I want to create a few things, try selling them and just try something out. So I'm thinking around those lines. I have a few ideas. Maybe when we meet in person, I'd like to show some of them to you. Oh,

S Speaker 236:22yeah, sure, for sure, for sure, for sure. Actually, I have another friend, Claire, yeah, who's also from, understand, I'm not sure if you know her, but she's also thinking, like, doing a venture stuff. I think right now she's working on, like, a side project. Was another friend of hers from MVP ventures, yeah, I think you're working on, like, I should say niche, like, hiring platform, something like that. I forgot the idea.

And like, for us, we work with a lot of members are based in India, and cost efficient, quite a cost efficient, and people are hard working, and they're very knowledgeable, and nowadays, because like how well the documentations are out there, they can catch up on things very quickly. You don't need to, you don't really need to hire a lot of people from Stanford, PhDs to build a basic product. You can, maybe, after you get some traction in the market and get some money from Sequoia, right?
