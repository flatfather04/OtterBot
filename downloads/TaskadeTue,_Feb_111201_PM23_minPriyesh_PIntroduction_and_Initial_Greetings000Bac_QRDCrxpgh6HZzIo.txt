S Speaker 10:34absolutely, absolutely. And I reached out because I have tried the app myself. And personally, for me, it's always been very difficult to get onto some of these productivity apps, but particularly because you have to sort of put all your tasks in, and there's a very long time to value, I think task, it solves it very well. So I was very interested in talking to you, sort of understanding how other users are using it. Where are you in traction? And see if there is potentially a partnership opportunity here.

S Speaker 12:24for sure, for sure, when I feel you there totally. So John, what I can do here is maybe I can give you a background about Qualcomm. I've sent some small blurb over email, but I can give you an understanding on how we operate as a fund, and give you a brief background about myself as well, and then we can pass it on to you sure that was right. So I am currently an investor here. I work with Tushar, who is our Managing Director, and together, both of us, we look at our AI investment strategy. I guess in the past, personally, myself, I've worked with a lot of early stage startups. I've worked with a clean tech startup from its sea to IPO, so that was a great experience, but I've pivoted to venture about two and a half years from now. Initially worked with Morpheus ventures for a year, and then for had a short stint with Menlo Ventures as well, and then currently with Qualcomm for for about a year now, and as a fund, I guess we up. We have been around for more than 25 years. We are a corporate venture arm of Qualcomm, but we act independently. Our decisions are our own, and we don't really have to have a strategic mandate to sort of invest in a company. Our check sizes, like I mentioned, anywhere between two to 10. Preferably we our sweet spot is five to 10, so we like to come in a little bit later. Don't do a lot of very early stage deals, but in AI, we have started doing more seed companies as well. The market demands it, so we have to do it. And then we work with a lot of our companies. Given qualcomms silicon focus, we are in AI PCs right now. We are in AI mobiles, we have our own cloud inferencing chip. We are in a lot of xr devices, a lot of variables. So we sort of believe that the future of AI compute would be hybrid, and you would have a lot of your AI compute workloads run on the device as well. So for now, we have been partnering with a lot of startups on having some of them natively enabled in a lot of devices that we ship out. And then we also connect them to some of our aipc OEMs, some mobile OEMs, auto automobile OEMs, if those partnerships make sense. So we try to be strategic in that aspect. And then a lot of our portfolio companies have also sort of gone on to be a acquisition target for Qualcomm. Have gone on to sort of get Qualcomm as their enterprise customer, or act as a partner in some of our GTM partnerships as well.

S Speaker 18:53So that's amazing. That's amazing. John, thanks a lot for the overview. And I have been, I would say, have been very impressed by the fact that you guys iterate so quickly. And I you have a long list of content on YouTube, on your own blogs, and you always can sort of see a new iteration, a new product launch. But I love it totally, totally man. And I think one of the things that's been working well for you is the three pillars working, COVID Gently that you mentioned, because separately, I've used notion, and they have integrated a lot of AI features, but they don't work for me because there's a lot of time to value and there's a big learning curve. And then I've also sort of experimented. We are looking at crew AI from an investment perspective, but I've also sort of experimented understanding a lot of self done workflow automations that I can do for my own job. But just having that as an inbuilt feature for a product man or project management app makes a lot of sense. So that's that's very interesting. I'm curious, do you? Do you see a lot of on the price adoption for your app? Is it more SMB, smaller teams?

Well, how many users do you have today across different tiers? Let's say free tier. How many of those actually go on to pay and how many of them sort of have a team based membership?

S Speaker 213:09a lot. Notion Monday, even, you know, like the click of so on, but definitely Monday, Asana comes up, you know, and notion comes up. But over the past two years that hasn't been the case, right? People are very much not comparing us to those guys as much, because they see us kind of more on the innovative side and pushing the boundaries. And the more we focus on the task portion of task K, the more we see people coming to us from the Zapier, the make.com, the LAN, and people that are actually looking for a simpler solution, and you see people Zapier trying to build all these crazy tools within their platform, but it's all disconnected. So in a way, we have have to definitely think about that as well, where maybe we let people invite as many people they want, but just go usage based payments, because they are willing to pay usage base and Yamaha folks would be also willing to pay for cost to begin with right bigger contracts. So, yeah, I hope that answers your question. Yeah,

S Speaker 114:09it does. I get that. I get that. That makes a lot of sense, because personally, for me, even I was using QA to create a few agents, I've used a few other platforms, anything. And why task eight works for me is it's easy to sort of do that, but at the same time, it's the project management angle of it is a hook for me to sort of have my projects in there and then build automations on top of it, so I don't have to sort of use another Google Sheet to track my things and then have a automation which can connect to my Google Sheet. So that's that's pretty interesting, for sure. Yeah. And I

So that's that's pretty interesting, for sure. Yeah. And I
S Speaker 116:26that makes sense. John, that makes sense a lot, because most of the AI applications you would see today are either usage based or outcome based, and you see you sort of tie your pricing directly to the ROI you're giving to the client. So that makes a lot of sense, and I don't think it will be, it will be well accepted in the market as well as my initial hypothesis. Yeah. So, so John, how much have you raised till date, and where are you in terms of revenue traction?
that makes sense. John, that makes sense a lot, because most of the AI applications you would see today are either usage based or outcome based, and you see you sort of tie your pricing directly to the ROI you're giving to the client.

So, so John, how much have you raised till date, and where are you in terms of revenue traction?
S Speaker 216:56Yeah, and I think I'll touch it back on that again. I think it's some of it was just the fact that we started with test caption real time. So then a little bit stubborn, not wanting to change that. But yeah, so I mean, we did hit the 1 million ARR mark, which is a big milestone for us. And again, it's all just bottoms up and a lot of customers, but a lot of them, as I mentioned, are actually looking at using cascade enterprise side, but also the usage for automation has been going up like this, yeah, or the customers that pay. So total number of automations, as well as runs completed, as well as steps, is all like going up, you know, the roof. So it's been very exciting. Total raise right now a bit over 7 million, and we still have really healthy runway. So pretty good. And I think we're, you know, on the funding side, definitely open to strategically thinking about this. And this goes back to the timing as well, yeah. So, so the next round would technically be like series A I guess, yeah. So you mentioned
Yeah, and I think I'll touch it back on that again. I think it's some of it was just the fact that we started with test caption real time. So then a little bit stubborn, not wanting to change that.

So, so the next round would technically be like series A I guess, yeah. So you mentioned
S Speaker 118:00you're doing an insider round. Is that? Is that? And you also have some runway. So why is the inside around shaping up? And would you be raising a big round in series? A do you plan to sort of get a few strategic interests today? How are you thinking about it?

S Speaker 119:40so all the other sales you've raised, they haven't converted yet. Okay, got it. Got it. So next price round would be somewhere in 2025, dot makes sense. Yeah, yeah. I would assume you haven't put together something of a fundraising deal room, and you would not have something like that. But would you have some metrics around traction, usage, how some different verticals, the project management side of it, the task automation side of it, how some of those different verticals are growing together? And I asked that because I would love to sort of preempt this and maybe have a discussion internally as well with Qualcomm, and see if we have an enterprise play that we can partner together,
so all the other sales you've raised, they haven't converted yet. Okay, got it. Got it. So next price round would be somewhere in 2025, dot makes sense. Yeah, yeah.

20:24yeah? I mean, we
S Speaker 121:23absolutely, John, I use it a lot for my sourcing. I realized, typically for me to put everything on the Excel is difficult, but you the document import feature that you guys have built really works for me. I've put on all of my Excel spreadsheets. Sometimes I just download my order transcriptions, put it into that and then ask it to create certain startups that I need to reach out to. And I have a good so mind map visualization also is pretty interesting. So I've used the app. I haven't done played a lot with AI teams and automations myself, but I think maybe those will be useful for me as well. So I'll continue to use the product and see at the same time. I'll follow up with you with a few data points that would be good for us to know, and then we can always reconnect when the time is right for an investment round,

S Speaker 222:12yeah, sounds great. Sounds great. And yeah, that's good feedback to hear, because on the AI team side is kind of interesting, because we actually built out our own multi agent framework after crew AI was the hot thing, and we saw auto jet, and we haven't fully utilized it, or really, like put it to work, to work, by connecting everything. So that piece of the puzzle, the technology is there. We didn't open source that. Obviously, we did our own iteration on it, but it could be kind of cool, but it's good. Yeah, it's good to hear that. You know some of these parts, it was advanced, you can touch on it
yeah, sounds great. Sounds great.

S Speaker 122:53There's always work to do, but, but allow me to sort of use some of those features as well. Over the next 1015, days, maybe I'll come back to you with a good, detailed feedback report on my end.
