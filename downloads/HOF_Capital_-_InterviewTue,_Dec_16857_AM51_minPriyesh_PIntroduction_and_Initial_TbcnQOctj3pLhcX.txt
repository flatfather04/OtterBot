S Speaker 15:39I'm originally from India. That's where I did my undergrad from. Spent about four years working in India before I made a move to the US I've been in. I came to the US for my MBA. Did my MBA a couple of years back, and I have currently been at Qualcomm ventures as a senior associate, investing in their AI and robotics team. But just to give you a little bit more detail, I did my undergrad from India at IIT Madras, and my discipline was very similar to yours, biological engineering. But while academically, I was not as interested. I realized I love entrepreneurship. And during the entire undergrad, I started working with different startups across different sectors, and took projects from growth to go to market to product, data analysis, branding, things like that. Ended up working with 10 plus different startups during my entire undergrad experience, and wanted to be in that space. So I very proactively did not take a job at Unilever in the brand strategy team or with Flipkart in the product management team and joined a very early stage clean tech startup founded by McKinsey execs, and they were trying to sort of create wind and solar farms in India and then sell that power as a long term SaaS kind of proposition to corporates like Facebook meta, which have their own R and D centers in India. So I joined their early business development team roughly around series, a LED Business Development for the team was promoted a couple of times, led a lot of their portfolio strategy team worked in corporate by the time I was leaving, and roughly, personally, brought about $17 million in ARR and started a few new verticals for the team. So great experience, but I realized I still wanted to go back into the early stage, and that's why I decided to make a move to us will sort of actively try to recruit into venture. And I did the same thing I did during my undergrad Victor, while I was at my MBA. So during my MBA, I decided to make a move into venture I have to be in that job. Actively started recruiting for internships during my entire time, I worked with five different funds at my MBA, took the student leadership positions, started working at the student fund to just get myself familiar with the entire venture ecosystem. I spent a lot of time with Morpheus ventures, which is an LA based fund. And then, before I graduated, spent about roughly six months with Menlo Ventures in the Bay Area team, and then joined Qualcomm ventures right out right after I graduated, at Qualcomm ventures. Since in the last couple of years, I've worked on six deals which have spanned across AI, both applications and infra, and one robotics deal. And those, those are my primary focus areas as well.

S Speaker 18:36to end up? I would in the long term when Victor I would like to start a fund of my own, or maybe even start a startup. If things go that way, I haven't 100% decided, but I'd like to do things on my own, and I think in the middle term, I would like to move from a corporate venture fund to a more financial focused fund. Have more skin in the game. Preferably, want to do more than what my current role and the scope allows, and then build apart towards, eventually, starting a fund, joining the general partnership or starting a venture,

S Speaker 29:07makes sense. And today, at your current job at Qualcomm ventures, I'm sure there's a lot that you like. What are the things that maybe you don't like as much and you're looking to kind of like, maybe, you know, kind of not like, repeat again, kind of your next, yes, like,

S Speaker 19:24like you mentioned Victor. There's a lot that I like, for sure. Early into venture, Qualcomm ventures, the brand itself has given me, has opened a lot of doors for me, and I've been able to, sort of, I approach different investments in a very thesis, like style. So even if I have, say, a good, opportunistic opportunity at an investment I like to create a thesis of my own, try to see if I can at least speak to 50, 60% of the market and really understand all the different wedges that different companies are approaching through that has been great at Qualcomm ventures. However, at the same time, when once, there have been times where I've completed a thesis, I've had all the investment team on board, and eventually it does not align with the mandates that Qualcomm has, either as a corporate or the strategic decision that they want to take in that aspect, Something funny is that I spent a lot of time in robotics and realized that we should make investment in a couple of early stage companies, which seemed very much stronger proposition, but we ended up investing in figures $40 billion round, which wasn't my recommendation. So my thesis felt flat in that space. Also for me to grow I'm a senior associate right now due to be promoted to a principal soon. For me to grow from here would be to form more deeper relationships within Qualcomm business units, try to understand company strategy and see if I can map that to the outer world. That's a career path that I do not foresee for myself. I would like to be in venture for the role of a venture capitalist, and that's why that's like, my primary motive to think of a move out.

S Speaker 210:59Yeah, makes sense. Makes sense. And then when you think about like, what your current experiences you've had a chance to at least be on the corporate venture side and have chance to be involved in like six deals. What would you say? What was kind of like your level involvement in each of these deals? What roles did you play?

S Speaker 111:17Yes. So Victor, the team currently at Qualcomm Ventures is structured in a way that everyone there. It's a nine member investment team. Everyone, apart from me, is a partner, so I'm the only senior associate, and I get to work with everyone. So for all of these six deals, I have run the entirety of due diligence on my own. I've made the memos. I have done all the customer calls, all the product diligence, all the financial model building and everything on the back end, I have also sourced a couple of deals, which actually finally got shot down by the im because of Qualcomm strategic fit, but the team was ready to write a check. And couple of deals that I've sourced as well. So I would say I have gotten very strong intelligence. I approach things via thesis, and I can do everything that goes behind the scenes at the same time, I have also very actively sourced for the company, and say, roughly, have about 250, to 300 companies in my personal portfolio that I track and sort of reach out to

Everyone has strengths and weaknesses, even personally, and that kind of feeds into maybe what they're good at when it comes to their job, and how they kind of like contribute, right? So what, what do you really think are your like more like your superpowers in a way, as a VC investor, and where do you think, relatively speaking, are you a bit weaker?
S Speaker 214:41Makes sense. Makes sense, just great. Let's see what is you've seen a lot of companies or companies that you advocated for. Unfortunately, Qualcomm didn't invest in others you know, you're involved with, but it did invest in what's what are like, the one or two or three top companies that you can recall that you were, like, the most bullish on, yeah, highest conviction, and that these were going to be great companies,

S Speaker 115:05absolutely, absolutely Victor. So I'll give you one that we did invest in, one that I sourced, but we did not. The company that we did invest in is called, they're actually stealth right now, but they're called airtap. This is a company creating an AI infrastructure for AI agents to use mobile phones as an artifact. So mobile phones currently are wall garden by Apple or Google, and there aren't a lot of agentic surfaces which have been built on the mobile itself. People, in fact, are targeting wearables more than or XR more than what they are targeting mobile, but there's a huge user base, huge amount of apps and services that run exclusively on mobile. So these guys have a very interesting infrastructure angle to it. They are creating a mobile so they have data centers where they've actually hosted mobiles. And every time you install airtap on your mobile phone, they create a virtual replica of a mobile phone in their data center and have agentic surfaces run on that virtual mobile they these guys are from, from a benchmarking perspective, the best at Android world benchmark, which is the benchmark of running agentic surfaces on mobile phones. And the founder has built a startup in the past called now GG, which was an mobile emulator to run PC games on mobile, sorry, mobile games on PC. So he has built this level of infrastructure, scaled it to more than 100 million users. Has really good understanding of the consumer market and how he can scale this. He first wants to start this as a consumer app. If that does not work out, they have a strong downside protection of using this as an infrastructure and sort of drawing parallels to the browser use side of the world as mobile use infrastructure. So I feel this is a very strong proposition. We invested in seed round when they were pre product, but had a working demo. And the demo itself, I ran very extensive use case, gave it to a lot of my friends. Was interesting to see how different consumers would come out with very different use cases of an infrastructure like this. So I see a lot of consumer apps being built on top of airtap if airtaps own consumer app does not work as well, yeah.

Yeah. Interesting. How have they done since you guys invested?
S Speaker 217:54Awesome, awesome. How? How large of a company do you think air tap can become across different timeframes, yes, like how they could be in 10 years, maybe 20 years, 30 years,

S Speaker 223:51Great, great info. You know, just love your explanations, right about, like, why you're interested, what documents about? Okay, I want you this next question I have for you is very speculative. Yes, speculative. I understand speculative. No one, no one knows the right answer. But I know a lot of people can, can usually have some kind of vision for maybe what next year might be like. Okay, so it's not the hardest thing to do, to predict next year. Just carry today's trend lines that have, you know, 12 months in the future harder to kind of, like, think about what things will look like in 30 years, right? That's a long time, yes, and things change quite a bit, but I want you to try that, and I want you to tell me what you think the world is going to be like in 30 years, especially on the technology side. And I'd love to hear like, that vision of the future, right? In terms like the technology that we had at that point in time.

S Speaker 228:17Yeah. Great. And then, you know, in 30 years, and there are going to be some new companies that have been formed between now and then that are going to become some of the most viable companies. Are, right? We always see this, you know, every new generation, there's some new companies that like become monstrous companies. All some of the incumbents will, of course, still be here, and they'll still like, dominate their respective spaces. Where do you think most of the value will accrue? Like, what which new kind of market opportunities do you think value accrued in 30 years? Where's going to be the iconic companies of tomorrow? Where are they going to be in 30 years? Like, which markets are they going to be playing in? And, and will that be a new company, a new startup they think will win that space, versus like incumbent? I'm just curious now. So basically, where do you think are gonna be, like the multi trillion
Yeah. Great. And then, you know, in 30 years, and there are going to be some new companies that have been formed between now and then that are going to become some of the most viable companies.

So basically, where do you think are gonna be, like the multi trillion
S Speaker 129:07dollar companies in 30 years, a couple of spaces, Victor one I think would be memory. A memory company would be a multi billion dollar company. For sure, I we recently in the team discussed humans and which is a new sort of foundation model lab company led, I really like the approach that they are taking to memory. One of the thesis is I have, is that all the memory level companies currently working today are more, say, applications focused, so they build a memory layer for an application to then use and build their own agentic workflow. I think memory would be more consumer front so you and I will own our own memory, and we will have the decision to sort of pass this memory to an agentic application we are using, and have that being personalized based on our usage. That's the approach I really like about humans hand, and I believe they plan to launch a few consumer apps to see if those will work, and use that to sort of have memories generated. There's another very early stage company, pickle, working on memory for consumers. And I think there'll be a very strong company built in this front. So that's that's one, I would say another would be on synthetic humans. I think I'm spending a lot of time understanding agentic swamps, which is a lot of agents working in interaction, in conjunction, and doing, say, almost brute forcing their way through a solution. What I really like, one of the applications I like about this technology is on generating synthetic humans, so they can they actually replicate entire demographics and sort of based on the demographic data that they get, and synthetically generate some data? Can they really sort of understand how population of California would react and the applications of that can go into product demos, can they sort of really save this particular feature in this product would work or not? Or in fact, in user research, product research, brand taste research, anything of that front, even politics, policy making, things like that. So I feel just having a population of synthetic humans and being able to use that to test out a lot of hypothesis. will be a very big market tracking a few early stage startups in this space who haven't cracked it yet, but huge use cases, especially in white coding as well, as we start to create more and more software, we need to have shorter feedback timing and actually have agents also test it out. So I would say synthetic human populations, one one strong company in this space. And lastly, I would say in generative UI, again, follows the personalization trend. I've seen multiple of my friends use the same YouTube app in different ways. One of my friends would always go open the YouTube app and click on the 2x speed button, because he likes to view, say, a video in 2x always, these UIs have to be frictionless. They have to be hyper personalized to an user, even though the value end value proposition is the same. So I believe generative UI would be a big thing. Tracking a few companies which are working on generative websites, which I see, which seems like a precursor to generative UI in the front in the data stages, but I think one, one large company in this space as
dollar companies in 30 years, a couple of spaces, Victor one I think would be memory. A memory company would be a multi billion dollar company.

S Speaker 232:49I won't take too much more of your time. But this is great, and by the way, so maybe two last questions on my side really quickly. One is, I'm just curious, you know, like, I want to dig a little deeper into, you know, one of your thesis So, for example, like humans and right, they're doing the memory, they're applying memory to essentially, kind of like, I guess one thing I was wondering, you know, there is just, like, what's different about their tech? Is there anything that they're technologically going to do different, right? Or how defensible Do you really think what they're working on
I won't take too much more of your time. But this is great, and by the way, so maybe two last questions on my side really quickly. One is, I'm just curious, you know, like, I want to dig a little deeper into, you know, one of your thesis So, for example, like humans and right, they're doing the memory, they're applying memory to essentially, kind of like, I guess one thing I was wondering, you know, there is just, like, what's different about their tech? Is there anything that they're technologically going to do different, right? Or how defensible Do you really think what they're working on

S Speaker 235:39make sense. Last question on my side for you is just, you know, you don't have, like, kind of a sweet background, you know, we're not kind of formally trained in AI at this point in time. How technical Have you become, in a way, in that area, like, how much software engineering Do you know? How much of the actual like, you know, building an AI model? Do you know? I'm just curious. Yeah.

S Speaker 136:06Victor, so, yes, I've been trying to get more technical jobs in that area. From, from, say, last year, I have read through a lot of research papers. I understand system diagrams. I understand which modules work or may not work, and what are the business application implications, product implications, or something like that. More recently, I've started coding myself. I have realized that it's just the best time to be building and I don't want to be left out. I've started with white coding. I've recently started using all the agentic IDs I've created, say, three or four applications of myself, all multi agent systems which work well. So I have a hands on understanding of, say, rag memory, fine tuning, things prompt engineering and things like that. I want to go ahead also start sort of fine tuning my own model. See if I can train something on my own data. I write short stories, so I want to create an agent for that. I'm being very hands on. I think I understand everything technically and theoretically very well, trying to understand, at least for on the ML ops side, try to be as hands on as I can, to understand that entire life cycle. Think most of this December break. Plan to do that. And I think next January, I would be very hands or experientially trained on these stuff. I don't think I will go very deep into software engineering, per se, trying to understand all of that. I think my the way, or where I want to end up, is having a very deep sense of ml ops being able to use vibe coding or agentic IDs to the extent I can, and maybe some of the production scale security issues is something I wouldn't go very hands on. Yeah.

S Speaker 237:54Great, great, awesome. I want to give you five minutes here to just like, pepper me with questions that you have. So if you have, like, you know, top one, two or three questions, let me know, and I'll try to answer them as well

S Speaker 138:06as we can. Yeah. Victor, one question, which I feel would be super interesting is, would love to just understand Hof approach on investing. I have read through some of your blogs, and the abundance thesis makes a lot of sense. It's super exciting. But I'd love to understand how you are approaching, say, any application investing today, there's not a lot of mode what really makes the team sort of think that this will move the needle. What kind of risks are you open to underwriting for?
as we can. Yeah. Victor, one question, which I feel would be super interesting is, would love to just understand Hof approach on investing.

S Speaker 147:03that's, that's incredible Victor, and congrats on the Aom explosion. That's, that's super inspiring and amazing to hear. Maybe one, one quick question, if I can just follow up, Victor, the am explosion has been incredible. What kind of velocity do you see in terms of investing, deal size, deal velocity that you sort of foresee for the next year?
that's, that's incredible Victor, and congrats on the Aom explosion. That's, that's super inspiring and amazing to hear.

47:27All right, great question.

All right, great question.
47:30Let's see the I mean, because
Let's see the I mean, because
Let's see the I mean, because
Let's see the I mean, because
S Speaker 247:34we're multi stage, it, you know, really depends, you know, the deal, the deal size for us, like, depends on kind of stage, obviously, as you know, seed stage. I mean, you can only put so much money right into those rounds at the growth stages, though, we can write big checks. So historically, we've written checks even in the 250 to a billion dollar range, right? So right now we're doing this, like, $1.2 billion investment related to our portfolio companies. So that's the highest end, you know, so far. So that's that's imminently closing, right? And we've done a bunch of, like, $250 million kind of checks, so we can write checks at large now, in terms of, like, the actual volume, you know, again, you know, I think we're going to still try to be pretty concentrated. So on the early stage side,
we're multi stage, it, you know, really depends, you know, the deal, the deal size for us, like, depends on kind of stage, obviously, as you know, seed stage.

So on the early stage side,
48:18I would probably say
S Speaker 248:21somewhere between six to 12 new investments next year. Doesn't mean that doesn't count fall ones, obviously, we want to continue supporting our existing portfolio companies. So six to 12 new investments, and then for the growth stage side, you're probably, probably about
somewhere between six to 12 new investments next year. Doesn't mean that doesn't count fall ones, obviously, we want to continue supporting our existing portfolio companies. So six to 12 new investments, and then for the growth stage side, you're probably, probably about

S Speaker 148:36in the same range, right? Got it, got it. And maybe I'm sorry about this, but maybe one last quick question, Victor, where, where do you see the new person that you'll bring along in the team? Sort of, which stage, which areas, where, where do you see them adding value?
in the same range, right? Got it, got it. And maybe I'm sorry about this, but maybe one last quick question, Victor, where, where do you see the new person that you'll bring along in the team? Sort of, which stage, which areas, where, where do you see them adding value?

S Speaker 248:53Great, great question. Like, right now we are, you know, looking for someone to potentially join the early stage team, and we're looking for someone who just can shore up some of our weaknesses. Right? There are different like, areas where we we are very intellectually honest with ourselves, and we know that there are some areas where we're not like the best, you know, probably someone who has complimentary networks. You know, we do think that we're under networked in, for example, the Bay Area. Yeah, right, because we're headquartered in New York, we have one team member in Bay Area. I grew up in the bay area, but I'm not based there at the moment, you know. So we were flying and out all the time. But it's still different flying in and out versus being permanently based. Yes, someone probably with the complementary network. There someone who probably has spent time looking into market opportunities that we haven't, right. So, like, they can bring some complimentary knowledge, complimentary relationships in that area, you know, ideally, some level of technical understanding. We just think that's like, really valuable, some level of operational experience. You know, we think that's really valuable, and especially like startups, etc. So those are, like, some of the obvious things that like come to mind. So yeah, ultimately, though, it's about really finding someone that we believe could potentially become an all time great PC investor and would be cultural Absolutely. So obviously, we're open minded, just like we are open minded just like we are open minded with the companies that we invest in. You know, we always know that, like the next trillion dollar company can come from different fields, yeah, you know, same thing, yeah. We think the all time great. And VC investors can come from different backgrounds, so we're open minded about that

Priyesh, maybe in terms of next steps, what I'll do is I'll just circle back with you, probably within, you know, a couple days to about a week or so. Okay, I just want to talk it over with selection committee, and we'll kind of figure out, like, whether we think there could be a good fit here, sure, and then, and then go from there. Absolutely.
