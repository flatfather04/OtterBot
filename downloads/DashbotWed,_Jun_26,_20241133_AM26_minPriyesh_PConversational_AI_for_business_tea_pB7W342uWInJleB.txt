S Speaker 14:11So Gong and chorus that's been space.
4:17Yes. Similar to a space. That's right. Yeah. Okay. So
Yes. Similar to a space. That's right. Yeah. Okay. So
Yes. Similar to a space. That's right. Yeah. Okay. So
Yes. Similar to a space. That's right. Yeah. Okay. So
S Speaker 14:19so so it's essentially but I mean, Gong and Gong in the early days was focused primarily on sales Ms. And so as a chorus, chorus got acquired and, and then, you know, gone figured out a way to do this revenue intelligence thing. They called it they don't even call it conversational intelligence. I think they weren't on conversational intelligence to revenue intelligence. And so So who, so they couldn't sell to not just a sales team. I think there was they started selling into finance teams. And so who do you sell to like, you're probably you're already going to them Gong and chorus in your journey. Who do you sell to? And then what's your differentiation versus like a garden?

S Speaker 25:13These are good questions. So we saw the three primary team say, you know, obviously we're certainly it's customer experience to is some kind of digital team. So somebody in charge of like digital experiences. And the third one I call they call this like a contact center team, and they can encompass human agents and like automated agents, so it's planning on sales. Not always it can be support. Okay. Got it. Got it. So with something like a gong, they are the leader in you know, revenue or sales related conversational intelligence. A lot of our customers have this kind of use case. Which is I have 700, contacts, intelligence. There's some like bespoke tools. I realize that but I also have a chatbot that it's going to set agent I need to analyze all this data at scale. gadong is just not meant for that, right. Like they're very vertical specific. But when you're trying to blend different data sources in a business there's no I'm like agnostic tool as like that. Probably coming.

S Speaker 26:31so Unifor so we met them a few times they do a lot of like speech to text transcription, some analytics there. We haven't gone toe to toe with them. Actually. Sometimes we actually pull the Unifor data into dashboard, and we kind of partner with them.

S Speaker 28:25On the other side, but it may be the first tool, but I imagine they focus very heavily in like contact center agent analysis and coaching I imagine it right yes. And

S Speaker 28:39right. So you also we will take a much broader approach. I mean, let me give you an use case example that like gives up on the field there. So we're about to close a deal with the NBA. And so their main use case was we don't have a support team and you can't call them the support and, you know, talk about some kind of complaint. But after every single NBA call, they pay a million dollars a year for culture surveys. And so after you attend the game, every single day, across every single team, they send out a survey, you fill it on your phone, and one of the questions is an open ended field. And so people can talk about paragraphs, and they said we get 10s of 1000s of open ended responses per game, and we have no idea what to do. And today if you think about it, a lot of people do things like topic modeling, which is like keyword searching like something is like noise or something right? And so they're like, Can you analyze this? So like what is that doesn't have anything to do with contact center agents, like we can service anywhere where there's language, and so we did that very well which is like across different teams. What are the major themes happening? And like you can start to blend it with things like financial data. So we start to tie in LTV of customers with what are they complaining about? So that's one use case but because we did that, they also said oh, we have different use cases beyond like fence surveys which is interesting for but we don't focus specifically on contact center agents or, you know, like sales calls like condos, we're trying to be like a one plot one, one stop shop on a data layer, essentially.
right. So you also we will take a much broader approach. I mean, let me give you an use case example that like gives up on the field there. So we're about to close a deal with the NBA.

S Speaker 110:05So you don't care about so the example in case of the NBA would be you're collecting data from so what are all the input sources for that data and then what's the output and who's consuming that output?

S Speaker 210:24So the inputs in that use case is Qualtrics and directly to snowflake, in which they have all the structured metadata like, like email style TV, all that stuff. The output is it's a blend of like BI reports and tools. Right? So like analysis essentially, and who's consuming it is their analytics and in such teams, they have a whole division globally that analyzes this okay.

S Speaker 211:22So, it's typically twofold if you're talking about ROI it's like, you know, cost savings and cost reduction and like revenue generation. Yeah. So because we collect all the data, we can actually measure it right. So in the NBS use case, it's a little bit difficult, but because we get fed, and level data, let's say I get an insight such as in half of my stadiums, they're complaining about non alcoholic beer options that I can tie this to all the fans, if they implement non alcoholic beers. In those stadiums, I can actually see the LTV increase from a sentence, but we can track it so we can actually track all this same thing with cost savings right? So for example, we're about to sign off on commercials with Mars, which is a huge candy company. And they have like hundreds of chatbots with all their subdivisions. And so they said, Can you analyze this? Their use case is with my chatbot can't answer my customer question because an agent and it could cost him money. And so we can keep track based on our insights. How much did we increase what's called a container rate that I can tell you like? How would you say with not escalating to agents, so those are typically the two ways we can measure ROI today.
So, it's typically twofold if you're talking about ROI it's like, you know, cost savings and cost reduction and like revenue generation. Yeah.

S Speaker 112:33Roi is measured in either LTV increase, which is L or in some cases concept. Okay. And then you show it on that. For that. Here's what you've saved or here's what and so currently, you so you take inputs as an audio, text. And what are the forms of unstructured data? What do you consume? Do you also take any cues from videos or

S Speaker 213:10text so if the voice were transcribed to text? Yeah, so delicious old textbooks?
text so if the voice were transcribed to text? Yeah, so delicious old textbooks?
text so if the voice were transcribed to text? Yeah, so delicious old textbooks?
text so if the voice were transcribed to text? Yeah, so delicious old textbooks?
S Speaker 113:16Okay, all textbooks. So, the forms of communication would be email or meeting notes or

Okay, all textbooks. So, the forms of communication would be email or meeting notes or
Okay, all textbooks. So, the forms of communication would be email or meeting notes or
S Speaker 213:31so yeah, I'd say like email. These are the ones we service like so email, cold transcripts, like SMS messages, survey responses, even like social data. So can be scripted Twitter feeds, my chatbot messages, live chat, really anywhere, whether it's texts, we analyze anything like zero transcription, we do.
so yeah, I'd say like email. These are the ones we service like so email, cold transcripts, like SMS messages, survey responses, even like social data.

S Speaker 113:54Okay. And so who do you sell to? So it sounds like you're targeting retailer, online retailers, CPG companies. And a few others.
Okay. And so who do you sell to? So it sounds like you're targeting retailer, online retailers, CPG companies. And a few others.
Okay. And so who do you sell to? So it sounds like you're targeting retailer, online retailers, CPG companies. And a few others.
Okay. And so who do you sell to? So it sounds like you're targeting retailer, online retailers, CPG companies. And a few others.
S Speaker 214:08At the moment, we're getting a lot of traction in like the fortune 500 global 2000 because the volume is so high on these customer interactions and their pain is high in like new tantalises. I'd say the industries are Yep, pretty much like let's say retailers is one. Insurance is a big vertical actually. So traveler's insurance is like a huge customer of ours. What else actually like digital, logical, it's like consumer digital services like Dropbox and Netflix, our customers. They just have a lot of like b2c level interactions. Interesting, but those are probably the big ones today.

14:51And the insurance companies also similar use case.
S Speaker 214:55Insurance is interesting because yes, so travelers we analyze SMS emails call transcripts and sorted responses

S Speaker 115:09interesting. And and you're so I'm assuming this is using MLMs and Alexis Okay, so using airlines, are you training your own Netherlands or
interesting. And and you're so I'm assuming this is using MLMs and Alexis Okay, so using airlines, are you training your own Netherlands or

S Speaker 215:24we have something working but yeah, most of what we do is like open AI. And like sometimes we take a look at the topic but open the screen. Well.

S Speaker 115:32I'm curious, did you send opening hours in traffic was it was there a different big difference in quality?

I'm curious, did you send opening hours in traffic was it was there a different big difference in quality?
S Speaker 215:43On some because we prompt for around different structure in sites like sentiment or most of it was about the same I think open chromed a little bit better. Whether or not it's cheaper, but um, you know, just stick with an open front.

S Speaker 220:19Yeah, but something to mention too is so we customer, we process like 10 million interactions a month. We don't send all that through a peer if we did, our cost would be like 100 grand a month. We do clever things. So we actually pull a sample each dataset into it. And then we use things like similar to like label all that data. So we've gotten around that so like there's a lot of efficiencies with built in I mean, we pay like probably two three grand on top of these contracts. So it's negligible, less than nothing.
