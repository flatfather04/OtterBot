S Speaker 10:00Support of, you know, we did first the four kites investment for kites, pure software, just, you know, you know, just a layer ingesting data from a bunch of stuff. One of the data is, the injustice is from companies like dive trackers, from dive, we looked at the space. You know, there was this aware thing. You know, supply chain visibility was a big thing. So, and we got excited about rumby and and, but Jeff Torres also wanted us to invest in dive. Okay, so dive was actually a deal we ended up doing because Jeff won it. We thought rumby had a better business model. It was more software, more recurring, etc, etc, yeah, now tells you how smart we are.

S Speaker 11:02rumby. Right five has scaled. They their key. The bet when we invested was they had this software platform, was that the you know, more and more people would buy the software platform. So the mix of recurring revenue, because a lot of the pipes revenues are like, use it, use the once, only once. Okay, right? Yeah, and that's a problem, because you have the, you know, this cogs that you have to, you know, just once. And you can, yeah, you sell it. But I do. So since then, they launched a recycle program. They incentivize, incentivize people to send it back, and with that, the gross margins will really up, because obviously you don't have to manufacture again. The tracker right, the software side of things, the platform side of things, recurring revenue hasn't really done well. They now have spent enough time they brought, brought in a CEO last year who was saying that they're gonna launch now in q4 and q1 etc. That's still part of the bet. And then they have so the nature of their contracts is such that the customers have minimum commitment. So it's because of the minimum commitment. It looks like it's recurring, right? It's not really recurring, but they call it recurring because it keeps growing.

2:38I didn't understand that piece. Carlos, what do you mean? Yeah,
I didn't understand that piece. Carlos, what do you mean? Yeah,
I didn't understand that piece. Carlos, what do you mean? Yeah,
I didn't understand that piece. Carlos, what do you mean? Yeah,
S Speaker 12:41it's so they have to, when they sign a contract, they have to say, I'm gonna, you know, take or pay. I'm gonna buy this right? And because those numbers tend to go up over time you get more customers, etc, it kind of look, because it's take or pay, they have to take it. It kind of looks like recurring. They call it recurring, but it's, it's a bit of a poetic license.

3:05Okay, okay, okay,
3:09so that's, that's the story there.
so that's, that's the story there.
so that's, that's the story there.
so that's, that's the story there.
S Speaker 13:16So we did, initially just a $2 million check. We did the $6 million check in rumby Just again, because it was like, and then they had around that first round was like at 121
So we did, initially just a $2 million check. We did the $6 million check in rumby Just again, because it was like, and then they had around that first round was like at 121

3:31And then about a year later,
And then about a year later,
And then about a year later,
And then about a year later,
S Speaker 13:35here later, and in Right, right before the Ukraine war. So that's when was Ukraine war, 2023 right, January of 23 they closed around the 50 million at 300 posts, which the market was still hasn't gone, hadn't collapsed. Crane. I got really lucky with the timing, you know. And at the time, the 300 was like a really rich valuation, yeah, but he got basically, you know, new investor to come in, etc, and we were going to lose the board observer, because, oh, you're a small check, etc. So I basically said, Hey, I'm going to do super pro rata. Did two and a half million. And with that, we secured our board observer,
here later, and in Right, right before the Ukraine war. So that's when was Ukraine war, 2023 right, January of 23 they closed around the 50 million at 300 posts, which the market was still hasn't gone, hadn't collapsed. Crane. I got really lucky with the timing, you know.

Did two and a half million. And with that, we secured our board observer,
S Speaker 24:24okay, okay, so that's two and a half.
okay, okay, so that's two and a half.
okay, okay, so that's two and a half.
okay, okay, so that's two and a half.
S Speaker 14:28So two plus two and a half, so all in, we have four and a half, and we own about 2% of the company. Got it so not, not much, right? Our pro rata for this 40, 40 million round would be 800k if it's not to get diluted, right? So company is now doing, you know it? I think it's it's a good company. It's not a great company. The good news is they grow. Keep on growing, and the metrics keep on improving. And it's not like anemic, it's like 50, 60% a year, not 2030, right? And you know, if you look at the charts, the numbers go up, etc, right? That doesn't mean that they they missed the numbers, right? So the there was issues about the sales organization. They've gone through one CRO, they've gone through another. It looks like now things are looking bad, good. Actually, there were some. Was a board meeting recently. I need to issue the notes. It's, it's, it's going okay, right? So my theory is, let's do per Rata. I don't know if we'll have room, given that it's over subscribed. Yeah, right. So the lead investor is doing 20. Another guy had done a term sheet. He will do 15. So that's 35 the round was supposed to be 40. Yeah. So and AXA, who led the last round wants to do three and and RRE wants to do two. Looks like maybe there's three and a half of secondary, preferred. So let's say there's eight and a half left. We may have room, we may not have room, but that's sort of the high level. So I think what I'd like you to do is just really take their projections, see if they're, you know, semi reasonable, and then project what do we think is an exit here, right? I mean, the reality is, given the margin profile, unless these margins improve, and unless this the software and recurring revenue story improves. The multiple should not be a great multiple, right? I'm thinking six is a six feels like a generous multiple. I'm thinking, Okay, so right now again, let's say they're doing close to 50, Arr, right? Times six, that's 300 so it's not terrible, right? I think it's just a question of, do we believe their numbers? How much do we shave the numbers? Right? And I think, you know, we should be able to do this maybe a couple of scenarios, shape this much, shape this much, shape this much, and then do that right, talking to them, and going through pipeline and all that. I don't, don't think it's gonna
So two plus two and a half, so all in, we have four and a half, and we own about 2% of the company. Got it so not, not much, right? Our pro rata for this 40, 40 million round would be 800k if it's not to get diluted, right? So company is now doing, you know it? I think it's it's a good company. It's not a great company.

I don't, don't think it's gonna
S Speaker 27:36Got it? Got this round is at 300 so it's a flat round Carlos, is that, now that's a 325-320-5320,
Got it? Got this round is at 300 so it's a flat round Carlos, is that, now that's a 325-320-5320,
Got it? Got this round is at 300 so it's a flat round Carlos, is that, now that's a 325-320-5320,
Got it? Got this round is at 300 so it's a flat round Carlos, is that, now that's a 325-320-5320,
7:435p It's slightly up, which is,
5p It's slightly up, which is,
5p It's slightly up, which is,
5p It's slightly up, which is,
7:47it's a good story.
S Speaker 17:49I'm surprised he got it right. And clearly tells you the last round was overpriced, yeah, but they it wasn't a down round. So I think that's good,
I'm surprised he got it right. And clearly tells you the last round was overpriced, yeah, but they it wasn't a down round. So I think that's good,
I'm surprised he got it right. And clearly tells you the last round was overpriced, yeah, but they it wasn't a down round. So I think that's good,

S Speaker 28:06So what will, like, what? What will make us do super product? In this case?
So what will, like, what? What will make us do super product? In this case?
So what will, like, what? What will make us do super product? In this case?
So what will, like, what? What will make us do super product? In this case?
S Speaker 18:10No, no, I don't think we want to do. I mean, look, if we wanted a chance, run the numbers with pro rata. Take a look at what the proceeds are estimated. Total proceeds are right, same exercise we did with i Five. On i Five, the valuation was lower. Of course, the revenues are much lower, but it felt like competitive wise, I feel I find better position than these guys. This is a crowded space, right? So to be honest, when I look at some of the low contract values that they have, some of the customers that they have, which are
No, no, I don't think we want to do. I mean, look, if we wanted a chance, run the numbers with pro rata. Take a look at what the proceeds are estimated. Total proceeds are right, same exercise we did with i Five. On i Five, the valuation was lower.

S Speaker 19:05ACV, low, etc. Those things tell me that, and we've had this discussion, those things tell me that we don't, clearly have a product here that's like, very unique, and, you know, so we don't have much pricing power. Let's put it this way. Yeah, right. And so because of that, I say, if we do pro rata, you know, it is what it is, we can think about what, what does that what's put us in terms of proceeds, and we want to make, try to make a push. But I don't think I have at this juncture, like when we invested last round, when I stepped up, I felt this software story, the numbers were kind of looking up. Since then, we lost one big customer. We had a big churn. It hasn't gone anywhere after two years, right? They say now they have a product, etc. But to be honest, I don't get a strong conviction that A, they know what to do. B, they know how to price, etc.
ACV, low, etc. Those things tell me that, and we've had this discussion, those things tell me that we don't, clearly have a product here that's like, very unique, and, you know, so we don't have much pricing power. Let's put it this way. Yeah, right.

ACV, low, etc. Those things tell me that, and we've had this discussion, those things tell me that we don't, clearly have a product here that's like, very unique, and, you know, so we don't have much pricing power. Let's put it this way. Yeah, right. And so because of that, I say, if we do pro rata, you know, it is what it is, we can think about what, what does that what's put us in terms of proceeds, and we want to make, try to make a push. But I don't think I have at this juncture, like when we invested last round, when I stepped up, I felt this software story, the numbers were kind of looking up. Since then, we lost one big customer. We had a big churn. It hasn't gone anywhere after two years, right? They say now they have a product, etc. But to be honest, I don't get a strong conviction that A, they know what to do. B, they know how to price, etc.

S Speaker 112:48good. I'll send you the board back from the last meeting. I haven't put the notes yet together, but basically, again, one way to think about it, when we did that, 50 million, round five zero, in theory, should have been enough to get to break even. They didn't. They're like 10 million or so, you know, 10 to 15 away from from break even. Right? So, things progress, they progress, but they don't progress with the space that they should. And so overall, you know, good story. The company again, pushing 50 million revenue. And even though not fully recurring, technically
