S Speaker 10:12And this is so Andy is now splitting his time between US and Japan. And then what I've read from there was he's incorporated the company in the US, but he's spending more time in Japan, and so the he started six months ago, they raised about $25 million seed from Andreessen, mostly, and DCM and a bunch of other VCs. And he's raising another 100 million dollars, and which he said he already has a term sheets for for this human art company. I'm still less interested in human art companies unless Nakul really I'm bringing it up, because there's a lot of back and forth between Nicole and team on this company. What they're trying to build is so he's teamed up with a bunch of roboticists and his prior team from Google and other places in Japan. And then so I'll jump to actually what he's trying to build. I

S Speaker 11:27He made an interesting point. He, while he was he actually pitched, well, he made an interesting point. He made one point that there's, there's about 12 or 15 odd companies in the US that are building humanoids, and there's 28 plus 10 more that are not in this in China and and then that's it. Those are the places where robots are getting built. There's only one region that is selling robots today, and that is no China, no Japan, not humanoids. In this case, Japan is essentially saying Japan is missing out, which is is painting a picture that Japan has all this legacy robot companies, but then Japan is missing out and and that's why he's getting support from the government and everything. Okay, so he's building his own humanoid. They're building a complete vertical integration. This is their own actuator, their own motors, their own AI models. So they're completely vertically integrated in many ways, kind of like figure AI. This is what they're building the market that they're trying to go after, and then they've shown already a bunch of videos. He had, like, a lot of demos around even manipulators that their hand is better than the Tesla Optimus hand, their hand is better than the figure AI hand. And all of that, the market that he's trying to go after initially is this one. I'll show

S Speaker 13:07This one. So he's trying to go after, you know, we've all seen those security robots in our parking lots, right? So these security robots, because, essentially, he believes, which is true, that the long tail of building consumer general purpose robots, the data collection that you need in order to get to that level of generalizability is significantly higher versus you can. Even if you have good enough manipulation, you can do a significantly better job than a human security guard, because these things are always on and those wheeled robots that we've seen in parking lots, what do

3:49you need? What do you need, arms and legs for, for security,
you need? What do you need, arms and legs for, for security,
you need? What do you need, arms and legs for, for security,
you need? What do you need, arms and legs for, for security,
S Speaker 13:57to open doors while at the same time. So he has an example here as well, which is, I'll show, yeah, to open doors or at the same time, these things can also clean up. Why? Why they are securing your premises. So this is the security robot with and take down like an intruder, yeah, look at this. This video, which
to open doors while at the same time. So he has an example here as well, which is, I'll show, yeah, to open doors or at the same time, these things can also clean up. Why?

S Speaker 14:29is, this is the robot that he wants to which is, this does indoor, outdoor cleaning, plus Open Doors plus secure premises. Essentially, I asked him this question, which is, how does this, you know, how is this better than a secure camera? Then the his question, I mean, Abby's answer was, you still have human security guards on top of cameras, because you want to be able to walk the premises and look at places where security cameras can't occluded places and open doors and all that. Right? There's some point to it. And then he says it's a easier market to target while you're connecting collecting data for everything else. He also wants to sell these things to researcher, research communities, which is something, some, something that we've heard from, what's the company here, Redwood City diner robots and a bunch of other which is, since data collection is very, very hard, you need to be enable like you need to enable the research community and developer community to go collect data. All that tells me is that this is far from commercialization. I mean, this industry in general is far from commercialization.

5:48In general, he's got a three phase approach,
In general, he's got a three phase approach,
In general, he's got a three phase approach,
In general, he's got a three phase approach,
S Speaker 15:53well, which he said it's more learning like it's learning from this Android world, which is phase one is sell robots, which is in cell rate of robots into this community, which is the security community, and then the research community.
well, which he said it's more learning like it's learning from this Android world, which is phase one is sell robots, which is in cell rate of robots into this community, which is the security community, and then the research community.

S Speaker 16:12is phase two is open these robots to third party developers and such that they can add skills, kind of like the App Store in Android. And the third phase three is, don't build the hardware at all. Just open this, you know, make this community such that people can add skills, and they just end up selling the skills marketplace. Yeah, it sounds good on paper, but I think the time that it will take. He was very bold in his predictions. He says that I can get to a billion dollars in revenue by 2030 in hardware, plus $5 billion in revenue in scales, by 2030

they want to launch this thing
S Speaker 16:57in they're announcing this robot for security in two weeks, he said, and then they're going to launch this in Cuba, which, I mean, if he's able to do that right now, it'll be the he might be the first one in the Western world. Well, Eastern in case, case there, but outside China to sell these humanoid robots. Now he pitched, well, our guys internally, achievement and Ahmed and these guys were very interested in working with them. I'm not recommending to invest. He's Andy said, I've got the money. You decide you let me know. But he wants to know an answer whether we are even thinking about it or not by this week, Quinn, I'm thinking of sending a note to Nicole and team before I convey our no or I don't have to say no to ending even though he wants, unless he pings,

is he using? You know, he's using a mobile chip.
is he using? You know, he's using a mobile chip.
S Speaker 19:07He's using a mobile chip. So because he's got engineers who from the Android world who already are very familiar with our chips. So the good news here is that he's already using our chips without us selling them. Yeah, so, and he's working with AMD on a custom chip. So,
He's using a mobile chip. So because he's got engineers who from the Android world who already are very familiar with our chips. So the good news here is that he's already using our chips without us selling them. Yeah, so, and he's working with AMD on a custom chip. So,

run around. Qualcomm, yeah. We had it Yeah.
run around. Qualcomm, yeah. We had it Yeah.
S Speaker 111:21They used to Yeah. All those companies haven't done well, those security robot companies, none of them during video
They used to Yeah. All those companies haven't done well, those security robot companies, none of them during video
