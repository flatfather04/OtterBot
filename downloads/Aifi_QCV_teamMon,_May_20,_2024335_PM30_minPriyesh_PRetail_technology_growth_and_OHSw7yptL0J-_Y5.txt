S Speaker 10:00refocus where we were going to go deploy this technology, specifically in places that could pay us what we needed in order to generate the right kinds of margins and to be self sufficient, which was really more what we would consider Grab and Go locations versus say grocery. So that a different way, a shopper journey of say, several minutes, three or four items, potentially a captive audience, so at places like stadiums, travel, hospitality, even places like movie movie houses, as opposed to grocery, which is typically more of say a 20 or more minute shopping trip, you're interacting with a lot of products and you're not buying them all. You're putting picking some up putting some down, right, and it's a very low margin business to begin with. So we couldn't really charge what we wanted to charge to offset our costs and still have a margin. And so that's why we shifted if you will, away from sort of this large format grocery store to more of these. Like I said, captive audience and so Fabio if you if you progress the slides a little bit what you're going to see then is we had a Forex

S Speaker 11:21Yeah, we're like getting there now and JD is going to show you kind of why that is true. You really need to be sort of in the call it six it'll depend on on the retailer and how much margin they take. But if you're super low cost retailer like an Aldi, you need to be sort of down in five, six cents range. And if you're, if you have a little more margin to play with, it can be a little north of that. So that's sort of if you will a benchmark for grocery but not so for the rest of the retail that I'm referring to. So basically, what you take away from here is we had forex growth in ARR, last year in 2023 versus 2022. And we're projecting to do about two and a half x growth this year to about 10 point 3 million arr. That was a very specific benchmark for us because we felt like we had to get over 10 million in error to do a proper Series C round this is why we're doing an internal BB round is because there's one metric left that we felt we needed to get to and that was total arr. So this gives us a chance to get over that mark over the course of the year and have sort of a stronger basis to have those serious deep conversations. But all in all, all of our other metrics are quite good. Growth rates good. The rule 14 is good. Our internal margins are quite strong now I want to put it out in the 74% gross margin. That is exclusive of hardware. What we tried to do is just give you a sense of what we are and what we will be going forward as a SaaS company. We are definitely a software company and not a hardware company. However, as an asterix there is a one off massive contract that we chose to partake in called The Intuit dome, which is the new Los Angeles Clippers, home stadium that Steve Ballmer is building, it's a $2 billion project. We are the sole provider of technology in that stadium. It's about 40 different stores, concession stands as well as merchandising stores like jerseys as well as their VIP space. So it's a massive deal. And they asked as part of that deal that we be the one throat to choke for things like hardware. So that's 4000 cameras. It's like several 100 gates, it's servers. It's all of that passing through our books. So bear with us when we show you these numbers because that hardware is skewing some things, and that won't be an issue going forward. But it was it was a great deal for us. And by the way, 15 points on about $10 million worth of hardware is not a bad little pickup but that's why you see this orange line doing some funky stuff on the bottom. Long story short, the blended margin is about 42 points. But all in all, we feel really strong about our ability to go charge up in the marketplace we charge about on average 37 cents per item. And our costs are down around eight cents and we'll show you that chart so you don't have to ask me questions but long story short, we feel like we're getting the financial part of this really good and healthy. We just need to put more irons in the fire and speed up the closing of these contracts which is what Carlos was alluding to the slowdown again I apologize I wasn't around when the original pitch was made to Qualcomm I suspect there was some very large numbers thrown out some I was trying to think of the word aspirational numbers. But the reality is, especially grocery retail and C store retail tends not to move that quickly. And so what we did was we started to expand what retail really meant and starting to find new avenues that can move more quickly and what you're seeing is stadiums and arenas are moving a little bit more quickly because it's a perfect use case for him. Steve at Carl's equation, dirt. Hey,

Steve at Carl's equation, dirt. Hey,
S Speaker 35:13so one thing you mentioned was I just missed you said one number you would like to hit or one area before you go rains all air Yep. Totally. Yeah. Right. So and the definition of total AR is is like contract AR is that, like currently you're at about a million. You know, it's
so one thing you mentioned was I just missed you said one number you would like to hit or one area before you go rains all air Yep. Totally. Yeah. Right. So and the definition of total AR is is like contract AR is that, like currently you're at about a million. You know, it's

S Speaker 15:33not it's not contract. It's actual Cashin, right? But do you want to
not it's not contract. It's actual Cashin, right? But do you want to
not it's not contract. It's actual Cashin, right? But do you want to
not it's not contract. It's actual Cashin, right? But do you want to
S Speaker 45:40be like the mass AR Ma, Mr. Robot recurring revenue for that month times 12. So this star needs to be deployed to refer to count on that number. So even though we may have more like right now we have around nine eight to $9 million in contracts AR but a bunch of that has been deploy like within the normal shop as far as our being deployed. So we don't count them as AR sorry, our spar you see in the next one here. It's the city deploying to do a walk this is already contracted AR that we have this federal deployment face. So right now I have like around $8 million in contract AR plus sources on Google deployment end of 2000.

S Speaker 16:26So for example, the end of the dome is in that deployed number that's again, those 40 stores are literally being built as we speak. So those two bars together are a little over 874. That's a job cut. They have some backup back path stores that will open in their normal cycle. And then that really leaves Well where do you get the rest? We have a very robust pipeline of north of 6 million total it says 5.1 But it's since gotten bigger. And we've probability adjusted up back to about 1.8. Certainly isn't go get about 800,000. And that would be new banners to us. So either new stores new stadiums. You get its new banners to us.
So for example, the end of the dome is in that deployed number that's again, those 40 stores are literally being built as we speak. So those two bars together are a little over 874. That's a job cut.

S Speaker 37:11Okay, and then this I assume factor is some I don't know, maybe it does. Maybe it doesn't, but any charms in my experience throughout the year. Yeah,
Okay, and then this I assume factor is some I don't know, maybe it does. Maybe it doesn't, but any charms in my experience throughout the year. Yeah,
Okay, and then this I assume factor is some I don't know, maybe it does. Maybe it doesn't, but any charms in my experience throughout the year. Yeah,
Okay, and then this I assume factor is some I don't know, maybe it does. Maybe it doesn't, but any charms in my experience throughout the year. Yeah,
S Speaker 17:20but we don't honestly have that much churn job because the only one that tends to open and close stores and that's very much in their business model. As a they have about 11,000 stores throughout Poland. They open and close based off of foot traffic, but otherwise we don't have a lot of turn. These are stadium stores, for example. You don't tend to close those once they're open because it's disruptive on their current caps. Yeah, so we have very low churn otherwise, but yeah, jotka would be the only sort of asterik to that. Got it. Okay.
but we don't honestly have that much churn job because the only one that tends to open and close stores and that's very much in their business model.

S Speaker 37:49And then also this understanding of store is there any seasonality factor comes into play? Are they going to pay you regardless? Yeah,
And then also this understanding of store is there any seasonality factor comes into play? Are they going to pay you regardless? Yeah,
And then also this understanding of store is there any seasonality factor comes into play? Are they going to pay you regardless? Yeah,
And then also this understanding of store is there any seasonality factor comes into play? Are they going to pay you regardless? Yeah,
S Speaker 38:58as Steve is just as close to this, as Carl was just a high level for my understanding. So the goal is to get to Tim AR end of this year, right? That's right. And with this race, we don't know exactly how much dollar you're going to bring in right.
as Steve is just as close to this, as Carl was just a high level for my understanding. So the goal is to get to Tim AR end of this year, right? That's right. And with this race, we don't know exactly how much dollar you're going to bring in right.

S Speaker 19:18goal was to get us to the second half or a second quarter of next year, so called June of next year, and we figured that was in the neighborhood of 12 million. So the round was geared towards giving us that amount. Okay. We the round says up to 13.4. I'm sure Carlos has mentioned that the founders have a payout. Yeah, that's roughly 10% of the round if it goes over $10 million. So 13.4 It gets you back to 12. That's how we came up with that

goal was to get us to the second half or a second quarter of next year, so called June of next year, and we figured that was in the neighborhood of 12 million. So the round was geared towards giving us that amount. Okay. We the round says up to 13.4. I'm sure Carlos has mentioned that the founders have a payout. Yeah, that's roughly 10% of the round if it goes over $10 million. So 13.4 It gets you back to 12. That's how we came up with that
S Speaker 39:47guy got it. So basically, the round is designed to get you caught a 12 months ish runway roughly level, right?
guy got it. So basically, the round is designed to get you caught a 12 months ish runway roughly level, right?
guy got it. So basically, the round is designed to get you caught a 12 months ish runway roughly level, right?
guy got it. So basically, the round is designed to get you caught a 12 months ish runway roughly level, right?
S Speaker 19:56That's right. Give us the time to get that 10 million in ARR as well as hold the Series C round. Okay. So you
That's right. Give us the time to get that 10 million in ARR as well as hold the Series C round. Okay. So you
That's right. Give us the time to get that 10 million in ARR as well as hold the Series C round. Okay. So you
That's right. Give us the time to get that 10 million in ARR as well as hold the Series C round. Okay. So you
S Speaker 310:05have to raise probably in the first quarter of next year. Great. Yeah,
have to raise probably in the first quarter of next year. Great. Yeah,
have to raise probably in the first quarter of next year. Great. Yeah,
have to raise probably in the first quarter of next year. Great. Yeah,
S Speaker 110:11I think we probably start at the back half of this year. Oh, back out this year. Okay. Yeah, we'll start we'll start i like it takes a while. Right. So the good news is because of this round, we've already started the conversation. Yeah. Okay, sounds good. Yeah. All right. So Bobby, if you were to fast forward, I just want to show you there are a list of clients and focus areas so you get a sense of where this pipeline is coming for who they are our sort of spread to diversify around travel. Fuel campuses, stadiums, and other ground and go the last piece to that, then you can skip this. The last piece of that is this notion of spatial intelligence. And we did not build this year on any revenue associated with quote unquote spatial intelligence but that's a little bit of a miss nomer as well, because within the Intuit dome, is really our first contractor on spatial intelligence. And that's twofold. One is tracking say Carlos as he moves through the VIP space, because Steve Ballmer wants to make certain that he's having a good time. It's very Minority Report. I'm just going to tell you that right up front, this wasn't our choice. This is what the client wants. And then there's a new new bit of technology they're putting in there called Parallel Reality where you walk up to a giant screen, and if Bobby and I are standing next to each other, we will each be served a different communication. It's pretty cool stuff. Again, very minority reports, but the only way that really works is if you trap people. And so we will be able to charge them for the spatial intelligence that we're doing there. And it has nothing to do with the receipt. Now if you extrapolate that out and this is where JT is gonna go a little bit more in depth we can start to do a lot of stuff around spatial intelligence that has nothing to do with retail per se. Now, some of the clients will be retailers, but it won't be necessarily generating or sheet seeing won't be about cashierless checkout. And that's great. In fact, we have one client called image first, that's an industrial cleaning company. And they're in the midst of signing a contract with us to do safety in their facility. So again, none of those none of that revenue is in this year's number because we understand it's gonna take us a little time to get into those spaces to build up the sales acumen that we're going to have to have in order to grow that business. But it's great as a proof that the market is interested in that. And JD is going to kind of explain to you a little bit more why that makes sense. So let me pause there before we get into the technology but any questions on sort of the pipeline or the commercial side?
I think we probably start at the back half of this year. Oh, back out this year. Okay. Yeah, we'll start we'll start i like it takes a while. Right.

S Speaker 413:16is it gonna be like three times they are so probably where we are today. So probably close near $30 million. They are or next year because we start seeing that pipeline. For the special ed materialize. So then we'll come so if you look the retail will probably double from 10 goes to 20 but we start adding a special AI on it.

S Speaker 213:47last board meeting. We were talking. We needed this to say we need to get the sales muscle at the right before we can talk about this. We don't know how much are. So I'm discounting a lot of those numbers because we're very early in the game. Yeah,

That accounts for 70% prefer our items and groceries 30% of our items. All right, well, their revenue otherwise the groceries only 60% of our revenue while the Grabbin goal is the remaining 84 percentage. Bill How

16:41Verse I mean, great times do you have open God and
S Speaker 716:47don't have going to be on the spot right now? There we go. Okay, you can see this. Yep, yep. All right. So I'll go SSRS so as you as you need it. So please give me some feedback. But I'll start with basically a bit of a look, high, high level view on what we're doing. And this slide I'm essentially showing, again, the key metrics that we show to the board every every board meeting, and that keeps us on track, which is the number of products like Steve said, it's not about numbers. It was about number of products. And that's an important metric we do uptime meaning the amount of time or the inverse of the amount of time a store needs to be down for maintenance or for any issue or any bug or anything that has happened. Accuracy, meaning the amount of correct items that come out in a receipt versus the incorrect items. And then the annotated time reduction is essentially about the human piece. It's the amount of data that gets removed from the human annotation pool while delivering the same quality of results. And then on the bottom just gives you a bit perspective on the number of items that we're doing. We just surpassed 20 million actually, we keep going beyond this is already old. And then we're over 250,000 items sold every week. Just we do we did about 3 million in q1, 2 million items. We're at 99 Point 82% on uptime. That's really encouraging. We keep surrounding the 99% of accuracy delivered to our clients and every quarter we do 20 About 25% reduction in data from whether it's the AI that's better trained or the system that's better performing with the tools that are better. But in general, we're removing 25% from the annotation, which actually reflects itself in the cost reductions that we've been seeing over time. So the first
don't have going to be on the spot right now? There we go. Okay, you can see this. Yep, yep. All right. So I'll go SSRS so as you as you need it. So please give me some feedback.

S Speaker 219:08question that came up, maybe 8.95 Is your current accuracy. That's live human in the loop if you didn't have human in the loop, what would be that number? And I guess, corollary question is
question that came up, maybe 8.95 Is your current accuracy. That's live human in the loop if you didn't have human in the loop, what would be that number? And I guess, corollary question is

question that came up, maybe 8.95 Is your current accuracy. That's live human in the loop if you didn't have human in the loop, what would be that number? And I guess, corollary question is
S Speaker 219:28when do you envision that this cost becomes very, very small, or I know the cost is improving? But the need we do need to have a you may lose the weight forever or?
when do you envision that this cost becomes very, very small, or I know the cost is improving? But the need we do need to have a you may lose the weight forever or?
when do you envision that this cost becomes very, very small, or I know the cost is improving? But the need we do need to have a you may lose the weight forever or?
when do you envision that this cost becomes very, very small, or I know the cost is improving? But the need we do need to have a you may lose the weight forever or?
S Speaker 719:42Yeah, so the question the first the answer, the first question is, it depends on where so if you save in a stadium versus a all the verses group and convenience, but in globally if I do an average across the globe, in terms of what is the accuracy, without a human in the loop, meaning if I decided that I trust my system 100% irrespective of what it says you will be somewhere around 87% 86 to 87%. What that means is that today, in 13% of the cases that we say we don't have confidence, we actually were incorrect. Not only did we not have confidence in our prediction, but we were incorrect in the confidence on the actual prediction. And then a human came in and fix that up to 99%. So I think that answers your first question. The second question is, while those human is human and deliberate, acquired forever, when do we get to God? So the cost I'll talk in a minute, but from the philosophical question Will you ever use him will? You'll always need humans a loop. I will state that for a problem that requires 99% accuracy, with all the freedom of human behavior and no restriction in what you want the shopper to do. Yes, you will always need human loop to provide 9% Now that how much human in the loop is a big, big part of this? We believe that we're actually you said when is this low enough? We believe that were low enough, otherwise we wouldn't be in business. So when do we get to numbers that grow into grocery, for example, is here. So in this slide, is how much we spend on every item. This is normalized by item but in terms of behaviors that we either annotate or spin and compute on the y axis that's the cost per item. And axis is time. So when when you see these colors these represent segments of retail industry. And the segments are rated at how much they are tolerant about accepting our prices. So we can charge 50 cents per product and dangerous because they're really about the experience. We couldn't charge 50 cents to an ally. They just their business wouldn't allow for that. And so as you can see here, as our cost gets better, we start to enter in the segments and be able to provide valuable ROI for them. So obviously the blue one is experienced base into down the red one is captive audiences and as you can see, this is actually our bread and butter is what we expanding with. With travel with stadiums with let Kurland even jockey themselves but outside of Poland, given the price sensitivity or in the cost of the country as well. The green starts to grow into convenience and grocery. So smaller format stores for convenience with focus more increased labor costs. So examples are like Jack like Ireland and some other players in grocery that are not this compressions. And then you yell was more like this going this conversion for free? At at large. This will show in October 23 years where we were at about 16 cents. Six months later, we're now at eight cents. Actually ahead of our prediction. And so that question is, when are we low enough? Well, at eight cents, we are low enough to tackle both blue red and green, which is orange pie and is enough to start to talk to Aldi about expansion with the working out to the future that will come into that. So I'll pause there for a second to make sure that I address the question
Yeah, so the question the first the answer, the first question is, it depends on where so if you save in a stadium versus a all the verses group and convenience, but in globally if I do an average across the globe, in terms of what is the accuracy, without a human in the loop, meaning if I decided that I trust my system 100% irrespective of what it says you will be somewhere around 87% 86 to 87%. What that means is that today, in 13% of the cases that we say we don't have confidence, we actually were incorrect. Not only did we not have confidence in our prediction, but we were incorrect in the confidence on the actual prediction. And then a human came in and fix that up to 99%.

S Speaker 724:49size has an impact on a few things and I in I don't want to I don't want to take minutes away because never in my presence and I find we were over 95% No human need to look at any size of store. Because it's not about the size of store. It's about the behavior would happen with size is that you have more behaviors. So because if you look at my background, there's a there's a the the grocery store here, if you have more people in there, you have more behaviors, you may have kids on scooters going they'll be out and kicking things or touching things, those expands the world of what's possible to happen there. And so that expands the complexity. It's not about the size itself. It's about what people do. And now, it's a fair proxy when you think about a small stadium store where you come in, open the fridge, take two beers and walk away versus when you come in here. Walk through the aisles, pick up fruit, put it back. So there's there's a relationship that it's just not a direct one. Technically, it doesn't matter if it's a 10,000 square foot store. Or if it's a 50,000 square foot store. Because if the behaviors are the same, then the complexity is the same. And I can tell you this, for example, there is a I think it's 3000 square foot space in the Intuit dome that we're actually doing right now. And so that the the accuracy and the challenges don't change.

S Speaker 126:55Let me let me address a question that you guys asked her why is Amazon not in the grocery business minute they are still in the cashierless checkout. They are not in the grocery business because it's really hard to do that, especially with the way that they did it. They're never gonna make money with the way that they chose to solve that problem. So they wisely said, Let's not do that anymore. If you look across the industry, you've got Treecko, Rubondo, zippin and a few others Zevia. I mean, combined, you're talking about maybe a dozen grocery stores, but that doesn't mean that we can't get there before the rest of them and that's what JD is trying to point out to us. We can get to a cost per item point that makes sense for grocery, but Amazon never will. And that's only because of the way they chose to do it with the types of cameras they use the weight sensors and the human in the loop that they have. What JD did and the key point for you to remember is he has AI isn't just about being able to say with a high confidence level that you grabbed a Coca Cola. It's also about when you use these human in the loop, how efficient can you make them and that's really the secret sauce that JD has been using to bring down if there's four questions you have to answer who what, where and how many, we can serve up only the one question that needs to be answered because the system has a high confidence on the other three questions. So you take what say Amazon would take multiple minutes if not the entire shopping journey times two people by the way, to figure out what was happening. JD can serve up 16 seconds worth of video, maybe an eight second increments, and we'd be done with multiple shopping trips or multiple items at very least, with that same person that inside of a minute. That's the secret sauce that he's really created. It's not so much that you have people it's how efficient that you can make them. By the way over the last 11 months. We've literally gotten rid of 50% of our humans in the loop and we're down to about 44 people at any one point in time versus the 1000 that you heard Amazon had I whether it was 1000 or 800 knows a lot more than us right 44
