S Speaker 21:12Absolutely, yeah, it will be my pleasure. So I'm currently working with Qualcomm ventures. I'm a senior associate here, and my personal focus has been on AI agents, the team itself, Qualcom venture team. It's a corporate venture arm of Qualcomm. We have been around for about 25 years. Have about 250 plus active portfolio companies currently, and are more than a billion dollars in asset under management. I'd say our investments broadly follow the Qualcomm's thesis of investing in Compute and connectivity, and under that broader thesis, we have invested a lot in AI infrastructure place. So we are some notable names you would find would be hugging face, anthropic, scale, AI companies like that. And now we are taking a very strong look in the AI agent space and also vertical AI applications for that matter. That's where, that's the focus I'm leading for the company right now, our check sizes are two to ten million we are preferably a Series A investor. Sometimes we do see opportunistically, for that matter, and we have done AI investments, infrastructure more recently, and tooling layer, we plan to do more applications. I'd say we have done IoT investments, computer vision, XR automobile tech stack, robotics, so some spaces that align well with Qualcomm. Okay.

S Speaker 13:11okay, so we are an agent AI platform, and if I get into the tech proper, I've actually been a teaching AI at MIT, MIT Sloan blockchain and decentralized finance and and I came across a lot of issues in the development of AI agents over the years, because I've been doing this for a while, in the last eight years, almost, and prior to Colombia, when I was an escort, but I've always been an entrepreneur with some academic foot in academia, always, yeah, so right now, even a whole faculty question, IIT Madras vit and so on. Now that's

S Speaker 29:35Okay, very quick question here, why? Why do you believe that there is like without blockchain, this cannot be achieved. Why do you think that an API based infrastructure could not do it?

S Speaker 19:46These two are in two different networks. So once they are in two different networks, there has to be trust. And so what we will start to see is there's a lot of guys who build phishing scams, and there'll be a lot of scam bots coming up very soon. So these agents, and you're seeing today, you think, you know, I mean, it's not going to be a world of all good actors. It'll be a great bad actors. And so what happened is, when you talk here, this guy may be a fake guy, or this guy, there'll be someone impersonating this guy. So you're sending information to wrong people. So you'll need and I also have an example where autonomous things, and in Qualcomm's case, you can embed it in devices. We have an example where we have car talking to parking meter, tone booth, fast food and so on, where both are agents. They're not in human form, but they're in machine form. And machine to machine communication. In fact, we filed a patent on bot to bot communication about a few months ago, and in the bottom part communication, there are two layers. The first layer is the authentication, authorization, discovery and so on the handshake layer, I call it now. The handshake layer is common to all any two parties, okay, they can both validate each other. The second layer is more complicated, because when a car talks to a parking meter, is talking about parking when a car talks to fast food, like Wendy's, for example, recently made their drive through into LLM actually, so the Tesla car can actually talk to them, to the Wendy's both will be agents. Now, what happens in that case is, since they're both agents. The card is actually talking about food ordering. Now, not about parking, but food ordering. And then when it goes to toll booth, will talk about toll. So the communication protocol in the second layer is very context driven. The handshake layer is common for all communication. So that is how we set up the patent. Okay, so let me go forward and I'll show you all the components of blockchain, because then you will start to see why you need them. Yeah. So the first part of it is the straightforward part. But even here, a lot of companies don't do you know, all these pieces. So first piece is, we have to train the model. The second piece is we have a testing to test the model, to make sure that the training is accurate and the results coming out of the engine are actually of out of the brain is actually accurate with not actually can go back and fine tune and whatever, yeah. Then the third part is certification. So not, I don't know anyone doing this, but we are the only ones doing this currently, which is we are working with one customer already in the real estate space. So certify means, for example, I cannot just put a sign board and say I'm Raghu Bala real estate or Raghu Bala stockbroker tomorrow, because there are state, federal, local laws that prevent me from doing that. I have to pass those exams. So what happens is, in our case, we actually the brain that we train will pass the exams we feed it with, actually the actual standardized tests. And the real estate company we're working with, there are about 25 different tests that they've given us, some from the SEC, some from FINRA, some from the Real Estate Association and blah, blah, blah. So it has to pass all of the certifications in order to even practice the profession. The company's name is rally.go, R, E, L, L, i.co, okay. Now the third part is the fourth part is flow. So this is similar to what open AI did with the company called Canvas. We actually call it Canvas also. So it's like a canvas. We can drag and drop and create a workflow. And in every company, for example, in here, that's a workflow, very clear workflow that happens here. So those types of flows will be modeled over here. And finally, this part is very relevant to people like Qualcomm, where there is a VM. So what happens is when we deploy we it's Docker eyes and containerized and all that. But it also has a VM. The VM layer will change according to the footprint of the device that is being deployed on. So it could be a small footprint device such as Qualcomm, Snapdragon board, or it could be on a cloud platform, could be Windows, could be Mac, could be a big server and whatnot. So that VM part is very important because it's collecting data and also metering and doing all sorts of things behind the scenes like logging and so on. So we have VMs for different environments and things like that. Okay, now the second part of it is only relevant to this stage four, which is the decentralized so for in order to communicate between organizations, this first three parts are definitely necessary. The first part is a chain where the chain is basically for identity management, for discovery of agents, and also for some communication and so on. Now we are building it as an l2 blockchain. And blockchain, you know, gets a bad name. People get scared of blockchain. They think it's crypto and all that. It's not crypto blockchain. Blockchain, just a network. So the layer two, so it's EVM compatible and things like that. Now that's the chain part of it. The second part of it is every agent will carry a wallet. That wallet is a ERC, 4337, wallet. And every agent is actually a big, giant NFT in our work, it's a ERC 65, one. So what happens is this wallet will contain your identity, will contain currency if you want to pay for things. It will hold any assets that you buy, digital assets and stuff like that. I'll show you some examples coming up. So then after this, this two what happens is, this is a representation on the chain. This is your wallet. Every object will have a wallet and a representation on the chain. Now the third part is, is necessary when you want to connect to certain digital sites like metaverses websites and so on this there's something called wallet Connect, which is open source connection thing for between wallets and any third party metaverses and sites. We have something of agent connect, and I'll show you an example coming up soon. And then final two parts are not necessary, but we have it where you can actually sell the trained models in a marketplace, and that's going to become very relevant, where people want to run the rent agents quickly. So there's a way to put it up for sale or rent, and then there's a way to rent it. Okay, now let's talk about just the market, obviously very big, and our target is $30 million over the next several years, and and that there are two go to market strategies. One is direct sales, and the second is partner led sales. So partner led sales is how we are basically penetrating the market today. We've got about 1300 enterprises that we are we have within our reach. And we have got four partners, two you'll see the example, about five in healthcare and five in financial services. And they give us access to these, these end enterprise customers. And so it's about 1300 and these are these customers, these partners in various these two main domain. That does not mean that we are limited to them, but these two showing a lot of promise. Let's put it that way, yeah. So last week I said Vegas for guide wires, very big in insurance, M bank and Cora, co banking platforms. Optimist is a electronic medical record system. And then these the screen track and cell therapy tools are actually both medical devices, where we have put Jackson nano into and we can easily put Stackdriver, where the actual same brain, but it's quantized and inserted at the edge device. So So for us, whether edge or cloud, doesn't matter, but I think an agent technology is going to see this kind of like, Yeah, we don't care where it runs. It runs on the edge, runs on the cloud. You want to have the flexibility to move things around, and that's going to be very different from SaaS. So SaaS is very server heavy agent is going to be kind of a mixed bag of things, sometimes servers, sometimes client, sometimes here, sometimes there. Okay. Now these are the marketplace where we already have some of these agents built and already ready to use for anyone. And we built these with our banking and healthcare customers. Then these were all like, for example, embank is actually showcasing some of these at the very big show this week in Vegas for money, 2020, so one of the exhibits is almost actually okay, so quick demo, hopefully the sound comes through clearly. This is a very short one, and this more detailed one, yeah, so this is just the interaction part. Let me just get into YouTube to show you.
These two are in two different networks. So once they are in two different networks, there has to be trust. And so what we will start to see is there's a lot of guys who build phishing scams, and there'll be a lot of scam bots coming up very soon.

And finally, this part is very relevant to people like Qualcomm, where there is a VM. So what happens is when we deploy we it's Docker eyes and containerized and all that. But it also has a VM. The VM layer will change according to the footprint of the device that is being deployed on. So it could be a small footprint device such as Qualcomm, Snapdragon board, or it could be on a cloud platform, could be Windows, could be Mac, could be a big server and whatnot. So that VM part is very important because it's collecting data and also metering and doing all sorts of things behind the scenes like logging and so on. So we have VMs for different environments and things like that. Okay, now the second part of it is only relevant to this stage four, which is the decentralized so for in order to communicate between organizations, this first three parts are definitely necessary. The first part is a chain where the chain is basically for identity management, for discovery of agents, and also for some communication and so on. Now we are building it as an l2 blockchain. And blockchain, you know, gets a bad name. People get scared of blockchain. They think it's crypto and all that. It's not crypto blockchain. Blockchain, just a network. So the layer two, so it's EVM compatible and things like that. Now that's the chain part of it. The second part of it is every agent will carry a wallet. That wallet is a ERC, 4337, wallet. And every agent is actually a big, giant NFT in our work, it's a ERC 65, one. So what happens is this wallet will contain your identity, will contain currency if you want to pay for things. It will hold any assets that you buy, digital assets and stuff like that. I'll show you some examples coming up. So then after this, this two what happens is, this is a representation on the chain. This is your wallet. Every object will have a wallet and a representation on the chain. Now the third part is, is necessary when you want to connect to certain digital sites like metaverses websites and so on this there's something called wallet Connect, which is open source connection thing for between wallets and any third party metaverses and sites. We have something of agent connect, and I'll show you an example coming up soon. And then final two parts are not necessary, but we have it where you can actually sell the trained models in a marketplace, and that's going to become very relevant, where people want to run the rent agents quickly. So there's a way to put it up for sale or rent, and then there's a way to rent it. Okay, now let's talk about just the market, obviously very big, and our target is $30 million over the next several years, and and that there are two go to market strategies. One is direct sales, and the second is partner led sales. So partner led sales is how we are basically penetrating the market today. We've got about 1300 enterprises that we are we have within our reach. And we have got four partners, two you'll see the example, about five in healthcare and five in financial services. And they give us access to these, these end enterprise customers. And so it's about 1300 and these are these customers, these partners in various these two main domain. That does not mean that we are limited to them, but these two showing a lot of promise. Let's put it that way, yeah. So last week I said Vegas for guide wires, very big in insurance, M bank and Cora, co banking platforms. Optimist is a electronic medical record system. And then these the screen track and cell therapy tools are actually both medical devices, where we have put Jackson nano into and we can easily put Stackdriver, where the actual same brain, but it's quantized and inserted at the edge device. So So for us, whether edge or cloud, doesn't matter, but I think an agent technology is going to see this kind of like, Yeah, we don't care where it runs. It runs on the edge, runs on the cloud. You want to have the flexibility to move things around, and that's going to be very different from SaaS. So SaaS is very server heavy agent is going to be kind of a mixed bag of things, sometimes servers, sometimes client, sometimes here, sometimes there. Okay. Now these are the marketplace where we already have some of these agents built and already ready to use for anyone. And we built these with our banking and healthcare customers. Then these were all like, for example, embank is actually showcasing some of these at the very big show this week in Vegas for money, 2020, so one of the exhibits is almost actually okay, so quick demo, hopefully the sound comes through clearly. This is a very short one, and this more detailed one, yeah, so this is just the interaction part. Let me just get into YouTube to show you.
These two are in two different networks. So once they are in two different networks, there has to be trust. And so what we will start to see is there's a lot of guys who build phishing scams, and there'll be a lot of scam bots coming up very soon. So these agents, and you're seeing today, you think, you know, I mean, it's not going to be a world of all good actors. It'll be a great bad actors. And so what happened is, when you talk here, this guy may be a fake guy, or this guy, there'll be someone impersonating this guy. So you're sending information to wrong people. So you'll need and I also have an example where autonomous things, and in Qualcomm's case, you can embed it in devices. We have an example where we have car talking to parking meter, tone booth, fast food and so on, where both are agents. They're not in human form, but they're in machine form. And machine to machine communication. In fact, we filed a patent on bot to bot communication about a few months ago, and in the bottom part communication, there are two layers. The first layer is the authentication, authorization, discovery and so on the handshake layer, I call it now. The handshake layer is common to all any two parties, okay, they can both validate each other. The second layer is more complicated, because when a car talks to a parking meter, is talking about parking when a car talks to fast food, like Wendy's, for example, recently made their drive through into LLM actually, so the Tesla car can actually talk to them, to the Wendy's both will be agents. Now, what happens in that case is, since they're both agents. The card is actually talking about food ordering. Now, not about parking, but food ordering. And then when it goes to toll booth, will talk about toll. So the communication protocol in the second layer is very context driven. The handshake layer is common for all communication. So that is how we set up the patent. Okay, so let me go forward and I'll show you all the components of blockchain, because then you will start to see why you need them. Yeah. So the first part of it is the straightforward part. But even here, a lot of companies don't do you know, all these pieces. So first piece is, we have to train the model. The second piece is we have a testing to test the model, to make sure that the training is accurate and the results coming out of the engine are actually of out of the brain is actually accurate with not actually can go back and fine tune and whatever, yeah. Then the third part is certification. So not, I don't know anyone doing this, but we are the only ones doing this currently, which is we are working with one customer already in the real estate space. So certify means, for example, I cannot just put a sign board and say I'm Raghu Bala real estate or Raghu Bala stockbroker tomorrow, because there are state, federal, local laws that prevent me from doing that. I have to pass those exams. So what happens is, in our case, we actually the brain that we train will pass the exams we feed it with, actually the actual standardized tests. And the real estate company we're working with, there are about 25 different tests that they've given us, some from the SEC, some from FINRA, some from the Real Estate Association and blah, blah, blah. So it has to pass all of the certifications in order to even practice the profession. The company's name is rally.go, R, E, L, L, i.co, okay. Now the third part is the fourth part is flow. So this is similar to what open AI did with the company called Canvas. We actually call it Canvas also. So it's like a canvas. We can drag and drop and create a workflow. And in every company, for example, in here, that's a workflow, very clear workflow that happens here. So those types of flows will be modeled over here. And finally, this part is very relevant to people like Qualcomm, where there is a VM. So what happens is when we deploy we it's Docker eyes and containerized and all that. But it also has a VM.

If it's not giving accurate responses, that means the information that it has is inaccurate or not fine tuned in any way. Now we can, we are planning to add a few more things. Like, we can not only detect input, point input and all things and also like, what do you say testing these third party tools that it's falling into? So, for example, if it's retraining something from a enterprise system and answers coming back. I

S Speaker 124:48So what we're doing is for all the tools that you saw earlier. So what we're doing is we are now doing a Community Edition for all developers to use them. So the community edition will be like a limited edition that can do certain things. And then I was a CTO for many, many years. And the problem is developers and CTOs like to build everything in house. They don't like to use tools. I'm telling you as a guy on the other side, on the enterprise side. So by giving a community addition, what we actually start to engage the developers and get their familiarity and so on. Once they get familiar, when we sell itself on the top in the enterprise space, then the developers and the CTO won't pose a barrier, because we have people already using these tools as a level of familiarity. And there's also a reason why we started learning certain things, because what happens is Lang chain, for example, is the 100,000 enterprises already signed up. So we can say, if you use Lang chain, for Lang chain, very low level framework, connect to different llms And so that you don't need to create an API. But you can see if you plan change. We can use Line train or line test, very simple, so we can really get those large volumes of customers onboard. Now the second thing is, when we go sell, obviously, from all the three users, there will be a certain percentage, maybe 2% 5% that convert into paying customers at the enterprise level. So the thing is, for the give the developers a taste and engage them, so that when we go to sell, it becomes a much easier sale. And I think that's a formula that tends to work. Well,

I guess where, where we are quite excited about is the agent to agent communication. I guess you have built an authentication, identification, payments network there, which I certainly believe would be the need of the future. I see you're raising a 2 million round, and there is already some commitments in there. So how much of allocation is left in there? 1.8
