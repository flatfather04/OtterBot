S Speaker 27:21yeah, so you can, right? So we do this, we use our ideation engine, actually, to create a viral ads idea for co conventures. And because, you know, you are also the owner of it, you know, like, when something you want to promote your own business, right? Like the, like, we believe, you know, like the AI, not only need to make it viral, but also understand what is the true value, you know, behind the coconut, right? So, you know, like, what this as Toad is, you know, like, Qualcomm, will, you know, explore, or any, any, you know, really innovation ideas, no matter it's ape or it's just human being, right? So that we believe is a culture, you know, behind, or we will see the solution behind the business and the product, and that is what, you know, creating is, you know, creating the ads idea for those small business so the thing is, you see, like, you know, in today's world, like different companies, I will see, or different groups of people, they have, you know, pain points for that creation, but they have different solution for the enterprise. They just normally, you know, throw a lot of money to the agency, right? Like, like, 30 million per year. Just have great ideas, but it's too expensive, right? And then for a lot of small business, like, there are 40 million centers on the E commerce, like Amazon, Shopify et ce Bay, like they actually have shortage for the ideation, because, you know, like, sometimes they find influencer for the idea, sometimes they have their in house marketing team, because they do not have enough money for the agency, right? But the problem is, so for the influencer marketing, it's actually taking more time, like two weeks or three weeks for the contract and back and forth for the idea. And also for in house marketing team, it's pretty hard for them to actually come up with very ideas. So we will see for a lot of small that, you know, like E commerce people, the ideation is always on shortage. And also we will see, you know, lower down is for all the influencers, right? They are on the social media. It's even harder because, you know, like, they also need to attract traffic followers. But when they have no idea, right? They are just basically stuck. So that's a reason, you know why? Why creating needs? You working on the ideation engine for all those people and

Sorry,
S Speaker 417:35on this one? Yes, first of all, congratulations. I mean, this is amazing. Thank you. I uh, thank you. And so on this one. So the chart here shows on the y axis, annual revenue, and then this is annual so I just want to understand it. Do you have a recurrent revenue model, or do you have mostly like people are paying for you for per ad or per group of ads. And it's not necessarily recurring, which is fine, but
on this one? Yes, first of all, congratulations. I mean, this is amazing. Thank you. I uh, thank you. And so on this one.

S Speaker 218:11per ad, yeah, so actually people are all paying subscription, so it's recurring revenue. The only reason that you can see is, you know, for the AR, we actually have over 8 million AR, but for the annualized revenue, we have 12 million. Is because in our cash revenue, it's over, it's 1.1 million. Some of them are annual package. So it's like a year annualized subscription. So what we do is we, for those annualized subscriptions, we will divide them by 12 when we, you know, calculate the AR, that's the reason. But we never have, you know, per ad like spend, basically, it's mainly just all from the subscription revenue.
per ad, yeah, so actually people are all paying subscription, so it's recurring revenue. The only reason that you can see is, you know, for the AR, we actually have over 8 million AR, but for the annualized revenue, we have 12 million. Is because in our cash revenue, it's over, it's 1.1 million. Some of them are annual package. So it's like a year annualized subscription.

S Speaker 219:07yeah, so here. So we actually have, you know, like, annually subscription, and we have weekly subscription. So for our weekly subscription, we have 68 like, 68% on over one year. And for annual subscription, we have 63% over one year for the retention. But the thing is, the reason, like you said, is because there are some influencers, you know, together with the SMB, right in the E commerce in that. But when we separate out those, you know, influencers, and only look at those e commerce people, we will get 84%
yeah, so here. So we actually have, you know, like, annually subscription, and we have weekly subscription. So for our weekly subscription, we have 68 like, 68% on over one year.

yeah, yeah, this is actually still pretty good retention. I mean, yeah, one year in, right? When did you launch the product.
yeah, yeah, this is actually still pretty good retention. I mean, yeah, one year in, right? When did you launch the product.
yeah, yeah, this is actually still pretty good retention. I mean, yeah, one year in, right? When did you launch the product.
S Speaker 220:01We launched it in 2024, May. So it's like 14 months
We launched it in 2024, May. So it's like 14 months
We launched it in 2024, May. So it's like 14 months
We launched it in 2024, May. So it's like 14 months
S Speaker 220:13ago, sure. So, you know, like, like we said, Right? Ideation sounds like very big, very hard thing. So what we see this, we were actually, you know, building this ideation engine from l1 to l4 like step by step. And today really is in l2 so when we see, you know, like when you look at l3 or Hicks, field or runway, we believe, like for the ads, they're still in level one, right? So when you are in level one, you are just creating some visually appealing but short, disconnected fleets. You never tell people the reason why you need to buy the product. What is the pain point solving? What is the solution it provides? So, you know, like people just get hooked, but then they do not have a real reason why I need to buy this product. And, you know, for pretty we're on level two, right? So in level two, basically you need your ideation om to understand the product. The pain point behind it was a solution. Then it will basically customize, you know, like a story, right for this product, and then, based on the story, it will have different segments things, and then generate the same for each one. And then finally, you know, have a coherent story for the product. So in this case, basically you understand, okay, what is a use case? What is a pinpoint why I need to use this product? And all those, you know, like story we're telling people, okay, how? Why, why you need to make the purchase. And in this level two, you know, still we need some humane loop, right? Because, you know, still, like AI, is not good enough to have, you know, its own ideation capability. But you know, in level three, which we think it's next one, actually, when we give it enough, you know, viral ideas, and also, if we give it enough feedback data from the apps, it will understand what is a good idea, and it will be able to proactively do its ideation on its own. And in that way, we think it's able to generate more emotionally personal and understand the brand culture, you know, not just about the product. For example, if I am going to have an ass for iPhone, I will not just hold the iPhone. Tell you why you need to buy it. I need to understand, Oh, it's so fast, right? So maybe this as doesn't have any iPhone in the ads, you still understand why I need to buy iPhone. So that is, you know, like, what we think will be, you know, really happening in the future, but in today's l2 like we said, we still need humane loop. And this is our the ideation engine. There are three important parts. There is influencer, which is, you know, like the talented human being who will contribute viral ideas, and they will contribute those ideas and input this to this ideation om for the training, and also there will be SMB, or we'll see the business side. And you know, when this like new e commerce owner, they coming, they give it a URL, let's say a product URL. Then what this ai do it is that it will, based on that product information, it will generate a customized, customized ideas based on, you know, the influencers, original viral ideas, and generate the content for this business to run his ads. And after that, it will use API, you know, to pull down the click through rate from the ads manager and feedback to this ideation Aom to do the training. So we believe, using this closed loop feedback and actually this ideational will be, you know, transition from level two to level three, whereas, you know, in the future, it won't need a human being to include viral ideas.
ago, sure. So, you know, like, like we said, Right? Ideation sounds like very big, very hard thing.

S Speaker 224:03yeah, so we train it. So it's not an open source model. We actually train, you know, our main you can think about is as a refined model, just for just using all the apps, feedback, data. And then this

got it. And then for the video, which models are you using for video?
S Speaker 224:50So for video, actually, we are able to use, you know, many different base model, but we have our own small model built on that, because, you know, when we are working with, you know, all the E commerce owners, one thing that we found pretty hard for all those base model is they cannot have the consistency in the products for all the generated videos. So for example, for this table, Bluetooth speaker, we try the Higgs field. It becomes super small and flat. We try the pride. It becomes different color. We try the build three. It becomes super thick and have some extra stuff, I don't know why. And we try the clean and we try, like runway, like none of them actually able to really have the consistency, you know, for the product. So that's a reason we built our own small model on top of, you know, like base model, but we're able to, you know, change any base model underlying it. I will show you our results so you can get the consistency.

S Speaker 226:26so you can see that our consistency is much better, you know, the other models and that because we have, you know, like a lot of data in the in the e Commerce Industry, and we are able to use that To, you know, train our model. And the hardest thing actually, in the consistency is for fashion industry. Because, you know, for fashion industry, very hard for the video model to understand how the clothes will fit out the human being's body. And each clothes is different, right? You know, like they are not standardized product. They're like, each clothes is quite different, and you need to understand, you know, like, you know, when the people is walking right, there is different material of the dress, how it will how it will flow, right? That one is also, you know, important for the eye to understand. And also, you know, the work with some beauty products. It's very hard for the original video model to keep the text exactly the same and keep it very stable. We tried like pika. We tried, you know, like three and sometimes it always have the text like different from what it really is. So that's the reason we build our own. Yeah,
so you can see that our consistency is much better, you know, the other models and that because we have, you know, like a lot of data in the in the e Commerce Industry, and we are able to use that To, you know, train our model.

S Speaker 427:45yeah. And then how do you like, so this small model that you're building that's like, what's the special sauce for consistency? And, you know, all the like, I guess the video models themselves are getting better, and that's fine. But then right now, how are you able to achieve this?
yeah. And then how do you like, so this small model that you're building that's like, what's the special sauce for consistency? And, you know, all the like, I guess the video models themselves are getting better, and that's fine. But then right now, how are you able to achieve this?

S Speaker 228:06Yeah, yeah. So the key actually, is that what we build there is a specialized you can think about, is more like a tokenizer. So what it able to do is that when people input the product image, that tokenizer, so because we understand what characteristics and features people care more about the product, right? So basically, those tokenizer are able to better conserve, you know, or reserve the characteristics that people care more about, like the logo, material, shapes, things like that. So when it able to do that, it will output a token into the Aom, and during the inference stage, basically it's able to, you know better, to recover those characteristics of a product. And that's how we keep the consistency.
Yeah, yeah. So the key actually, is that what we build there is a specialized you can think about, is more like a tokenizer.

S Speaker 429:39yes. And so you, yeah, I guess. So that's one second from a team perspective. What's the team composition today? And third, funding wise, it sounds like you haven't raised yet. Otherwise, why haven't you raised and are you raising them? Those are the three topics.
yes. And so you, yeah, I guess. So that's one second from a team perspective. What's the team composition today? And third, funding wise, it sounds like you haven't raised yet. Otherwise, why haven't you raised and are you raising them? Those are the three topics.
yes. And so you, yeah, I guess. So that's one second from a team perspective. What's the team composition today? And third, funding wise, it sounds like you haven't raised yet. Otherwise, why haven't you raised and are you raising them? Those are the three topics.
yes. And so you, yeah, I guess. So that's one second from a team perspective. What's the team composition today? And third, funding wise, it sounds like you haven't raised yet. Otherwise, why haven't you raised and are you raising them? Those are the three topics.
S Speaker 229:57Yeah, sure. Let me show you the first one, because I think you definitely understand like icon prettify, or things like that. What I will see is, you know, like all those things are more like I will see video Gen or they are more like, you know, like a generator for us and many of them, including like prettify, they are doing more like, we call them talking head or like digital twin technology, right? So basically, what they do is they generate an avatar, and the avatar just talk, right? And then behind her, there's, you know, like, they use original material from the business, and to do you know the content. So I will see why we view them as more like a video generator. Because I think people will face exactly the same issue when they go to runway or video three, is they still do not know what idea right, like, what content I want to create. So I will see like pretty is more like an entry point for most of E commerce and the business owners, because, let's say, maybe two Charlotte today, you want to create an ad for CO ventures, and now you need to use, I don't know, like printify or icon or runway. The first thing you need to think about is, okay, how do I, you know, edit my script, how? What content, what ads I need to do, right? So I will show you, you know, like one of our very interesting storyline, because I don't have enough time, so I'll just show it very quickly. So one of the ads ideation process, you know, we create for the eof the foundation. So what they do is, after the user. They only have the URL. You know, when you are a business owner. You have too many things in your head. Only thing you know is about your product. So we do not need you to do the any ideation. You just need to give me, like your product URL. Then what we do is we analyze the product, we understand the product description. And then you can see is the AI actually generate a very fun, as you know idea for that foundation. So what I do is basically this story tells a gorilla, and the gorilla actually found himself the skin is not, you know, pretty nice, right? So he uses foundation product, and finally, he loved it, and he actually promoted in the jungle, become the influencer of great gorilla, right? Like, this is a very fun idea. So after that is gender, like, you know, selected, we will generate, you know, like, for different scene for this gorilla to understand, you know, like, it will first generate the, you know, different, same image, and after that, it will generate, you know, the videos based on that. So
Yeah, sure. Let me show you the first one, because I think you definitely understand like icon prettify, or things like that. What I will see is, you know, like all those things are more like I will see video Gen or they are more like, you know, like a generator for us and many of them, including like prettify, they are doing more like, we call them talking head or like digital twin technology, right?

33:24and what into this?
S Speaker 233:28Yeah, so to be honest, I will see, you know, like I actually contribute like this to more to my team. Because, you know, my team actually, they are really talented, people working at Adobe, people working at, you know, like Aurora, or things like that. And they are actually, I will see AI wise. I rely on Charlie and Zhu, a who is doing, actually more like AI research. They are actually, you know, the first like Charlie, the first person who is doing the person image generation in the whole research world. And, like, actually, he is actually, you know, like the author of all the dataset for the face and pertinent, you know, for all the generation AI right now. So he is pretty famous in the industry. And also I will see for marketing wise, like, you know, also because of my team, like Zara and Miranda, they're actually pretty strong. I will see like, they actually, like, Zara, actually, she actually have a campaign that on a Twitter that have over 10 million views in three days on Twitter before. So, like, I think, like, my team,

34:37what's her name?
S Speaker 234:39Yeah. Like, I will send you that, that tweet, so you will get it, but, but the thing is, like, I think the key there, you asked me. The thing is, you know, as a founder, I am a typical person who is really focused on Instagram and Tiktok. I spend more than five to six hours, you know, like, per day on those social media. So I know, you know, I think in the future, people's brain are changed, to be honest. You know, if you are not, if all the brands, they are not all in those engaging content, people's attention will be super short, right? The attention span will be super short, and you cannot engage them. You cannot convey the information. So what we see there is, you know, like as a person. I believe I can only watch those really engaging and viral apps in the future. And that's what I want to build.
Yeah. Like, I will send you that, that tweet, so you will get it, but, but the thing is, like, I think the key there, you asked me.

Okay, so I guess you.
Okay, so I guess you.
Okay, so I guess you.
S Speaker 437:29is only way to solve that. So Ellen then, funding wise, why, like, why didn't you raise money?
is only way to solve that. So Ellen then, funding wise, why, like, why didn't you raise money?
is only way to solve that. So Ellen then, funding wise, why, like, why didn't you raise money?
is only way to solve that. So Ellen then, funding wise, why, like, why didn't you raise money?
S Speaker 237:40Oh, actually, I raised two rounds before. So yeah, maybe I haven't, like expressed clear with Priyesh before. We actually raised two rounds before. Our first round actually is in 2021 and we raised 2 million, and valuation of 10 mil at that round. And for our second round, actually, it's in 20, like end of 2022. That round, we actually raised 5 million and valuation of 50 mil. And for this, yeah, we are raising like eight to 10 million with valuation 80 to 100 mil. Got it
Oh, actually, I raised two rounds before. So yeah, maybe I haven't, like expressed clear with Priyesh before. We actually raised two rounds before.

S Speaker 438:18so you you have, right? And then who are the investors?
so you you have, right? And then who are the investors?
so you you have, right? And then who are the investors?
so you you have, right? And then who are the investors?
S Speaker 238:22Yeah, so our first round, you know, hence, like we are, our investor is from notable and inform, and the second round, our investor is from Hill House. And for this round, we already have, I think, Priyesh mentioned, like, we already have term sheet and but we have several term sheet we, I will say 80% we mean we may already know will be the lead, but still waiting for several more offers, but likely we want to close, you know, like in in August, so we're trying to finalize the architecture, maybe to see next
Yeah, so our first round, you know, hence, like we are, our investor is from notable and inform, and the second round, our investor is from Hill House. And for this round, we already have, I think, Priyesh mentioned, like, we already have term sheet and but we have several term sheet we, I will say 80% we mean we may already know will be the lead, but still waiting for several more offers, but likely we want to close, you know, like in in August, so we're trying to finalize the architecture, maybe to see next

S Speaker 439:03week. Yeah, okay, so then

39:09would love to engage.
would love to engage.
would love to engage.
would love to engage.
S Speaker 439:12There's probably many things that we can do around, we can talk about more around what we can do together the two companies, like, there's ideas around that we can work on, on device for mobile. We can device for AI PCs take you to market. There's several ways that we can collaborate, and I think our teams would be excited to work with you. The one thing that I would say is, you know, our process typically takes about five to six weeks from an investment perspective. So with is that timeline? Okay with you?
There's probably many things that we can do around, we can talk about more around what we can do together the two companies, like, there's ideas around that we can work on, on device for mobile.

The one thing that I would say is, you know, our process typically takes about five to six weeks from an investment perspective. So with is that timeline? Okay with you?
S Speaker 239:51So I get a question, Is that five to six weeks is for, you know, like, you know, money sent to the back or is it like just for a term sheet.
So I get a question, Is that five to six weeks is for, you know, like, you know, money sent to the back or is it like just for a term sheet.
So I get a question, Is that five to six weeks is for, you know, like, you know, money sent to the back or is it like just for a term sheet.
So I get a question, Is that five to six weeks is for, you know, like, you know, money sent to the back or is it like just for a term sheet.
S Speaker 440:01See, we're not gonna, I think you already have enough term sheets. We're not gonna give you a term sheet now, right? Or do you want us to? If you want us to give a term sheet, then it'll take us like five to six weeks to get there to give you a term sheet. So, but if you already have term sheets, my guess is you're not gonna wait five to six weeks for us. So the only question at that time, at that point would be, would you be willing to work with us to actually
See, we're not gonna, I think you already have enough term sheets. We're not gonna give you a term sheet now, right? Or do you want us to? If you want us to give a term sheet, then it'll take us like five to six weeks to get there to give you a term sheet. So, but if you already have term sheets, my guess is you're not gonna wait five to six weeks for us. So the only question at that time, at that point would be, would you be willing to work with us to actually
See, we're not gonna, I think you already have enough term sheets. We're not gonna give you a term sheet now, right? Or do you want us to?

So, but if you already have term sheets, my guess is you're not gonna wait five to six weeks for us. So the only question at that time, at that point would be, would you be willing to work with us to actually

become a coin master,
S Speaker 440:35if we, you know, like, in like, what we can tell you is, like, within two weeks, we can tell you, like, are we continue? Are we interested in continuing to push this forward in our process? Right? But a final decision, and then from final decision to really wiring the money? It's not much time, really. It's mostly like the final decision will be, will take around five or six weeks, is that something that you're okay to work with, if you are then then, I guess then we can. We can. We'd love to actually continue to spend time is interesting enough and work

S Speaker 241:22with work, honestly, so I get a quick question. So for the five to six week is like, you know, get the decision, but like, you need to either lead investor to wait for that time too, because they probably well, if that, because, to be honest, you
with work, honestly, so I get a quick question. So for the five to six week is like, you know, get the decision, but like, you need to either lead investor to wait for that time too, because they probably well, if that, because, to be honest, you

41:41can do it first, the first close, you can do a

S Speaker 441:44second. So we don't need the investors away. The only thing is, if you want us to come in, then it will take us. So what you'll have to do so, so I'll tell you what you'd have to do. So you'll have to do is, you'll have to I mean, essentially, if you have enough people to fill in the round, and then let's say you say, You know what, I want to wait for Qualcomm ventures decision, and you want to prior, you got priority of investors, right? Like, I want this person first, I want this person second, third, fourth. Qualcomm ventures somewhere lies, you know it's, let's say it's in their top priorities. And if it's if that's the case, then what you do is you get, let other require other investors that are lower priority than us, have them wait, and then wait for our decision. And if, let's say, for any reason, we say, hey, we can't invest, then you let the others come. But if you come in, then you let others know that, hey, sorry for this wrong. So that's typically how it would work. But a lead investor, you close with a lead investor. If you want to close with the lead investor in, let's say, in three weeks, four weeks, then you go ahead and close it with the lead investor, and you leave the round open for X amount of dollars. So in two weeks, we can tell you that, you know, this is the minimum that we would want, and we would we can be in a position assuming our process goes forward to close by this day. So, so that's the, you know, that's the little bit of a gymnastics so my to you is, you can think about it. You don't have to answer now, which is, Would you be open to that? If you're open to that, then, you know, we'd love to engage further.

S Speaker 243:36I see, I see, yeah, I will see. The thing is, like, to be honest, like, I really like the on age computing. There's a reason. I told Priyesh Before I like, we have lot of, you know, mobile users as well. We think the on age computing is really the future of AI as well. That's, I think, the key reason. But I do have a quick question. I think that also depends on the roughly text size. So, because Priyesh told me it's like, I think we haven't had that discussion yet, so I'm wondering, like, what will be the rough check size? If, like, for this round possibly
I see, I see, yeah, I will see. The thing is, like, to be honest, like, I really like the on age computing. There's a reason.

S Speaker 444:13happen the minimum that we would have to get here? See, we typically aim at this stage of the company. We typically aim for 5% ownership, 5% okay, so as or as close as we can get to a 5% ownership, like four to 5% so that's typically what our target is. And so I'd say, you know, like a minimum of 3.5 and
happen the minimum that we would have to get here? See, we typically aim at this stage of the company. We typically aim for 5% ownership, 5% okay, so as or as close as we can get to a 5% ownership, like four to 5% so that's typically what our target is.

44:51that would be our ask.

Yeah. Okay. Thank you, Tushar. So nice to meet you.
Yeah. Okay. Thank you, Tushar. So nice to meet you.
S Speaker 246:31yeah. So, like Tushar mentioned, he said there will be like five to six weeks, you know, for like more, like a final decision, right? So, you know, during this five to six weeks, he said, like, basically, like, two weeks, roughly, you know, whether you want to continue, then another, you know, three, four weeks, right? So, I just curious about the rough process, like, what process will be included in those time? He mentioned some of it, like, you know, be it person, blah, blah, blah, but
yeah. So, like Tushar mentioned, he said there will be like five to six weeks, you know, for like more, like a final decision, right? So, you know, during this five to six weeks, he said, like, basically, like, two weeks, roughly, you know, whether you want to continue, then another, you know, three, four weeks, right?

47:03do you have a rough, like,
do you have a rough, like,
do you have a rough, like,
do you have a rough, like,
S Speaker 248:47see, I see, so after the decision is made, you know, like, what will be the process after that? Because I feel like he said it's like five to six for a decision, but then, you know, take some time to wire the money,
see, I see, so after the decision is made, you know, like, what will be the process after that? Because I feel like he said it's like five to six for a decision, but then, you know, take some time to wire the money,

S Speaker 149:02no, five to six. I think that was a little bit confusing. Five to six weeks we will be able to wire the money. The decision, from the decision to sort of taking another couple of weeks is internal processes that we have to do. So it's like we will then create a memo, send it to our IC team, keep the CFO of Qualcomm involved in this case. Keep the CMO of Qualcomm just in loop that we are doing this investment. This is how we are thinking about it. Keep the legal there will be a legal compliance check. So they will check if everything falls in place, things like that. So those are more compliance things that we have to do internally. On our end, we would not require your inputs for those couple of weeks, but then the decision from the ventures team would be made earlier.
no, five to six. I think that was a little bit confusing. Five to six weeks we will be able to wire the money.

I also need to meet with the mobile team and the PC team to get more like regular regulatory
I also need to meet with the mobile team and the PC team to get more like regular regulatory
S Speaker 149:57or not really. So the mobile and PC teams is something that we would like to do in order to show you our collaboration efforts. So with the mobile team, we would like to sort of get you face to face with the leaders of our mobile business units. They will have a discussion, and they can, you can, in that place, discuss on how a creative Qualcomm collaboration could look like similarly, with the PC team, and these teams also have a lot of ongoing GTM efforts and things like that. So they will be able to tell you on how their programs are running things like that. But that is not really a part of our process, per se. That's more of for us to sort of also show that we are a strategic investor and we will bring value to the table. I
or not really. So the mobile and PC teams is something that we would like to do in order to show you our collaboration efforts.

That's more of for us to sort of also show that we are a strategic investor and we will bring value to the table. I
S Speaker 151:19then we can discuss. That sounds great. That makes sense. I think you can go ahead and sort of sign the lead term sheet. That would be also that that would make the most sense for you as well. And we can come in for the second closing. Parallely, I will just start the discussions with our business units. Parallely, so that will be, keep like, if you have scheduled for that, that would be good discussions to have in parallel with everything else that we are discussing with the ventures team. So you can, you can discuss about collaborations, things like that, in parallel. And I'll set send an email loop you in with so who leads those efforts on our end, and you can have those discussions, and then, with setup, will loop in with Tushar set up something for an in person meeting sometime next week. Okay,
then we can discuss. That sounds great. That makes sense. I think you can go ahead and sort of sign the lead term sheet. That would be also that that would make the most sense for you as well.
