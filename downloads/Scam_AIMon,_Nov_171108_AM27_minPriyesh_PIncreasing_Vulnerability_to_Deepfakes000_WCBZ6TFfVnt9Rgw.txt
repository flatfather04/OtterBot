S Speaker 23:43And Neil when, when you explain the product, how do you expose it to your customers? Like, does this become an integration to some of their existing applications? How are some of the customers using it? I just want to understand, how does this technology become a product and a platform for you? And how are you how the customers using it today? No, yeah, this

S Speaker 14:03is a really, really good question, I think, like right now what we're like KYC, the customers that we're kind of targeting are people that need to know, hey, we put this image through. Is this a deep fake or not? And so that's why it's mostly done through API calls. A lot of our customers are KYC ID vendors. Think about people that scan your ID, like, you take a picture ID, that you do a selfie. A lot of those, it's like, they want to put that image of, like, the picture of the ID and the picture of the selfie through an API, and it will tell you, hey, there's a deep layer of this. Yeah. Or during remote interviews, it's like, when you're live on, like, a zoom call there, we want to know is like, Hey, is the person that we're interviewing right now, someone that's being defect,

S Speaker 25:44Got it correct. That's super interesting. And that that kind of a demo, I'm sure would, would be so interesting to see guys, but it was really, it's

S Speaker 15:53really funny. I think we ended over 140 investor meetings. Yeah, it's like, no one has been able to figure it out. That's like we deep baked into the meeting. It's a look after each other.

S Speaker 26:03That's, that's, that's a great way to demo the product, I must say, super, super interesting. So from from what I'm understanding, the modalities you support today are picture, voice and even text, if I'm not wrong,

S Speaker 36:17so far, we're really focusing our image and voice a little bit like SLM on the text, but we are more focusing on the product that we can sell to our customer right now, because we are small keep so we try to focusing doing one to two thing really good, instead of doing everything good.

7:36start. Totally makes sense. Yes,
start. Totally makes sense. Yes,
start. Totally makes sense. Yes,
start. Totally makes sense. Yes,
S Speaker 17:40um, we can keep going. This is kind of our model performance right now, kind of comparatively to our competitors. We can see that this is we have a reality defender that raised over like 52 million, yeah, high and raised over 100 million. Again, they're a billion dollar value company, AR and obviously one of the small ones that are coming up. But it's like we can see that the Accuracy for these people are a lot lower than like they're expected. It's again, it comes down to those three reasons. Again, it's like humans can't tell anymore. The evolutionary rate in how traditional security isn't ready. We're finding that they're not moving fast enough in this space. Well, we're kind of have our entire methodology changed through this lens. Yeah.
um, we can keep going. This is kind of our model performance right now, kind of comparatively to our competitors.

S Speaker 18:30we're still kind of working on, like, kind of the research. We would have kind of put it all together. But we do want to publish a public data set that we're like, what we kind of tested on. Of course, it's like, the big reason why we can kind of say this accuracy, and how, the reason why we can kind of go through more a bit of our model is actually that here, maybe I can skip ahead. Is that because of this? Is that a big reason why we're so we're so much better than our competitors, is that we have a synthetic that data flow we are able to kind of kind of, as you can see on the left, this is kind of like what the Open Data Sets look like. A lot of the academic sources for data sets, as well as like open source you can say data sets for these deep fakes are low quality and they're outdated their data like five, four years ago when deepaks were a lot easier to kind of measure out. And we're saying, seeing that a lot of our competitors are using this open data set to benchmark their products, and we're finding is like, hey, this thing is way too outdated. These don't really reflect nowadays, what these attacks are doing nowadays, right? They're just really good markers to say that you have a really high accuracy Well, our proprietary, like synthetic data set, the things that we're kind of working on, where it's like, we have an agentic workflow to make sure we can script data off the web to see what is the latest and greatest deepfakes. And the things that we can kind of see, they see all the four pictures on the records of our deepfakes that our model was like, trained on. These are the things that we're looking at trying to make sure that we're preventing and we're making sure other people can impersonate

S Speaker 29:57got it and Neil, this is super interesting. You mentioned one. You have your own synthetic dataset, data generation engine. What models are you using to sort of generate datasets? You also mentioned an agent, tech scrape, web scraping, trying to find the right data, deep fakes, and using that as your training data. Is that the secret sauce, and if so, do you see a long tail problem where, say, down the line you have 1000s of video AI models generating different kind of content, and you have to sort of generate data sets out of each of these models to be accurate enough. Is that how the market would evolve?

S Speaker 110:39I think I think we'll take this, like one step at a time. There's like separate things, but I guess to the first point is, is this our secret sauce? I think mostly Yes. Is like the ability to evolve, to collect data, to make sure that we're we have, like, the most up to date data a week or two weeks before that, when a new model releases, is kind of what we're aiming for. What we're finding is that a lot of the ability to kind of generate this data is through developing these open source models in house. I always like to grab open source models, or to know what these models are in the market, and to make them in house, to make sure that we can then generate the data through those same models, through like face swapping different data set, real face data sets that we have, or by generating deep fakes off of them and then feeding that into our model.

S Speaker 311:29Yeah, and we have more secret sauce on data preparation and pre processing, because we know that all the image are the back fob that we download, or we deployed to generate those data, those images cannot be really good quality. So we have the algorithm to ensure all those images are really high quality of defect instead of just random people. So we will do some race matching. For example, if you are white person, then your face is like, publicly swap another white person and make it more realistic. And we are trying to, you know, knowing the technology that scammer are using right now was,
Yeah, and we have more secret sauce on data preparation and pre processing, because we know that all the image are the back fob that we download, or we deployed to generate those data, those images cannot be really good quality.

S Speaker 112:16was there another I'm trying to remember there's another question attached to that, or was that answer everything,
was there another I'm trying to remember there's another question attached to that, or was that answer everything,
was there another I'm trying to remember there's another question attached to that, or was that answer everything,
was there another I'm trying to remember there's another question attached to that, or was that answer everything,
S Speaker 212:23probably the first part of the question, which is, how do you generate your own synthetic data sets? Do you use any specific models? Is it an in house model? How going about that?

S Speaker 312:34So we collect the most updated defect technology out there, about 5050, the defect generation effort out there and deploy it locally. And we use those agentic workflow because we at the beginning, like the story is at the beginning. We try to deploy manually, one by one, yeah, realize that this is not sustainable, working by human that's why we decided to deploy agentic workflow so we can make sure we are small team, but we can inject huge amounts of data to train that model, comparing to larger company. Yeah,
So we collect the most updated defect technology out there, about 5050, the defect generation effort out there and deploy it locally. And we use those agentic workflow because we at the beginning, like the story is at the beginning.

Yeah,
S Speaker 213:13and I would love to understand a little bit more about how say the stack behind your agentic workflow works because that sounds super interesting just on top of your head. Roughly, how many say models across voice and images and videos, have you benchmarked or already integrated in your

13:39detection technology.
detection technology.

detection technology.
S Speaker 313:42We didn't really benchmark on the frost detection one, but we do a lot of benchmark on the image and video benchmark comparing to our competitors.
We didn't really benchmark on the frost detection one, but we do a lot of benchmark on the image and video benchmark comparing to our competitors.

13:53Okay, okay, no, yeah.
Okay, okay, no, yeah.
Okay, okay, no, yeah.
Okay, okay, no, yeah.
S Speaker 113:57And I think speaking upon the models, I think we can also go a little bit more in depth to kind of like, how does this kind of like, how do we ingest all this data, right? I think you probably already kind of like, kind of realized with this type of ingestion and how we're creating new data week by week. How can we fine tune our model based on it, without that catastrophic forgetting? Or is like, trying to make sure that everything is aligned and make sure that our model has that great distribution between all this data I can add towards that, and that's kind of where we have, like a patent pending solution, where we're able to basically add data dynamically into our data model without it, for getting the past data, without it changing its distribution of past data. Got it. We also publish our finding. We find that a lot of our past, like competitors, they think, like high reality defender, they don't publish anything to make sure everything is internal. But we believe, like in this kind of field, we really do need more movement on the research side. That's why we always publish anything that we kind of want to buy. We we always we ask, we publish our findings on things like, Hey, can it? LLM replicate deepfake detection, right? And so we test like, Gemini, chat, BT, clot, all that kind of the popular LM models, and see if we can detect deep fakes. And again, it is like, what we found is like, it isn't as suitable towards this sort of thinking. And then we also go through like different other like research problems that we kind of find, and that's why we publish all our findings. In the end, we also do want to have like a public data set for other people to benchmark our product versus other products based on it. We're still kind of working towards that
And I think speaking upon the models, I think we can also go a little bit more in depth to kind of like, how does this kind of like, how do we ingest all this data, right? I think you probably already kind of like, kind of realized with this type of ingestion and how we're creating new data week by week. How can we fine tune our model based on it, without that catastrophic forgetting? Or is like, trying to make sure that everything is aligned and make sure that our model has that great distribution between all this data I can add towards that, and that's kind of where we have, like a patent pending solution, where we're able to basically add data dynamically into our data model without it, for getting the past data, without it changing its distribution of past data.

S Speaker 215:26as well. Got it. Got it. Any place do you? Do you post it on your on your blogs, scammy eyes blog any, any place I can go read some of these?
as well. Got it. Got it. Any place do you? Do you post it on your on your blogs, scammy eyes blog any, any place I can go read some of these?
as well. Got it. Got it. Any place do you? Do you post it on your on your blogs, scammy eyes blog any, any place I can go read some of these?
as well. Got it. Got it. Any place do you? Do you post it on your on your blogs, scammy eyes blog any, any place I can go read some of these?
S Speaker 115:33No, yeah. I think we'll send you the data room. The data room has, like, all our kind of a research paper as well. So they're, like, published basically on, like the scientific journals. I think they're mostly focused, focused on like Ben. Ben is another co founder of ours. He does look a lot of research papers are posted on his like scientific journal, but when we send you the data room, it should also be there. Yeah, that'd be amazing. Oh, for sure. And it's like, another thing is, like, when we're thinking about a competition, it's like, okay, the there where are we kind of in that competition landscape, and what we're really dig down into it? We thought it's like, okay, the only thing within the deep fake market itself, what matters the most is Darwinism, right? Or the evolution velocity? How fast can your product evolve with the market? How fast can it, like, keep up with the other scammers, or even go ahead of the scammers, right? That's really what matters. And another thing is like, our thing is the evolutionary is the only long term solution for us, right? Because in the end, is like, how fast scammers are and how fast we are is like, what really matters is this. Another thing that we focused on is how human and fraud focused things are while other companies are focused on anything AI generated as deep fakes. They that's how they kind of classify them, as you can kind of see on the left, that's something that another hive put on their billboard. Basically, it's like they want to make sure that someone has swapped their dogs faces, or they generated like content on that. That's something they wanted to take but it was like, we don't really care about that. We don't care if someone has keeping a dog, because we don't think that. Because we don't think that will harm or impersonating what we're really focused on is human fraud focus. How, how much like are we focused on to make sure that they are using Internet content or deepfakes or any other algorithms to tamper with your face to make sure that you aren't impersonating anyone? Yeah. And as we kind of see this, where, of course, very focused on making sure our evolution velocity is the most important and that we're more human and fraud focus
No, yeah. I think we'll send you the data room. The data room has, like, all our kind of a research paper as well. So they're, like, published basically on, like the scientific journals.

S Speaker 217:29and new evolution velocity, 100% agree that's that's a KPI for a solution like this. How did you benchmark some of these other competitors lower in the evolution velocity metric.

S Speaker 317:43So basically, we testing out different solution for different vendor. So we using, we have lots of defect images out there. Yeah, and defect, there's a different patterns, like generation method. We can specifically see, for example, reality defender. They're working really well on like before, 2024 audit defect method. But certain type of new types of defect methods coming out, their benchmark is just typically dropped, so which means that there's certain level of the most updated defect attack method they are not like, update it into their detection backflow, yeah, fair enough.

S Speaker 118:26Another thing is like, this is something that our, like, advisors told us not to say. But what we think is, like, really important in here is that our competitors have spent, like, years in Facebook. We only spent months, and we're Reagan are we have a leading accuracy in the market. Through it, we're finding is like that is kind of the most important that evolution rate us being able to evolve with the market. Move with the market has been, is that led us to or is kind of the solution of ours? Of course, this is kind of our team. These are wonderful advisors. A lot of them have believe in us so much that a lot of them have become our first angel investors, in fact. So we're very fortunate to kind of have them on board as well.
Another thing is like, this is something that our, like, advisors told us not to say. But what we think is, like, really important in here is that our competitors have spent, like, years in Facebook.

S Speaker 219:04Yeah, that's, that's an amazing set. No, yeah. And
Yeah, that's, that's an amazing set. No, yeah. And
Yeah, that's, that's an amazing set. No, yeah. And
Yeah, that's, that's an amazing set. No, yeah. And
S Speaker 119:07this is kind of our use cases. We kind of talked about this a bit before, but there's kind of, like a wide variety of use cases for this kind of technology, as you kind of can understand with deepfakes, kind of being infiltrated anything with a video modality with it, or image modality with it. But what we kind of find and focus on is, like, KYC verification, and there is dating approval interviews. These are kind of the people with their hair on my kind of moving this. It's like, we kind of talked with a bunch of different different companies. And, like, we talked with like, over 40 CISOs for enterprise security. And always, like, the question comes up is like, Hey, you kind of concerned with deepfakes. What are you guys going to plan for next year? Yes, we're very, very concerned with deepfakes. We think is a really big problem, and we need to find some sort of defense for it. But we're finding that when we ask for their budget, or it's like, when we ask, like, hey, how much do you want to allocate towards a solution like ours, they're like, Oh, we're not ready yet. We don't have a budget for this again, but the people that we see, and we don't think they're ready yet, but we do believe that in the future, enterprise security will be a really big market, and we want to be there. We want to be credible in that space. So then we started looking further. We're like, Okay, who has their hair on fire this situation? And there are a lot of different other companies for it, in particular, ID verification, KYC companies, again, the people that banks work with to make sure they know who their customers are. A lot of them are fully bypassed deep fakes. We've tested over like 3040 of these KYC vendors, and it's like all a lot of them. We use our own deepfake technology in house, and we're able to create accounts through them. So and we finding is like, if these people can't solve the problem, their clients will start dropping them, and that's why they have their hair and fire in this
this is kind of our use cases. We kind of talked about this a bit before, but there's kind of, like a wide variety of use cases for this kind of technology, as you kind of can understand with deepfakes, kind of being infiltrated anything with a video modality with it, or image modality with it.

situation. Yeah, agree. Sorry.
situation. Yeah, agree. Sorry.
situation. Yeah, agree. Sorry.
S Speaker 120:50Was there any other questions with that? Or are we all good? Okay, perfect. Our current traction kind of looks like this. Again. We're really focused on those. KYC verification companies we're also looking towards, like getting apps and remote interviews that also have this, like, high urgency and high pain point frequency currently, uh, we are working with, like LG you, as we kind of mentioned that the Korean telecom company, we actually, right now, moved into a contracting phase of them. So right now we're, we're, like, exchanging data sets where they're paying for, like, new data, giving them towards scam data for them, we're also working with other startups like ditto AI dating at the boss AI for like, online interview, or moving towards those KYC verification vendors, as you can as we mentioned, jumio Bureau and Danto trulu, all these are, like, big KYC vendors, and we're able to kind Of like, right now, we're going with an engineering details more. What would the pilot kind of look like? What would the data kind of look like? And that's, that's kind of what we're doing with these ones in the pipeline. Of course, you have like, figure weighing all these like, kind of different other companies with like KYC, Id vendors, as well as like notary companies, trying to see, like, what our use case can do within the kind of space I'll explore.
Was there any other questions with that? Or are we all good? Okay, perfect. Our current traction kind of looks like this. Again. We're really focused on those.

What would the pilot kind of look like? What would the data kind of look like? And that's, that's kind of what we're doing with these ones in the pipeline. Of course, you have like, figure weighing all these like, kind of different other companies with like KYC, Id vendors, as well as like notary companies, trying to see, like, what our use case can do within the kind of space I'll explore.
Was there any other questions with that? Or are we all good? Okay, perfect. Our current traction kind of looks like this. Again. We're really focused on those.

Got it. This is kind of what our
S Speaker 122:03go to market strategy looks like. It's kind of like what our timeline would hope to kind of have. We are focused, very focused on, like IP verification, KYC companies, as well as like online interviews, you know, the small, high urgency, high paid frequency apps. For the first year or so. We believe in the next two or three years, enterprise security will be ready. It just like a matter of fact, we think right now, like this year has been really, really big, and we think next year is going to be even bigger. And if that doesn't change their mind, it's like it has to change your mind three because back then, I think the scammers will have a much wider range of attack, which is why they won't be focused with enterprise security to see things like that. We'll also be looking towards creating a consumer level app for kind of a data flywheel, AI driven fraud protection. We'll have, like, some sort of consumer apps to collect data so that we can also feed it towards our model. That's kind of what we're thinking. Also towards that those year two and four and in four plus, we want to kind of become a CrowdStrike for humans, for all kinds of businesses, individuals and government. We kind of want to be able to say, hey, we can detect any sort of scams, be it deepfakes, voice, clothing, anything they kind of want to throw at it. We'll have like a all in one security company for that.

S Speaker 323:16And one more thing to add, as like, we don't want to position ourselves as a defect detection company, but we put quantum position ourselves our AI driven fraud prevention company. That's the difference, because like we can foresee like defect is just a part of the scam. But you know, nowadays, scammer earn a lots of money using traditional technique. What happened if the scammer using those different types of AI, automation, more personalization, different attack network, it's going to be really huge. So the defect detection model, force code detection model at the foundation layer that can support for us to build a larger picture. But, yeah, makes sense.

Make sense? No. Sorry, we're moving
S Speaker 124:03a little bit over time, so I'm going to basically go through exactly so this is kind of what our market opportunity looks like. Of course, more focused on this specific defect detection in Syracuse. Our sum is under 40 million, but we're hoping to move towards the tab of 240, 5 billion, towards our crowds, for humans. Our current business model, of course, is API SaaS, we want to draw API calls anytime someone has an image they want to see if it's keeping tampered or not, they're going to pull through our API, and we'll tell them the confidence threshold through that right now we see that. there's around, like, 70 billion ID checks from like, KYC, the D vendor, and then there's like, 9 billion remote interviews per years. And it's like, what we're trying to we're hoping that we're going to have like, an average price of, like, around one cent per call, and it costs around, like, point 03, cents per call, a 70% profit margin. And again, it's like, if we can get even like, 1% of ID checks, that's already that's already, like $100 million a year. So we're trying to move towards that space. Make sense? Yes, again, is it gonna ask way to kind of move the route into it? But we're looking for like, $2 million if we, right now, have allocation of ours that we have an allocation of 500k left, or you have a lead investor and everything, kind of like, led up to there, yeah, this is kind of who we are, what we do. Any other
a little bit over time, so I'm going to basically go through exactly so this is kind of what our market opportunity looks like. Of course, more focused on this specific defect detection in Syracuse.

S Speaker 225:16questions? No, no, not really. I would love to take a look at the data room and have a discussion with the team. I think, just from an investment perspective, this is around early for us. Just given the check size, we would love to take the entire round, but that's not how it works. So, so I understand that. Is this the first institutional round that you're raising? Yes, that's, that's amazing, guys, like a lot of I can totally see great progress made in months, right? That's, that's amazing, for sure.
