S Speaker 21:26No, Hi, I'm Rafi sands, CEO of tandem. Tandem is an online marketplace for office space. We have 135 customers who spend $5.7 million a year on rent through our payments platform, while we certainly aren't the first to build in this space, now is a fundamentally different time. From San Francisco to New York, Houston to Chicago, offices everywhere are half as full as they were pre covid. This is a $4 trillion industry in crisis. As vacancy rates increase, tenants are demanding more ease and flexibility than the traditional office. Brokerage process facilitates. We take the software application layer of WeWork, find and lease space easily, on more flexible terms, and we make it available to landlords in their own spaces. Unlike WeWork, we don't lease space, we don't renovate space, and we don't operate space. We've grown to 47k in MRR and our customers love us. We are tandem. Thank you.

S Speaker 44:11Hi. I am Louis co founder of glasscube. Glasscube is an open source package manager for Kubernetes. We ourselves are a team of experienced DevOps engineers with deep Kubernetes expertise. If you have used Kubernetes, you know how fragmented it is. Deploying applications across multiple environments is nearly impossible and a painfully manual process. Glass cube makes it easy to deploy to any infrastructure, whether it's cloud, multi cloud, or on prem. What we're building has really hit a nerve in the Kubernetes community. Since our launch in February, we've already gotten 2900 GitHub stocks, and let's talk revenue. In the last 90 days, we grew from 15,000 to $97,000 in ARR over 80,000 organizations worldwide already use Kubernetes. The market opportunity to become critical infrastructure exceeds $4 billion weird glass cube.

S Speaker 66:20Hey everybody, I'm Ben, the CEO of snowpilot. Snowpilot is the data warehouse that's as simple as a spreadsheet. For example, sales teams can use snowpilot to pull product usage data directly from the database without needing an engineer. Together, we have over 15 years of experience building big data products at enterprise and startup scale at Adobe, Dom built the machine learning engine that allocates $1 billion in annual marketing spend. At Microsoft. I built microservices that power hundreds of millions of daily users together at census, we built the data stack that powers Activision, HubSpot and figma. In two weeks, we built a connected warehouse that's able to join millions of rows of data across sources like Salesforce and Postgres, all with subsequent queries we are selling to the 500,000 companies who use a database but do not have a data engineer, unlocking a $5 billion a year market opportunity. In the future, we will become the single source of truth for all of the company's data, enabling an entire massive app ecosystem to run their businesses on our platform. We are snowpilot. Thank you. Applause.

S Speaker 1213:57Hi, my name is Jai, and I'm one of the co founders of 1849 bio. 1849 makes microbes that mining companies can use to unlock metal that is otherwise trapped in untouchable ore. Today, there is roughly $800 billion worth of copper alone sitting in unusable piles and mine sites. My co founder, Yong Jin and I met while doing our PhDs in bioengineering at MIT, I started my first company while in grad school, and young Judy spent the last few years working on the most successful genetically edited microbe ever deployed in the field. Since moving into lab space in July, we've already engineered our first microbe, which we did 2x faster than anybody else has, and have figured out how to increase our experimental output 100x we charge a royalty on the material. We enable mining companies to process with a 2% royalty. We have a roughly $40 billion total market split between copper and gold. We're 1849 bio. Thank you. You

S Speaker 1315:07Hi, my name is Dean, and I'm the CEO of zeropath. Zeropath is building a developer tool that autonomously finds and fixes software vulnerabilities. We're a team of world class bug bounty hunters and red teamers from Google and Tesla, and we wanted to make an AI that could perform the security testing we do at scale. We launched two months ago and rented $3,500 in monthly recurring revenue from 10 customers with zero churn. And the application security market we're targeting is already here, gives a bajillion dollar market opportunity today and in the future, companies of all sizes will need to secure their software against increasingly sophisticated threats, including those soon to be performed by AI systems. And one way you can sell a security scanner that actually works is by using it on open source products and reporting exploits through established channels. And to that end, we've used our AI to find over 15 serious vulnerabilities for popular GitHub repositories, which are currently in responsible disclosure pipelines for Hulu, Netflix and other devices, companies.

S Speaker 1517:29Hi, I'm the CEO of Mandy. Mandy makes it easy for companies here their skill assessment interview. We do this by providing a voice and interview group that can handle complex interviews like case study for consulting, role play for BPOS, or technical interviews for engineers. Just two months after starting to build we have secured the pilot with a consulting firm. Those complex interviews represent more than one 50 million applicants each year on average, which are $50 interview, which is a $7 billion market opportunity. Our team leader for former consultants and AI engineers from natively Uber and architect knows that the skill assessment interviews are the most costly and time consuming part of the hiring journey, and we are now automating them with AI we are minding. Thank you.

S Speaker 1618:33Hi, I'm Jacob, and I'm the CEO of Winford AI. Winford AI builds tools for institutional credit investors to monitor investments and improve underwriting decisions. Our platform saves investors 10 plus hours each week on painstaking tasks like processing legal documents and borrower financials. I left my role as a private credit investor at Blackstone to tackle hair on fire pain points I faced when underwriting over $4 billion in transactions. Our CTO was an engineer at Microsoft, where he shipped Gen AI enabled products to millions of active users. We just launched a free trial beta of our product, which is already used by investors at funds that manage over 10 billion the private credit market is massive and opaque. Behind the glamor of news making private equity transactions and music royalty deals is a $40 trillion industry of high interest B to B loans squeaking by on legacy software platforms. We're Winfred AI, thank you. You

S Speaker 2023:25Hi everyone. Ola Neha V gates, I'm John the CEO of consult. Is the easiest way to take your app International. It uses AI to analyze your code and give you great translations everywhere with one client, whether you've got deals coming in from other countries, or you just want to serve your Spanish speaking users in the US. You can just install Quetzal in all the different areas of your app that you want to translate, and we give you continuous grade translations instantly at a fraction of the cost of existing products, or hiring in house translators. I worked at Slack for three years on the slack Connect team, which has tons of international users, and I saw a slow translation system with bad translation results. Brendan, my co founder, worked at a retail startup from the founder of WOOT and Amazon acquisition, and saw them hire in house translators, which took months and cost a ton. So we decided to create Quetzal. We launched three weeks ago. We've already got five pilot customers, and we're adding two more each week, with 425,000 software companies in the US and Europe, an average contract value of 15,000 This is a $6.5 billion market today. We are Quetzal. Thank you. Gracias. You.

S Speaker 2732:51Hi, I'm manchatho, CEO of mica. Mica builds AI agents that automate B to B sales. Our first agents analyze sales calls, generate tailored collateral and follow up until a deal is closed. We're at 7k MRR, going 50% monthly with 30 customers. I founded mica with two close friends from UC Berkeley, Jay and barter launch at our last jobs, we saw that the best sales reps weren't just great at selling. We were also elite content creators. They crafted tailored collateral like decks and highlight videos personalized for each buyer, but this often took over 30 minutes per call, and with multiple calls per day, even the best sales reps could only prioritize some clients, leaving millions in Lost deals. Micah's agents reduced this to under one minute, allowing everyone to sell like a top performer on every deal. Sales collateral generation and follow up is an $11 billion market in the United States, in the United States, and this is just our beachhead. Eventually, we'll ship a fleet of agents that automate and eventually replace every other facet of the $80 billion enterprise sales market we are. Micah, thank you. Applause.

My co founders, farsh and I grew up in India, we saw the problems our parents faced by saving only in rupees. Paying for my Berkeley college tuition got 5% more expensive every year as the rupee depreciate against the dollar, navigating capital controls to send the money overseas for expenses was a constant headache, and now, as they build multi generational wealth, they're still at risk because they lack access to stable and diversified investments. Today, 1.7 million HNIs across South Asia and the Middle East face the same problem as my parents. We charge 1% on the assets under management, making this a $67 billion market. This is pasa.

There is a promise that AI agents will automate human work, but to do that, AI agents need APIs for the software that humans use. These APIs don't exist. We solve this. For example, one customer is automating health insurance form filling, and they use us to integrate with insurers. Since going live two weeks ago, we already have over $5,000 in booked MRR. We met at Cornell CS as freshmen and worked at PayPal and Microsoft. We are key. Thank you. Professional

For example, one customer is automating health insurance form filling, and they use us to integrate with insurers. Since going live two weeks ago, we already have over $5,000 in booked MRR. We met at Cornell CS as freshmen and worked at PayPal and Microsoft. We are key. Thank you. Professional

S Speaker 939:35Hi, my name is Aman, and I'm the CEO of further AI. At further AI, we're building an AI workforce for the insurance industry today, insurance is usually manual, with over 100 billion in basic efforts, just in the United States, insurance professionals spend 70% of their time manually reading documents and entering their data into outdated softwares. This can now be automated using datalabs. We are starting by automating back office operations at insurance brokerages, including tasks like policy checking and proposal generation. We lost seven weeks ago, and we already have 120 6k in ARR, knowing 100% every month. Additionally, we have over 2 million in active pipeline. This is my second company. I scaled my previous company to over seven figures in ARR, my co founder, who worked as an AI researcher at Apple, and have first in experience with building AI agents. We have known each other for over 10 years, and are super excited to be building agents for traditional industries. We are further AI Thank you, Indians. I payment.

S Speaker 3442:03Hey, we're random labs. My name is Kieran, and with my co founder me here, we're building the best open source pair programmer. Our tool has done millions of organic impressions, has 1000s of GitHub stars, and has over 1200 monthly installs. Our agent is the only open source coding agent you can install today with one command. Unlike other tools, we know for a fact that ours has been used by engineers that companies like Apple and they didn't even need to ask their managers. We know the winner of the cogen space will be an open source agent working with open source language models being used by hundreds of 1000s of big tech engineers, and we're the best choice for them. If you want to understand why come talk to us. Wear random labs. Thank you.

S Speaker 3542:56Hi everyone. I'm Derek, CEO of fractal labs. We are building AI Roblox. Our vision is a UGC platform where anyone can create games like Skyrim or black myth WooCommerce without knowing how to code. My co founders and I met in Princeton at undergrad. I published multiple papers on llms while at Google research, all of which were accepted to neurips. Jason worked as a full stack engineer at both Google and Duolingo and Alan was an HFT quant trader at virtue developing algorithms to trade options. We've been building our AI game engine for the last five months, and are launching our first game in action RPG with generated spells, worlds and narratives. The play testers this week, there are 108 million RPG players in our target demographic of 18 to 44 year olds, we expect $100 in annual revenue per player and a 25% crater payout, making this an $8 billion market opportunity. We're a fractal labs.

S Speaker 3644:03Vlad. Hi, I'm Vlad, and I'm the CEO of pathpilot. Pathpilot is an AI customer experience agent. When people use web products, they leave behind a story in the form of a user session replay. Nearly every software company stores these session replays, but nobody watches them. It's too time consuming, our AI observes these user experiences, then takes action. It identifies leaks in the funnel, it triages bugs, and it follows up directly with customers. Today, US companies spend over $25 billion staffing customer experience teams. Most of the work these employees do can be automated by our AI agents, we launched three weeks ago and are already live with 12 companies at 24k Arr, with 13 more pilots underway, we just signed two additional Lois valued at over $100,000 my co founder, Victor, scaled Facebook videos from zero to over a billion monthly users. I worked with Victor at Facebook, and I'm returning to Demo Day After selling my previous YC company. We are pathpilot. Thank you.

S Speaker 3347:30Hi, my name is Walker, and we are brighter. Way brighter. Way uses AI to create a review of medical records for physicians focusing on med legal exams. We launched in July and will make $40,000 in revenue next month, as we have been growing over 100% month over month, physicians typically spend hours reviewing 1000s of pages of medical records. Imagine reading through the full notes of every doctor's appointment you've ever had, and doing that 50 more times at brighter way we structure all the patient's medical records, arrange them chronologically and pull out what is medically relevant for the doctor's given specialty. We first realized our product could work after I broke my ankle at Yale last year, and when I explained to my orthopedic surgeon what Jason and I had built, he told us he used to do medical legal cases, but had stopped because it was too time incentive. But if he could use our product, he would like to start doing it again. We are brighter way. Thank you.
