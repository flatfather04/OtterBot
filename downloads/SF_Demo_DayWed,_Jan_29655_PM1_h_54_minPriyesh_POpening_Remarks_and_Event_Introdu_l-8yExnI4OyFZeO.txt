S Speaker 514:33So the focus for today's demo, we wanted to talk about multi agent systems. So over time, for folks that are building the space, you find that you need either more tools than an agent is able to handle, or there's additional context that you want to keep within systems in a provisioned way. Over time, you find that multi agent systems are a good bet. So the one that we're going to be looking at today a few different ones, uses what we call a supervisor agent to control a number of sub agents. Those sub agents for us are spreadsheet, writing, document writing security and compliance reports, and then everything from email management and private let's start with the first one

S Speaker 516:09So today we're hooked up into, I believe, 25 systems operating on a number of different asset types. There's a few examples under the asset type here. What's happening under the transfer search? It's going to be opening these opening these one at a time. As it opens, it's able to read any one of these documents. And then for part two, it's actually going to be writing them all to a spreadsheet results, which, in this case is an assessment of various usefulness of documents against organization.

S Speaker 516:41brutal, brutal. And each time you think you're done, you meet a new company that did it differently. So it's exciting all the way the next one I'll load up here, for folks that are in more data science space is an in depth analysis of a spreadsheet. This one, I believe, is few 100,000 rows, it's going to create an action plan for us. It's going to farm out this action plan, then to that notebook agent that we talked about from before, and it's going to autonomously go and run various cells in this Jupiter notebook, both in the back end, and then it's going to run into that in the front end. So that way you can take over at any point. What we found is the most useful is by showing the user at any given stage, they can pause it, take over, clean it up, then over time, adding more and more memory management allows us to learn what are the right preferences or workflows, which are gonna be different company to company, regardless of the underlying tech. That tech being creating a document, looking through your email, the way you answer an email and generate a Python analysis is very different. Are

S Speaker 517:49I think the entry level analyst role is purposely horizontal. When you hire someone out of university, you train them up in the organization. And that's the special power of these orgs, is training people to be really good at their job and then become an asset within the organization. So what we're allowing them to do is to do that repeatedly. The work we do at Anheuser looks very different than the work we're doing at a law firm, but it actually looks more similar than another beverage company. So what we find is actually organizations have very different workflows, even while in the same industry, so horizontal and allowing them to configure it at the edge is what we find the most beneficial

20:07and the information
S Speaker 520:12on chatgpt, it works. The interface layer is the big one for us, right? Like under the hood, we have 25 models providers, so we're hooked into those systems. The big difference is we're going to be rendering that thing in front of them. They can then edit that live. So instead of just spitting out the Excel, then you take that and you to talk to it to adjust, I can, as a user, physically start typing and taking over. This operates fully in the back end. So for example, you don't have to have this thing rendered. So we can be creating these call on the system and say, Hey, here's the login finish the last piece that I couldn't do myself. So there's an interface layer that I think we've nailed. So the

S Speaker 721:19Awesome. One more question, is there a specific workflow that, like, blows analysts minds? Like, I think you have a ton of functionality here, like, is there one or two examples you give us where, like, someone can do something that they can't do now, or something happens? What's

S Speaker 521:35Yeah, so we have it join every meeting, and it hooks up to your email, given that, every time a meeting ends and every time you get an email, it extracts the to do list. This exists for so much software, but because we have all the enterprise data, you can actually just do it. So you finish a meeting and you're like, hey, I have to go send these three people reports and go generate this. They'll just do

You guys are working, yes, okay, great, okay, awesome.
S Speaker 823:12All right, hey everyone. Who are you? What are you building? I am Akash, co founder of big smart AI, and we're building consumer AI so you can actually go here right now, and you can just use this if you want. It's for everyone. That's why it's big. So this started me and my CTO Peters. We were big users of perplexity, and we hated going to like Google all the time for like 80% of our queries, because when I put an Airbnb crunch, base perplexity gives me nothing, which I'm going to demonstrate in a bit here. I hope our event isn't sitting in the crowd. But basically, the way we saw it is queries split into kind of like three categories. You know, there's the 80% which is, I just want to top link or a really instant answer. It's very straight up, very straightforward. Then there's like, oh, I need to, like, get a lot of web results. I need to go pretty deep in research. I need to follow up. And then the third thing is, I need to chat with the intelligence of the model chat. GPT is really, really good at the third one. They're not so great at search right now. Perplexity is pretty good at that, but neither of them are good at that first one. How do I get something simple? And so we were like, Okay, what if we were just good at all of them, and especially the first two to start with. And so I'll show you guys an example before I start running some live ones. But the reason I bring this one up, it's like, pretty random. I don't know how many of you are familiar with the top dog names in France, but I actually had somebody literally message me this yesterday, and they were like, you know, I was searching for Top Dog names in France, and, you know, you guys just told me, like, dog names that are really popular in America, that are like, French, and that's not what I wanted. And so we sat there and like, you know, we looked through a query, and then we kind of restructured it a bit, and we came up with, okay, the right way to ask, this is, actually, what are the top dog names in France? But to be fair, we work with keyword keyword search too. So like, you know, you can argue it should have worked. And so then we actually like, and I'm not gonna like go click into these links right now, but we actually went and we found that, oh, these names, actually, if you dig in here, are ones that people in France actually name their dogs. And so if you compare this to perplexity, where these are actually just dog names that are French, that people in America like, or chatgpt, where they didn't even really source anything, even though they did run a search and they did the same thing, you can see we came up with kind of like better answers. And so that's kind of where we get better in depth. But really, like I said, Right there's the Airbnb contrabass query. And so with us, what we do is, and I'll just run this again so you guys can see, but what we do is, within a little while, we'll give you links that are like Google to your quality right away, right? Because that's probably what you want if you search Airbnb conspace. And then we'll also actually like successfully complete the scrape, and we'll give you the information there if I go do this in perplexity right now, and I literally run Airbnb CrunchBase. And to be fair, this isn't their pro mode, but you guys can run that yourself if you want. I stopped paying for perplexity probes. I don't want to fund competitors, but Peter can run that for you if you want. You'll see that like they didn't even pull up any crunch based links. And there's a variety of reasons for that, like most of which I don't actually know, because, you know, I don't know how their back end works.
All right, hey everyone. Who are you? What are you building?

And then, okay, so you got the quick answer, you get some. So we also
And then, okay, so you got the quick answer, you get some. So we also
S Speaker 826:55have some knowledge cards, as you can see, that we partnered with taco on. So if you were looking for like, sports results, you get those. But we have the instant answer, which we serve up with, like, a serve up with, like, a very fast model. And so that would be, like, much faster than anything perplexity or, like, really, anyone can give you. And then we have like, immediate links, right? We try to serve those up under, like, 700 milliseconds. It's not as fast as Google as everyone else is used to, but they're they're there. And then we have, like, a whole, like, deep dive, right? And we'll give you videos sometimes in images, what's this at the bottom? And so then I can actually, like, follow up. So I can be like, Okay, well, you know, like, I don't know. Maybe I'm like, what are the best, what are the best places to stay in?
have some knowledge cards, as you can see, that we partnered with taco on. So if you were looking for like, sports results, you get those.

27:40And so thoughtful the conversation, yeah. And so this is
And so thoughtful the conversation, yeah. And so this is
And so thoughtful the conversation, yeah. And so this is
And so thoughtful the conversation, yeah. And so this is
S Speaker 827:43the thing you don't get with Google right now, right? And you do get this in perplexity. You'll get this with others. But what we'll do is we'll actually run, like, a whole new neural search on this. We'll get you the results you actually want, so you can click in, right if you need to. And we'll, like, actually, like, pull these results out. And so I think, like, the whole point of this is, you know, you can literally just search from your URL, and you can get your Google quality results right away, which, right now, like, you know, if you do that with kind of these other services, the results I get are, maybe they're good for like sources, but not so much for other things. And with us, like, you'll get the Google over results, and you'll also get all the AI answers and the AI follow ups, and so, yeah, that's what we've built. And I showed you kind of some knowledge cards. If you search like Nvidia, which I'll quickly do here, we'll pull that up too. And the reason I don't like, jump into kind of like deeper queries is because I want you guys to try that out. But you know, we'll pull up an instant answer. You guys will get, like, like, some amount of like information. They actually ran this in our Canary environment, where we don't serve knowledge cards right now, but you know, you'll get, like, stock information and whatever else. Yeah, pretty straightforward, but try it out. Awesome.
the thing you don't get with Google right now, right? And you do get this in perplexity. You'll get this with others. But what we'll do is we'll actually run, like, a whole new neural search on this.

S Speaker 428:51And got time for a couple questions. Any questions? Yeah,

And got time for a couple questions. Any questions? Yeah,
S Speaker 928:59oh gosh. Great. Demo. Quick question, how do I know that the the response you are giving is really the best one? Yeah? So
oh gosh. Great. Demo. Quick question, how do I know that the the response you are giving is really the best one? Yeah? So
oh gosh. Great. Demo. Quick question, how do I know that the the response you are giving is really the best one? Yeah? So
oh gosh. Great. Demo. Quick question, how do I know that the the response you are giving is really the best one? Yeah? So
S Speaker 829:07that's actually something that we get asked a lot, and I think response is the best one, yeah. And, you know, the thing, the thing with this kind of product is, like, right now, like, you really have to be a power user of these things where you're gonna go dig in and you're gonna figure out that is this actually the best you know? Generally, we recommend people search for stuff like at first when they try it out. Like, you can either try it out like, side by side, right, or you can search for things you already know right, where you know what the right answer should be. And maybe, you know, chat GPT messed it up for you. That's the best way to test it out, to be honest. But you know, we don't do like, live emails, because it is a consumer product at the end of the end of the day, and we actually think, like, there's some more interesting place in other directions than just correctness. I got a question

I got a question
S Speaker 429:48in terms of, like, the user behavior, you've got sort of three modes, quick answer, slow it like, thoughtful answer and interactive answer. Yeah. Where are you seeing people like, what's the split between those modes?

S Speaker 830:00Yeah, so follow ups are actually a pretty low split right now, I would say, like, like, maybe like 10% of like queries end up being follow ups. Most people love the instant answer, actually. And I think the reason is, again, like 80% of queries actually fall in that first category, and nobody's really serving those up. Well, actually, ironically, Google's the best of that

30:17awesome question,
S Speaker 1030:18super quick question, are you guys actually scraping the web or using some third party provider?
super quick question, are you guys actually scraping the web or using some third party provider?
super quick question, are you guys actually scraping the web or using some third party provider?
super quick question, are you guys actually scraping the web or using some third party provider?
S Speaker 830:24Yeah, great question. So we're using a combination. So we have our own, like, scraping infrastructure, which we run in, like, like that actually works really well. That's why we're able to get good results. But then we do also use third party providers right now, because we actually whip this thing out in a month and a half. So in order to be good on that, we give you guys the best results from like kind of multiple sources.

S Speaker 1332:24a little bit. I worked at GitHub for seven years. We were the biggest Rails app and monolith, and so breaking that into individual services and moving towards a service oriented architecture was probably one of the most painful things that I've had to do in my career, because it involved looking at somebody like legacy,

S Speaker 1232:44yeah, back of the cuff. We've talked to folks at GitHub, we've talked to folks at a lot of large organizations who have gone through this, and it's easily hundreds of millions of dollars in engineering, hours spent on just untangling and untangling. So yeah, we really want to make that a problem that is actually solvable, actually tractable, awesome. How do you solve it? Yeah. So we've been building some open source tools that's kind of what I'm going to demo today, alongside bit of our kind of platform that accompanies that. And so our first tool is called TAC, T, A, C, H. It is Python library that will actually scan your code base and pick up kind of what are modules and what aren't modules? This is something you can actually interact with to define, basically the things you're trying to break apart in your code base. So here I actually have sentries code base as an example. They're one of the biggest open source Python monolithic repos on GitHub. And let's just go ahead and mark up, you know, a couple modules that we might, we might care about here. So I've kind of marked on the top level modules, but we'll, we'll take a few more for the purposes of this demo, and if I save this, we can run attack sync. And what this is doing is our open source tool is actually basically reading the entire code base, pulling out your existing set of dependencies and syncing that to a config file. And what this is, or what this looks like, is basically for each module, what does that thing depend on? What you can actually do then is like, start to work on fixing some of these things right? So if we were to take, you know, sentry analytics, for example, and I wanted to break this up, what you can actually do is, kind of modify your config, look at the output and see what those dependencies are and how to break them. For the purposes of, you know, kind of this demo, I'll kind of jump straight into something that's a little bit more visual. So we also kind of have built a platform around this. We're going to take all the information from the code base, take all the information from this config we've generated, and we can actually start to visualize this for your code base. So here's centrist code base we can actually look at, you know, the, like, pretty large number of dependencies that are coming through between these modules, the usages and kind of cycles and all these really, like, nasty things that developers have to work on. This actually gives you kind of the direct set of bread comes to go solve these problems. So we can go in to, you know, any specific module, again, like sensory analytics, and take a look at the interface, how it's consumed. This will all link like directly to your code base, all that good stuff. And then also actually visualize what the module graph looks like, which gives you a really clear starting point for some of the things that are like actually kind of big problems. So for example, here we can kind of see sentry API and sentry auth. We have a cycle here. This can basically cause a lot of problems, right? If someone changes something in one place, it can have an impact in many, many other locations. And the way we can actually kind of enforce against this is through kind of an actual platform that integrates with GitHub. So we have basically a little bot that will catch these errors, prevent developers from introducing them, as well as a set of checks that we expose that will basically enforce that you're moving in the right direction, and then also basically provide you the insights that you need to go tackle and fix these things over time. Kind of the last piece here, this is a Gen AI night. We've also built some tooling to specifically go and actually analyze a specific set of relationships and provide you context on the steps you actually need to take to break these things apart. Cool,
yeah, back of the cuff. We've talked to folks at GitHub, we've talked to folks at a lot of large organizations who have gone through this, and it's easily hundreds of millions of dollars in engineering, hours spent on just untangling and untangling.

S Speaker 1438:09you have any suggestions how to move later, to differentiation code base? So it's supposed to people right now, like trying to people, to avoid to reuse the same code base and like internal dependencies? Do you have ideas how to move where it's automatically deployed?

S Speaker 1238:25Yeah. So something we're also actively working on is code mods. Basically, can we actually just do this work for you? Right? So if we look at this cycle, for example, what are the dependencies that are crossing this specific boundary, on this specific edge, we can actually go and refactor that for you. And so we want to be able to both, you know, take the rule set that you provide, isolate code and enforce that it stays that way over time, too. So we have explored a couple different approaches. So with code mod specifically, we can take you can write code that moves code, and so there's a couple of cool approaches that are actually using kind of a generative step to write the code, mod itself, and then we can run that, put up the PR and have that kind of being reviewed by a developer at the end of the

Then I generate the, what I call the nuanced graph, using the nuanced enrich command, and so that we don't have to suffer with my typos. I have it right over here so I can copy and paste it. It's generating the nuanced graph. And as you can see, it didn't I can LS, I can see that the nuanced graph exists. Then I'm going to fire up my coding agent, and I'm going to or my coding assistant, and I'm going to tell you basically, or show you what it looks like to use it without nuanced, and what it looks like to use it and ask a question with Nuance. So I'm going to ask it, I'm going to add basically the file of the function that's under test, and then I'm going to say, you know, basically, can you concisely explain how we might update this data frame to ensure that this test actually passes,

What is nuanced graph? Is it like architecture of different macro services, of manually, like a software engineer, we also think in mind map like that, how different macro services work. And do you have this?
S Speaker 1345:31Yeah, yeah. So that's totally right. The goal is actually to be a cross service, sort of, you know, map of everything, right? And by cross service, I don't necessarily just mean code. As a developer, you integrate context for so many information sources, I think so many of us trace through sentry exceptions, and we look at telemetry on Datadog, and we, you know, often see errors in production systems, because the runtime environment is just totally different than what you might be able to test locally, and all of that context right now is missing from these AI coding agents. We want to be able to give like that rich understanding. But what we're starting with right now is one single repository, one single project, and we're using basically a call graph that we're generating using ASTs as well as, like, a different formalism. And then we're taking, but we're not taking the entire call graph of the entire code base. We're taking basically, you know, we're starting with the one function that we care about, and then if that function references other functions, we basically create a sub graph and we annotate it with information about like, is this function pure? Does it have side effects? Does it change anything? That sort of thing. That's sort of what we're starting with. Does that answer your question? Okay,
Yeah, yeah. So that's totally right. The goal is actually to be a cross service, sort of, you know, map of everything, right? And by cross service, I don't necessarily just mean code.

S Speaker 1656:11so first off, we now have 500 paying customers. We launched our self serve onboarding on January 1, so now you can go to RNA and sign up. We're very inexpensive. We're 10 bucks and 50 cents a month per active user only. It's not like an infomercial, but if you were to go through and buy all those individual products, not only do we offer a far better experience, it's far cheaper. Rome is also global. When you think about a company of tomorrow, a company of tomorrow is ultimately going to have a couple of properties. The first is that is going to be globally distributed. My last company, when we started, we were a few people in a room, and then we were 30 people in a room, and then we were 3000 people around the world. The reality is, every company that succeeds becomes globally distributed, and what you need to do is get them all working together from around the world, as if they were in the same room from anywhere. That's the first the second thing about a company of the future, company of tomorrow, is that it's going to be fully digitized all these AI tools that you are all building. Rome is not an AI company. We're going to enable others to we're going to bring AI to our customers in an interface, right all the AI that you are building, it's going to leverage meetings and chats, and by the way, observing who's talking to who on the map, there's lots of signal that in order to make human experiences, we're going to have to get to end users, so that people are able to collaborate as if there are one team, humans and agents working side by side together.

We're going to enable others to we're going to bring AI to our customers in an interface, right all the AI that you are building, it's going to leverage meetings and chats, and by the way, observing who's talking to who on the map, there's lots of signal that in order to make human experiences, we're going to have to get to end users, so that people are able to collaborate as if there are one team, humans and agents working side by side together.
so first off, we now have 500 paying customers. We launched our self serve onboarding on January 1, so now you can go to RNA and sign up. We're very inexpensive. We're 10 bucks and 50 cents a month per active user only. It's not like an infomercial, but if you were to go through and buy all those individual products, not only do we offer a far better experience, it's far cheaper. Rome is also global. When you think about a company of tomorrow, a company of tomorrow is ultimately going to have a couple of properties. The first is that is going to be globally distributed. My last company, when we started, we were a few people in a room, and then we were 30 people in a room, and then we were 3000 people around the world.

is this? How much is this like an AI employee versus AI training? Currently,
S Speaker 659:33it's more AI training. And what we're kind of looking to do is kind of build up a corpus of data around how the best agents, human agents, work in contact centers, before ultimately looking to replace outsource contact centers, BPOS, as they're known. It's the kind of grandiose plan. And yeah, so we have a demo today. We prepared, and regime's allowed us to use his name here today, but this is me basically practicing a conversation. This is one of our training simulations that a center for support rep will use.

S Speaker 61:01:12Yeah, very fair and so, yeah, what we do is allow your agents to practice with AI customers so they're not learning sales leads.

S Speaker 61:01:27Yeah, so rather than you having manual trainers doing classroom based learning or role play training, we can scale that so we can build out training scenarios and you can assign them to all your agents at once,

S Speaker 41:02:13So this is what you see after you do, like, a training simulation. We got score breakdown. How are people using this right now? What are the adjustments that people are making after doing this training?

S Speaker 61:02:25Yeah, it's really good questions. Really, what we're seeing is where the tools having the most effect is reducing ramp time for new agents. So these large call centers, they have 100% agent attrition year over year. So it's very costly from getting them basically productive in these call centers. So we can reduce that. We have companies like crypto.com where we've got that down from 20 days to nine days. And obviously there's like,
Yeah, it's really good questions. Really, what we're seeing is where the tools having the most effect is reducing ramp time for new agents.

S Speaker 61:02:58Yeah. We Yeah. We're in YC at the moment, so we did our demo to our partner the other day. But yeah, we're it's really interesting. We're kind of tweaking the prompts a lot. We've got some customer feedback around people using the simulator, conversation simulator to practice like internal performance review conversations and, yeah, firing employees difficult conversations.

S Speaker 81:04:01So like, is that? Is that just, like, kind of, like, hey, this thing's in hard mode right now. So this person's gonna be a jerk? Or do you, like, kind of, like, do some like, background research on the person. Like, kind of give me a personalized jerk version of Rajiv. It's

S Speaker 71:04:13again, instead, we have like, a set of prompts that we put in. It actually is the most difficult part of this is tweaking the difficulty, because it's very hard to get it to be, like, mean, but not rude, or, like, you know, pushy, but not like an asshole. So yeah, there's like, lots of really tweaky prompts we've done to make easy, medium hard, and then we've more custom
again, instead, we have like, a set of prompts that we put in.

S Speaker 141:04:36Yeah, do you put any personality? Because I could imagine that different people have different charisma, and sometimes, like, charisma is quite unusual thing. And how do you, how do you measure that? It's like charisma in school, instead of, like, it's asshole. That's
Yeah, do you put any personality? Because I could imagine that different people have different charisma, and sometimes, like, charisma is quite unusual thing. And how do you, how do you measure that? It's like charisma in school, instead of, like, it's asshole. That's

1:04:55a great question. So
S Speaker 71:04:58there's a kind of a couple of aspects, I would say voice. So we allow customized voices, and you can tweak the personality and the hands down to like, how you describe them. One interesting point on that as well is like cultural differences. So we have teams, particularly we're from Ireland. We have teams across Europe, using it for all separate languages. And we have to really do so when we switch language, we also add little prompt being like, this person is from Spain. They have different cultural expectations. And so I think the kind of career piece, you know, one person's charismatic person is another person's like, overbearing person, and that can be very culturally demanded as well. And

S Speaker 71:05:52Two great questions. So the first one, we have teams who work on trust and safety teams, and so particularly for them. We chat on email based simulations, and some of those are around, like, identifying powerful content, and really it pushes the rep to try to de escalate, I guess, how it does it? It's really around how we set up the scenarios and and how they interact with it. And then a scorecard afterwards those teams will specify particular language those reps were supposed to use to de escalate, or we'll give them suggestions on kind of examples of language. But again, it's in the scorecard, and then on closing I guess it's sort of it's using the language models and the corporate information on the internet and all the kind of sales techniques to critique. So if you define like closing skills, it'll just use generic closing skills. It's seen online, whereas if you define exactly the closing criteria for your business, and you put that in the scorecard again, it'll it'll score based on that

S Speaker 231:07:43It's a CLI tool, so we type in code buff, but over one second or setting up. But so it's like one, one idea we have is basically, let's spend more money on more LLM calls and get you better results. So we we just have a higher priced subscription, and we just get more context on your code base, and we have customers who have tried all the tools, and then they like ours the best, because basically it's able to get better results in certain cases. Oh, here we go. So Brandon's already put in a prompt, basically, it says, Make a fish tank simulation for lots of fish and stuff.

S Speaker 231:08:28I think we'll start up the dev server, but just to give you guys a feel for what it what it can do. And then I think hopefully, once we have running, we can take some audience suggestions of like prompts that we can just put into it and see if

S Speaker 41:08:48we can get our result. Cool, quick show of hands. Who here has tried code buff?

we can get our result. Cool, quick show of hands. Who here has tried code buff?
S Speaker 231:08:56All right? Awesome. Yeah. It's kind of like, what was the nuance earlier, yeah, like she was using ADR, which is another tool, and I think ours is kind of like the combination of ADR and her tool, where it's like, yeah, we were in the wire. So there we go. It's going. So we asked it to create a fish tank simulation.
All right? Awesome. Yeah. It's kind of like, what was the nuance earlier, yeah, like she was using ADR, which is another tool, and I think ours is kind of like the combination of ADR and her tool, where it's like, yeah, we were in the wire.

S Speaker 231:09:25just running in the terminal. And then he's just adding another props, add a shark that chooses the first or the nearest fish, or whatever fish around. So while he's doing that, does anyone have a suggestion of what how to modify this like fish tank simulation, just a quick Like prompt. Anybody?
just running in the terminal. And then he's just adding another props, add a shark that chooses the first or the nearest fish, or whatever fish around. So while he's doing that, does anyone have a suggestion of what how to modify this like fish tank simulation, just a quick Like prompt. Anybody?

S Speaker 231:10:41cool, cool. Well, it looks like it edited into a type error, which it'll probably fix. So that's an interesting thing. So I figured out that there's
cool, cool. Well, it looks like it edited into a type error, which it'll probably fix. So that's an interesting thing. So I figured out that there's

something that's wrong
S Speaker 231:10:54and then to fix it. But one of the ways ours works differently is that a lot of one thing that we do differently than cursor is we actually use LMS in the file finding step. It's actually expensive, so they just do some like simple rag, which is like almost free, but we're actually using like, powerful models in that step, and that can get you better results. Okay, so, like, the goal, I think, is to not actually use a text editor anymore. I think it's like, that's where our vision differs from cursor. I think in like six months or a year, people will just, you'll still need some engineering knowledge, but you'll just be prompting, and it'll do the coding, like the actual coding. So I think, like, to me, that's pretty obvious where we're heading. So there's no need to use an editor at all, like, why even that's why we're building in the terminal, because you don't need, like, a fancy text editor all that. So are we adding a boat, or do we already, I don't know what we're adding, maybe we should take questions. Oh, let's
and then to fix it. But one of the ways ours works differently is that a lot of one thing that we do differently than cursor is we actually use LMS in the file finding step.

1:12:06do some questions.
S Speaker 241:12:10Yeah. How would you differentiate yourself from lovable? Would you also take prompts and building power software? Absolutely,
Yeah. How would you differentiate yourself from lovable? Would you also take prompts and building power software? Absolutely,
Yeah. How would you differentiate yourself from lovable? Would you also take prompts and building power software? Absolutely,
Yeah. How would you differentiate yourself from lovable? Would you also take prompts and building power software? Absolutely,
S Speaker 231:12:19that's a wonderful question so lovable, is designed to sort of host your like site in the web, and it does everything for you ours. You can drop the CLF in any existing code base, and so you can, sort of like, I feel like it's sort of a it's what separates like a sort of a toy, where you start building a project and then you can't really finish it there, because there's only so much you can do in the browser to like something where you could just like, use code bus, Code button like a giant code base, and it should work. So we're trying to build for software engineers that are doing

their day to day work. Yeah. Ken, you want to ask your pricing question. Ken,
S Speaker 151:12:58before you move on to that. Just want to show you like, this is how we use code buffs day to day. You know, we have, I use VS code, and I have in my terminal here, it just, kind of, you know, does its stuff, and then I'm kind of, like, monitoring the code changes that I see over here. So just want to point that out there.

S Speaker 251:13:21anyway, question, I've been using it for a couple months. A lot of these things I really like about it. One thing that I've noticed is that it will kind of run on past a mistake and kind of hurry through credit, which is a very unsettling feeling. But so one thing I have one question about that, which is, like, how can you sort of, like, control, what happens a little bit more sort of nuance, right? And the other is, have you thought about any kind

of, like, Git integration?
of, like, Git integration?
of, like, Git integration?
S Speaker 231:13:53Yeah, those are great questions. Yeah. Sometimes it gets carried away. One of the really interesting things about our project is that we don't have for permission to run any terminal command, and it's like, freaks some people out, but it's totally the future, and we have 80 customers, and they love it, and so it allows it to iterate. But as he's saying, sometimes it can get a little crazy where it's like, trying to fix the test, but it just can't fix it. It keeps iterating. So at the moment, requires a little bit of human oversight. But I think that this is just a limitation of the models. We can, like, we can hopefully try some things in the future, use better models and stuff to improve on that.

business, cards, customers?
business, cards, customers?
S Speaker 261:16:07Yes, exactly. So we built cofactory Because we are the leader in autonomous customer acquisition. So why don't we just kind of run through a demo real quick, awesome. So why don't we use, I don't know, cobuff, something you guys are kind of familiar with. This is basically just the setup of how we would sort of intake one of our new customers.
Yes, exactly. So we built cofactory Because we are the leader in autonomous customer acquisition. So why don't we just kind of run through a demo real quick, awesome. So why don't we use, I don't know, cobuff, something you guys are kind of familiar with. This is basically just the setup of how we would sort of intake one of our new customers.

S Speaker 271:16:41So this is the experience that code buff might have if they want to use our product, and we're just going to use our own booking link just for the sake of the demo.
So this is the experience that code buff might have if they want to use our product, and we're just going to use our own booking link just for the sake of the demo.
So this is the experience that code buff might have if they want to use our product, and we're just going to use our own booking link just for the sake of the demo.
So this is the experience that code buff might have if they want to use our product, and we're just going to use our own booking link just for the sake of the demo.
S Speaker 261:16:56Awesome. So what we've done is we've used code buff and gotten their website and used that for context to be able to build, essentially the initial marketing angle for what it is, what it's about, who the customers might be, things like that. So we're just adding a little bit more context here. What's the biggest differentiator? Awesome. So developers really enjoy seeing in their actual workflow the context that we need here. Yeah, what type of developer or team gets the most value from code buff? People will like terminals, cool, awesome. So as you can see, this is kind of getting more context and building all the information it will need to generate what we see next. So we have a summarization that we are generating right now that basically gives you kind of the one page on your company or your particular marketing angle. You can go in and you can edit that if you want. But yep, it's there we go. Cool. And now let me kind of talk through this next bit, because this is important. Generally, we recommend that people use a marketing URL. Part of the reason for that is security. Part of the reason for that is the product that we've ended up building is focused on being both AI search native and SEO native, right? So the ability to drive traffic to your site, to your product, whatever, through perplexity, through big AI search, you know, things like that, right? So let's, let's use trico.com for this. And the other important part is that it basically builds a larger footprint. So as you can see, we've spun up a landing page here. We'll go ahead and accept cookies. But what's unique about this landing page is not just that it's aI optimized, SEO optimized, whatever it is, but we also control it, so we have the ability to qualified customers who come in through this. So let's make up a Yeah, person comes in, they're searching for this, right? They sign up and cool. Now what we have is we start to get a little bit of context on these people. Who are they? Why are they searching? What do they want? What types of code base were they looking to automate, for example, and we're able to get that context because we pulled it directly from,
Awesome. So what we've done is we've used code buff and gotten their website and used that for context to be able to build, essentially the initial marketing angle for what it is, what it's about, who the customers might be, things like that.

Yeah, what type of developer or team gets the most value from code buff? People will like terminals, cool, awesome. So as you can see, this is kind of getting more context and building all the information it will need to generate what we see next. So we have a summarization that we are generating right now that basically gives you kind of the one page on your company or your particular marketing angle. You can go in and you can edit that if you want. But yep, it's there we go. Cool. And now let me kind of talk through this next bit, because this is important. Generally, we recommend that people use a marketing URL. Part of the reason for that is security. Part of the reason for that is the product that we've ended up building is focused on being both AI search native and SEO native, right? So the ability to drive traffic to your site, to your product, whatever, through perplexity, through big AI search, you know, things like that, right? So let's, let's use trico.com for this. And the other important part is that it basically builds a larger footprint. So as you can see, we've spun up a landing page here. We'll go ahead and accept cookies. But what's unique about this landing page is not just that it's aI optimized, SEO optimized, whatever it is, but we also control it, so we have the ability to qualified customers who come in through this. So let's make up a Yeah, person comes in, they're searching for this, right? They sign up and cool. Now what we have is we start to get a little bit of context on these people. Who are they? Why are they searching? What do they want? What types of code base were they looking to automate, for example, and we're able to get that context because we pulled it directly from,
Awesome.

S Speaker 261:19:46Basically, this is the job of, you know, your average SDR, right, calling and saying, like, Okay, what do you want? When do you want? It all that sort of stuff. So you can go through right here and book accounting link directly, which is kind of cool. And we filled out our own Calendly, so now we have a meeting on that. But yeah, should we go back to perfect? So as you can see, this is all built out. You can customize anything you want here. You can change the questions that are asked. You can change the design. That's all great, but this is the design department. This is what makes go back and go back. We have trained in AI to run hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of different ads. These ads are then right against each other to figure out which ones are the best. So we get the best headline and sub headline possible. So when somebody searches for anything, for example, intelligent code restructuring, right, we're going to take them to the best headline and sub headline that are performed for that, and then take them all the way through to a customized landing page that speaks exactly to that. So this results in dramatically higher conversion rates and in dramatically more relevant search results. So we like to think of it as putting the custom in customer. So what we would do is we go through and run the ads here real quick, but let us flip over to kind of the actual results. So we dog food our own product, so we get ourselves customers right here. But as you can see, we spent, I don't know, maybe a couple $1,000 I think, on this and gotten a ton of super relevant leads, and if we click on them, we can actually see, you know, the types of conversations that these people have. Why is this important? These are qualifying information right before the moment of conversion. So an incredibly valuable data set that allows us to get insight into why people are purchasing your product and basically does the whole job for it.

So you'll have, I don't know, the top 15, top 20 that are actually economically productive. This is really important because it allows you to customize all the language and each individual page for those journeys. We don't bring you the ones that aren't useful, but what we make sure is that you can customize any of the other stuff that you want. So so I'm

S Speaker 281:23:19just making sure everyone gets a turn. So then, in terms of, like, for example, that qualifying flow, can you see that? And then how much control do we have as that? And can we navigate that path for certain types of users that we're seeing?
just making sure everyone gets a turn. So then, in terms of, like, for example, that qualifying flow, can you see that? And then how much control do we have as that? And can we navigate that path for certain types of users that we're seeing?

S Speaker 261:23:33Yeah, so we are in the process of building out a full journey visualizer to allow you to see exactly what your customers are searching for? Yeah, we can show, I think, a little bit earlier. You have the ability, right now, when you click on the customer, to see what they search for specifically and their sort of journey, what they clicked on, what they're interested in, as well as the entire conversation that they had, you can even auto generate an email given that context, so you don't have to do anything. Our thought was like, hey, it really sucks to have to call these people and trying to get them to give them money. Let's just not do that. So

S Speaker 41:24:15how do I ask this? Okay, so when you're in the early stages of the product, it can be, like, it's usually not a good idea to automate this, this type of sales motion, versus doing foundry sales, where you actually get to ask, like, you get to look people in the eye, yeah, and figure out whether they actually want what you're building. Totally. Like, what? How do you navigate that? Like, why should early stage amazing,

S Speaker 261:24:55you have, you have, obviously, the service businesses, the SMBs, like, those work really well, but for our larger enterprise customers, for example, they just get a list of people who they can call, who they can throw into their system. That's not a problem either.

S Speaker 271:25:10Yeah. So we're obviously a up and coming, early stage business, and we're doing this right, and founder led stuff as well, but the amount of information that we've gained from literally these results and looking at them, we've changed the hearing was generation. We've realized what parts of the flow, what things basically, what people's expectations are at scale, right, without the bias of individual interviews and feedback. So, you

S Speaker 261:25:43know, to put it in marketing terms, I think a lot of people focus on Account Based Marketing like, Hey, we've got 10,000 people. If we target them very specifically, then our company is going to be a success. This is not a replacement necessarily, for that.
