S Speaker 20:43is right on awesome. I appreciate you. Connected through boardy. It was the first time I've used it, and I thought we, we've got people on our team who work with, worked with the boarding team in the past, and Andrew just, who's the founder there, and so, yeah, so we've got close ties to them, but at first, it was my first time actually using it, and I thought it was pretty cool.

S Speaker 11:04Yeah, I've recently started using it, and it seems like one of those right applications of AI just being there, omnipresent through all interactions. And I'm sort of evaluating this, but it seems like Brody gets really good when you keep sending it feedback about your cause and what worked, what did not, and things like that. So yeah, interested in how that evolves. But separately, Mark pleasure getting connected, I have a brief intro with what Bodhi said, and broadly, the space that you're working on in the stage that you are at works for us, fits our mandates and thesis we I'll give you a brief background about the fund quickly. About me. I'm a Senior Associate here, particularly focused on AI investments. I work directly with our Managing Director, and my focus areas are in AI applications, infra. Worked on six roughly a Id use in the last year and a half that I've been here with the fund, and prior to that, I've spent some time with Menlo Ventures and some time with Morpheus ventures in LA the fund itself has been around for 25 years, corporate venture arm of Qualcomm, so we invest out of the balance sheet. Typically aim to deploy about 100 $50 million a year in the Americas region. But it's a global fund, so we have offices across the globe. Toronto would would fall within our purview as well. And then check Sizes range anywhere from two to $15 million mark, very stage agnostic. We have recently started doing seed, so that's where, like, the shortest spectrum of $2 million comes in. And then we have done very late stage rounds of pre IPO as well. So the larger check sizes typically fit in there. We would not in. Say, most of our deals, we do not lead, we are a participant. And then sweet spot of check sizes would roughly fall five to 710, something like that.

S Speaker 16:03That's a great overview. Thanks a lot for that. Maybe if we can take a step back, we'd love to understand how the journey of the company has been. When did you start, and how many members are there in the team today?
That's a great overview. Thanks a lot for that. Maybe if we can take a step back, we'd love to understand how the journey of the company has been. When did you start, and how many members are there in the team today?

S Speaker 26:14Yeah. So we did our first, let's say like our first pre seed round in 2021 that was when we first really got got got started. We're about 41 people in the company now.
Yeah. So we did our first, let's say like our first pre seed round in 2021 that was when we first really got got got started. We're about 41 people in the company now.
Yeah. So we did our first, let's say like our first pre seed round in 2021 that was when we first really got got got started. We're about 41 people in the company now.
Yeah. So we did our first, let's say like our first pre seed round in 2021 that was when we first really got got got started. We're about 41 people in the company now.
S Speaker 16:27Yeah, got it, got it. And you said 1 million, you started with 1 million this year. And that's an incredible growth year for you. For sure. What changed? Mark, how, like, what was the inflection point in the entire journey?
Yeah, got it, got it. And you said 1 million, you started with 1 million this year. And that's an incredible growth year for you. For sure. What changed? Mark, how, like, what was the inflection point in the entire journey?
Yeah, got it, got it. And you said 1 million, you started with 1 million this year. And that's an incredible growth year for you. For sure. What changed? Mark, how, like, what was the inflection point in the entire journey?

S Speaker 26:43Yeah, it was really, it was this single tenant, private cloud implementation model. I think now we're seeing, you know, a lot of these, these law firms now are recognizing the tension with like a Harvey and lagora, where Harvey's, you know, marketing, more and more that they're working with Walmart legal team, right? And that Harvey is, is tackling that and attacking the $2 billion legal spend of a Walmart, right? Well, this is the law firms. A lot of this $2 billion is going to the law firm right now and and so I think law firms are recognizing this tension between vendors, between Harvey lagora, others, and working more and more to say, Okay, we need a dedicated environment. We need our own platform that we can invest in and and the value of those investments are creative to us, where we can build proprietary assets. We don't want to just be fueling Harvey lagora to to then go off and compete against us directly with our clients.
Yeah, it was really, it was this single tenant, private cloud implementation model.

S Speaker 28:22Yeah, well, so the big thing is we do have this single tenant implementation. But what that enables is we don't need a partnership with a third party vendor to do an integration. If a law firm has an API key to another tool that they use, we integrate it into their single tenant environment and and so now law firms can have conversational interface to every single tool that they use in their firm that they have an API key for. So that's a big difference with for us, compared to multi tenant applications like Harvey lagora others you can't, you can't do those integrations. So easily. And then what this also allows, like, the integrations are super important, but it enables, it enables comprehensive workflow automation. So this is like chaining together dozens, some cases, hundreds, of prompts that interact with different tools that do different things to complete, you know, end to end tasks that lawyers might oversee, or teams within a law firm might oversee and and so this is yeah, so legal research, document analysis, generating chronologies, drafting documents. You know, we can we generate 100 page Word documents. These are complex workflow automations that draft these, these complex, highly technical documents that lawyers then can take and and
Yeah, well, so the big thing is we do have this single tenant implementation. But what that enables is we don't need a partnership with a third party vendor to do an integration.

S Speaker 19:52they can to that I understand that Mark, let's say for for easier segmentation, let's call the single tenant deployment as one of the edges you have around go to market from a product perspective, say, how do you compare against the likes of Harvey? What I am failing to come with a benchmark. But what would be a right benchmark in this industry to compare, say, Alexi against Harvey or lagora and say, are the same? Are these using the same workflow automation, user journeys. The user journeys are same.

S Speaker 210:26Are it's very similar. And it's not like we struggle to identify anything that any other company does that we cannot easily build, like the functionalities, these capabilities, these workflow automation. There's this is not what's what's where anybody should be competing on it certainly not where we were market leading. And there's been research studies on the various tools, and we're right at the top on, on, on these studies for the basic capabilities for law firms. But, but again, that's not where we compete. It's so easy for people to provide this capability, you know, doing document analysis, generating summaries of documents, generating chronologies, extracting all the entities of a particular litigation or an M and A transaction, you know, and similar things to like, what heavier does, and the complex table generation. Mean, these are all. These are all fairly basic capabilities that a lot of companies can do, and it's not where it's not where we compete, it's not where anybody really competes.

S Speaker 111:32So Mark, how is this industry sort of evolving, just in your perspective, and you're the best person to sort of talk about it, right? If you if you say technical capabilities are fairly standard and and I buy that point, right? I understand technical capabilities could be fairly standard and could be not the differentiating factors amongst some of these companies. How do you see this market evolve? How do you see clients select between different companies, different vendors, if, say, just the deployment mode is not the biggest differentiator,
So Mark, how is this industry sort of evolving, just in your perspective, and you're the best person to sort of talk about it, right?

S Speaker 212:09sure, I think, Well, I think it is. It is pretty clear. It is the vendor that best enables law firms to

S Speaker 114:24Mark, yeah, that totally is fair statement. Mark, would you have say a product demo that we can go through together? Would love to see visuals and understand what the products capable of today, how some customers are using it? Yeah, absolutely, just log in. Yeah,
Mark, yeah, that totally is fair statement. Mark, would you have say a product demo that we can go through together? Would love to see visuals and understand what the products capable of today, how some customers are using it? Yeah, absolutely, just log in. Yeah,

well, that's a tight calendar.
S Speaker 115:12Yes, sorry about that. No, that's okay. Do you see the calendar or the product? I see the product now, yes,

S Speaker 215:21okay, awesome, cool. So, yeah, this is the, yeah, this is the it's fairly straightforward. We've got various integrations to connectors. So I manage it's, it's the number one document management system for amla, 100 net documents, others that we can connect, integrate users can upload documents, 1000s of documents here, and then there's, yeah, lots of lots of functionality, capability that you can engage with documents, engage with open open Research. You can tell me about leading anti competition aces,
okay, awesome, cool. So, yeah, this is the, yeah, this is the it's fairly straightforward. We've got various integrations to connectors. So I manage it's, it's the number one document management system for amla, 100 net documents, others that we can connect, integrate users can upload documents, 1000s of documents here, and then there's, yeah, lots of lots of functionality, capability that you can engage with documents, engage with open open Research.

S Speaker 216:11and then it provides so we rely on various tools. But, I mean, this wouldn't really be a legal research question, but it's just kind of an open domain question, but there's legal research questions that you can you can only get if you have access to a comprehensive primary law, case law database. So here's, here's an example of what an answer like that looks like. You can click on the cases. You can view all the cases and and, yeah, there's Yeah, and lots of basic capabilities here. There's the workflows so really powerful workflows that you can, you know, view these workflows, and they do lots of different capabilities, you know, building chronologies, yeah, reviewing various agreements, reviewing purchase sale agreements. And then when you, when you want to interact with these, these workflows. So you can, you can say something like, run the build a chronology, and I can, click on this and then on the uploaded docs. I haven't actually uploaded any documents, so it'll likely tell me that.
and then it provides so we rely on various tools.

S Speaker 117:32But and how does the workflow look for the building the workflow piece, Mark, say, what can we? Can we go through one of the complex workflows, the tools that cause the data it integrates with, and say, essentially, if the output is drafting something that would, that would be a good demo to go through.

S Speaker 217:57Sure, yeah, so I'd have to, I mean, with with a bit more notice, I could, I could pull up a matter here that has loaded with all the documents I don't have that right now. No worries. Show you what, what, what one of them would would look like here. Let me go back to the workflow here. And so I mean any of these workflows here you can see that this one's a fairly simple one. There's only there's only two, but you can see it passes variables from step to step. So this is the output right here, and then this is the name of the this first step. And so this step, the prompt is basically very simple. Extract the needed information in the term sheet, and then it takes the needed information, and then it now takes it here, this is the data, and then this is the next prompt, and and so then it revises an uploaded precedent, upload a document to reflect the term sheet. And then this, this workflow, is drafting a loan agreement from a term sheet, yeah, and and so, and then, yeah, and if you wanted to build your own workflow, let's see create new workflow. It's a, it's exactly like this. So you just fill out various steps. So I got to fill out the sono. I don't and you can, you can just add as many of these steps as you want, and the outputs a variable, and then you can reference that variable in any other workflow, and and then so our customers, they're building, you know, they're chaining dozens of these tasks together. They do very complex things, starting with, okay, research, research, this, this issue, legal issue. Understand what the key cases are. Look through the documents for these facts. Summarize these facts. Draft. This the pleading, or draft this letter, and then all of this now, now the user just logs in says, oh, I need to draft a letter on this issue and and then it goes, it knows it needs to go and do all these things first. And then the lawyer gets back a letter within
Sure, yeah, so I'd have to, I mean, with with a bit more notice, I could, I could pull up a matter here that has loaded with all the documents I don't have that right now. No worries.

19:57five or six minutes. Yeah.
five or six minutes. Yeah.
five or six minutes. Yeah.
five or six minutes. Yeah.
S Speaker 120:00Makes sense. Interesting, interesting mark. Agree on that. What's your thought on? Say, again, coming from a point that I haven't spoken to a lot of say, legal, AI companies so far. What's your point on the fact that some of these companies have higher traction, are much up ahead? Maybe started earlier, and hence may have more data to tune their systems. Do you see that as a competition blocker for you,

S Speaker 122:36Yeah, got it. Got it. Marx was super interesting. We'd love to dig deeper. Fits, fits, a lot of check boxes. And are you raising around currently? And how big around Are you raising? If so,
Yeah, got it. Got it. Marx was super interesting. We'd love to dig deeper. Fits, fits, a lot of check boxes. And are you raising around currently? And how big around Are you raising? If so,
Yeah, got it. Got it. Marx was super interesting. We'd love to dig deeper. Fits, fits, a lot of check boxes. And are you raising around currently? And how big around Are you raising? If so,
Yeah, got it. Got it. Marx was super interesting. We'd love to dig deeper. Fits, fits, a lot of check boxes. And are you raising around currently? And how big around Are you raising? If so,
S Speaker 222:50yeah, early, early next year. Is, is, is the plan? Yeah. And we're, we're, yeah, not. We haven't totally settled on size of the round, yeah? Like what we'll be looking to do. We did a Series A, we did a $10 million Series A, about a year and a half ago, okay? And then a year ago, we did a small 5 million extension, and basically the same valuation. And so now we'd be, yeah, we probably in the 2020, to 30 million range is what we'd be looking
yeah, early, early next year. Is, is, is the plan? Yeah. And we're, we're, yeah, not. We haven't totally settled on size of the round, yeah? Like what we'll be looking to do. We did a Series A, we did a $10 million Series A, about a year and a half ago, okay? And then a year ago, we did a small 5 million extension, and basically the same valuation.

And so now we'd be, yeah, we probably in the 2020, to 30 million range is what we'd be looking
23:22to raise Fair, fair mark. That's that's
to raise Fair, fair mark. That's that's
to raise Fair, fair mark. That's that's
to raise Fair, fair mark. That's that's
S Speaker 123:26fits in our sweet spot. So that works for sure. And early next year, so you buy then you expect to be at, you're currently at 5 million, and by then you expect to be at what levels of traction?
fits in our sweet spot. So that works for sure. And early next year, so you buy then you expect to be at, you're currently at 5 million, and by then you expect to be at what levels of traction?
fits in our sweet spot. So that works for sure. And early next year, so you buy then you expect to be at, you're currently at 5 million, and by then you expect to be at what levels of traction?

S Speaker 223:41Yeah, by, by the end of q1 I think we'll there's a great chance we'll be at 10 million. That's what we're targeting for, for, yeah, March,
Yeah, by, by the end of q1 I think we'll there's a great chance we'll be at 10 million. That's what we're targeting for, for, yeah, March,
