S Speaker 22:24okay, I'll just, I'll just do it like this. I can switch around. So, okay, so, you know, I think actually the business model has evolved since we first met. You know, we've gotten to be the knees are focused on just being in the middle of this biometric identity and payment network. And so, you know, the model is built around leverage, leverage with partnerships on the consumer side, where these big brands go out and enroll 10s of millions of consumers to do either face or palm and then on the merchant side, we have these big partnerships with payment terminal companies, pos companies, PS companies, where they go into the marketplace and basically sell integrated solutions, retrofit modules, to merchants. And so for us, the model has become incredibly capital efficient as we planned it out in that we make a piece of software that sits on all these acceptance devices, either as a retrofit or embedded, and connects into all these different consumer services that accept biometrics via a license from us. So I think, you know, it's really very much a business model built around visa. I've studied the visa business model, incredibly compelling when you can almost do nothing and command a half a trillion dollar market cap by sitting in the middle, creating standards around the technology, the rules for how the disputes work, and basically just licensing both sides of the marketplace to go distribute to consumers. Emergence. So that's where we've ended up, and I think in a lot of ways, you know, in that world, Qualcomm is pretty much completely aligned with us, right, in that, you know, Qualcomm will be Switzerland and work with all these different consumer services, whether it's JP Morgan or Amazon one or, you know, now we're, we're doing work With, with the one app at Walmart and Capital One and groups like that, or on the acceptance side, you know, working with Verifone and Jenica through Chiba, NCR, all the different acceptance companies. So that's sort of that the high level, high level business model, and we can actually walk through like the specific ways that gets implemented, and the different money flows, because in some cases, money is flowing from the left side, these consumer payment services, in some cases flowing from the right side, and in some cases, we're sharing with different partners. But let me stop there any any sort of questions on on the vision and plan,

S Speaker 15:04John, maybe just quickly before we get into the guts of this. Maybe just talk a little bit about the team, unless you were planning to cover it later. And why did you get into this business? Yeah,

S Speaker 25:14so, good point. Okay, so sort of the background I've been investing in restaurant and retail tech for like 13 years now. So made a lot of investments in real estate restaurants and things like automation of restaurants. The Qualcomm team had seen some of some of the investments we made in Los Angeles, for example, in robotics. About seven years ago, we actually put self ordering kiosks in our own restaurants in an attempt to reduce labor costs, and most of the rest of the industry has done that. Now, the problem we found is that it took people a lot longer to order on the kiosk in our restaurants than it took them to order at the counter when there was a person to walk them through the menu and ring up the order. So the very simple idea, this is like 2017 was attach a camera to the kiosk, let the consumer push a button to remember me with face ID at the end of their first order, and when they come back the next time, they could check in with face ID, just like on their iPhone, it would pull up their favorite orders from the past. It would pull up their loyalty without having to do a QR code, they could repeat the order, get an upsell, and then scan their fates again to pay. And so we actually started the business in our own restaurants, just as a product, and we got great data, so people loved it. Ticket size went up by like four and a half percent. Throughput went way up because people just quickly checked in and checked out loyalty, engagement went way up. And then we started doing payments outside the card network to lower our payment processing fees. So we got all this great data in our own restaurants for about 18 months. And then we decided, okay, there is a opportunity here, based on what we've learned doing it ourselves, to build a platform that is equivalent to Apple Pay, where you enroll one time and everywhere you go, instead of pulling out your phone to do loyalty and your phone to do payment, you just scan your face or your palm to do both loyalty and payment. And so so we, from that, capitalized the company and basically funded ourselves to date. So this is the first sort of real institutional round we're doing. So it's a story that starts with us as a owner of restaurants, actually building the technology ourselves and getting our own data before we took it on the market. Big thing that this is driven by, really, is Apple Pay. So everybody's scared of Apple Pay, retailers, issuing banks because they have to pay 15 basis points, big financial institutions like like Visa, all concerned about how much control Apple Pay will have of the payment system is people increasingly use NFC for tap to pay instead of instead of cards, and so I think in a lot of cases, what we're going in and pitching our partners on the consumer side, like JP Morgan, like PayPal, discussions we're having with PayPal, like Capital One is, hey, this is an opportunity To create a new authentication mechanism outside of Apple's control, where you know you're not dependent on the consumer having a piece of hardware to do payment. So the face and the palm enable new ways to do authentication and payment where Apple doesn't have control the identity and payment system. So that's a huge part of our story right now, driving a lot of our our deals in the market is, is the fear of Apple Pay, and it's, it's growing dominance, the revenue that Apple generates. I met with Eddie cube a few months ago. Socially, he's in charge of Apple services, and he said, Apple Pay is there, becoming their most profitable part of their business. They don't do anything. They authenticate and make 15 basis points on every transaction, and they really don't have any liability or risk. So they, I think, will continue to, you know, focus on building the Apple Pay products. And I think probably in the long run, our vision is that if we're successful, our core product, which is this biometric switch that ties into all these acceptance machines and routes to these different consumer services, will have an Apple Pay biometrics option on it, and so you can keep your phone in your pocket. You can click Apple Pay biometrics on a Verifone terminal. You can take your picture, and that payment gets routed to Apple Pay without the use of NFC. I went through that with Eddie. He said he loves it, and come back to him, and we've got a scale on the acceptance site to talk about it. Next slide is around the opportunity to actually start moving money outside of the card network. So a lot of what we've done to date is thinking about how we can move money from bank to bank with a whole new dispute resolution system built around biometrics. And so our view at this point is that people probably won't switch from a credit card to a pay by Bank Rail, but people will switch, and we've shown this with lots and lots of data over the last six years, from a debit card to a pay by Bank Rail. So a college student that has no problem using biometrics to authenticate and pay is also very familiar with linking their bank account through something like plaid to a service and having money taken directly out of their bank account. They see no difference between that and using a debit card. And so our view is that globally, this is happening in places like India with UPI and places like Brazil with fix all over the world, we're seeing central banks starting to say, Hey, why do we need the card network, particularly for debit cards, we should license up eyes technology, build our own pay by bank domestic rail and basically tell a Visa MasterCard to go home. We also see this happening in the US. And in fact, a big part of our partnership with JP Morgan is distributing a JP Morgan branded pay by bake product into the marketplace where, you know, there will be a lot of trust, and you know, JP Morgan can leverage its its baking power, to start to move money outside the cart network. We have tons of data, so we're the only ones that were crazy enough to start doing biometric payments six years ago in America, I think we're the only ones doing it today with, like, substantial amounts of data. Amazon would be the other one with their POM scam product. And so we have millions and millions of biometric loyalty check ins. We have millions and millions of biometric payment transactions. And so we've really shown that over the years, people use biometrics. They've become increasingly comfortable with it. They enroll, they start using it once twice, and they use it over and over again. And we've got really incredible data in some of our customers, like deli time, where there's, like, consistently, 20% plus of the total transactions in the stores are biometric versus card or phone based and based on all this data. We've gone into a number of big chains, and we've had some initial full rollouts. Stake in shape. Now Every store has biometric loyalty and payment inside of the stores, about 400 locations. Now we're in the process of adding drive through so that you can do the biometric and check in, biometric check in and payment at the order confirmation screen in the drive through. We have a deal with Whataburger where we've fully proven out all these benefits in a handful of stores, and they're planning a full rollout this year to all 1000 stores, and we've got a pretty substantial pipeline of customers. Everything from Walmart will be all day Friday of this week to the big fast food brands like McDonald's, a lot of those deals are driven by our partners selling so this is JP Morgan Merchant Services team. This is verifones team. This is Toshiba's sales team. So most of the distribution on the merchant side is through partners that have sales people that are out selling an integrated solution. We
so, good point. Okay, so sort of the background I've been investing in restaurant and retail tech for like 13 years now.

Amazon would be the other one with their POM scam product. And so we have millions and millions of biometric loyalty check ins. We have millions and millions of biometric payment transactions. And so we've really shown that over the years, people use biometrics. They've become increasingly comfortable with it. They enroll, they start using it once twice, and they use it over and over again. And we've got really incredible data in some of our customers, like deli time, where there's, like, consistently, 20% plus of the total transactions in the stores are biometric versus card or phone based and based on all this data. We've gone into a number of big chains, and we've had some initial full rollouts. Stake in shape. Now Every store has biometric loyalty and payment inside of the stores, about 400 locations. Now we're in the process of adding drive through so that you can do the biometric and check in, biometric check in and payment at the order confirmation screen in the drive through. We have a deal with Whataburger where we've fully proven out all these benefits in a handful of stores, and they're planning a full rollout this year to all 1000 stores, and we've got a pretty substantial pipeline of customers. Everything from Walmart will be all day Friday of this week to the big fast food brands like McDonald's, a lot of those deals are driven by our partners selling so this is JP Morgan Merchant Services team. This is verifones team. This is Toshiba's sales team. So most of the distribution on the merchant side is through partners that have sales people that are out selling an integrated solution. We
so, good point. Okay, so sort of the background I've been investing in restaurant and retail tech for like 13 years now. So made a lot of investments in real estate restaurants and things like automation of restaurants. The Qualcomm team had seen some of some of the investments we made in Los Angeles, for example, in robotics. About seven years ago, we actually put self ordering kiosks in our own restaurants in an attempt to reduce labor costs, and most of the rest of the industry has done that. Now, the problem we found is that it took people a lot longer to order on the kiosk in our restaurants than it took them to order at the counter when there was a person to walk them through the menu and ring up the order. So the very simple idea, this is like 2017 was attach a camera to the kiosk, let the consumer push a button to remember me with face ID at the end of their first order, and when they come back the next time, they could check in with face ID, just like on their iPhone, it would pull up their favorite orders from the past. It would pull up their loyalty without having to do a QR code, they could repeat the order, get an upsell, and then scan their fates again to pay. And so we actually started the business in our own restaurants, just as a product, and we got great data, so people loved it. Ticket size went up by like four and a half percent. Throughput went way up because people just quickly checked in and checked out loyalty, engagement went way up. And then we started doing payments outside the card network to lower our payment processing fees. So we got all this great data in our own restaurants for about 18 months. And then we decided, okay, there is a opportunity here, based on what we've learned doing it ourselves, to build a platform that is equivalent to Apple Pay, where you enroll one time and everywhere you go, instead of pulling out your phone to do loyalty and your phone to do payment, you just scan your face or your palm to do both loyalty and payment. And so so we, from that, capitalized the company and basically funded ourselves to date. So this is the first sort of real institutional round we're doing. So it's a story that starts with us as a owner of restaurants, actually building the technology ourselves and getting our own data before we took it on the market. Big thing that this is driven by, really, is Apple Pay. So everybody's scared of Apple Pay, retailers, issuing banks because they have to pay 15 basis points, big financial institutions like like Visa, all concerned about how much control Apple Pay will have of the payment system is people increasingly use NFC for tap to pay instead of instead of cards, and so I think in a lot of cases, what we're going in and pitching our partners on the consumer side, like JP Morgan, like PayPal, discussions we're having with PayPal, like Capital One is, hey, this is an opportunity To create a new authentication mechanism outside of Apple's control, where you know you're not dependent on the consumer having a piece of hardware to do payment. So the face and the palm enable new ways to do authentication and payment where Apple doesn't have control the identity and payment system. So that's a huge part of our story right now, driving a lot of our our deals in the market is, is the fear of Apple Pay, and it's, it's growing dominance, the revenue that Apple generates. I met with Eddie cube a few months ago. Socially, he's in charge of Apple services, and he said, Apple Pay is there, becoming their most profitable part of their business. They don't do anything. They authenticate and make 15 basis points on every transaction, and they really don't have any liability or risk. So they, I think, will continue to, you know, focus on building the Apple Pay products. And I think probably in the long run, our vision is that if we're successful, our core product, which is this biometric switch that ties into all these acceptance machines and routes to these different consumer services, will have an Apple Pay biometrics option on it, and so you can keep your phone in your pocket. You can click Apple Pay biometrics on a Verifone terminal. You can take your picture, and that payment gets routed to Apple Pay without the use of NFC. I went through that with Eddie. He said he loves it, and come back to him, and we've got a scale on the acceptance site to talk about it. Next slide is around the opportunity to actually start moving money outside of the card network. So a lot of what we've done to date is thinking about how we can move money from bank to bank with a whole new dispute resolution system built around biometrics. And so our view at this point is that people probably won't switch from a credit card to a pay by Bank Rail, but people will switch, and we've shown this with lots and lots of data over the last six years, from a debit card to a pay by Bank Rail. So a college student that has no problem using biometrics to authenticate and pay is also very familiar with linking their bank account through something like plaid to a service and having money taken directly out of their bank account. They see no difference between that and using a debit card. And so our view is that globally, this is happening in places like India with UPI and places like Brazil with fix all over the world, we're seeing central banks starting to say, Hey, why do we need the card network, particularly for debit cards, we should license up eyes technology, build our own pay by bank domestic rail and basically tell a Visa MasterCard to go home. We also see this happening in the US. And in fact, a big part of our partnership with JP Morgan is distributing a JP Morgan branded pay by bake product into the marketplace where, you know, there will be a lot of trust, and you know, JP Morgan can leverage its its baking power, to start to move money outside the cart network. We have tons of data, so we're the only ones that were crazy enough to start doing biometric payments six years ago in America, I think we're the only ones doing it today with, like, substantial amounts of data. Amazon would be the other one with their POM scam product. And so we have millions and millions of biometric loyalty check ins. We have millions and millions of biometric payment transactions. And so we've really shown that over the years, people use biometrics. They've become increasingly comfortable with it. They enroll, they start using it once twice, and they use it over and over again. And we've got really incredible data in some of our customers, like deli time, where there's, like, consistently, 20% plus of the total transactions in the stores are biometric versus card or phone based and based on all this data.

This is verifones team. This is Toshiba's sales team. So most of the distribution on the merchant side is through partners that have sales people that are out selling an integrated solution. We
S Speaker 213:35can run you through all the data, but we've gone through this with Catal and various people Qualcomm, but we've shown consistently that when people do have access to biometric check in, things go substantially faster. There's an increase in ticket size for about four and a half percent, because QSR chains and other retailers can do very personalized, targeted upsells. There's increased loyalty engagement, and as I mentioned, a big part of what we've done is use the biometrics to move money outside of the Visa, MasterCard network, so we've been able to lower fees for these big merchants. And John, you mentioned on the previous slide that Apple Pay can't use ACH rails. What? What's the reason behind that? Well, they could, in theory, they don't today, right? If you, if you, if you enroll in Apple Pay, it's a, it's a card based system that they tokenize the card and pass the network token around. I think there is certainly a case to be made that, you know, Apple will look at this. If it becomes popular. I will tell you, when I met Eddie, I asked him about sort of the International, you know, picks and UPI, and why they don't allow those services, which are QR code based to use NFC. And he said they're looking at it, but, you know, didn't sound like there was anything in the immediate, near term. So I think one of the, you know, internationally, one of the big selling propositions. And our strategy internationally is to just license central banks to implement our technology is, you know, it's a better way to do domestic switches and schemes than QR codes. And we basically can convince anybody of that with all of our data. And if you've been any of those places like Brazil, like pix is like 15 seconds to deal with the QR code authentication. So, so we actually see, and we, you know, we've talked to the Qualcomm team about this, all kinds of discussions going on internationally with central banks that are going to say, Okay, we're going to push biometrics from the top and link it to our domestic scheme, because it's more secure than QR code, and it's more efficient than QR code. So yeah, Apple could do these bank to bank rails. At the moment, it doesn't sound like they have any plans. Next slide. These are some of our customers I talked about. And again, the idea is that the enrollment takes place in their mobile apps. So in the Whataburger mobile app, you get a message that says you no longer have to pull out your phone at Whataburger keep your phone in your phone in your pocket. You can do a face or palm scan for loyalty and payment. We've done. We have some great data from care for which is our first grocer in the they launched in the Middle East, and we're using that data having all these discussions with groceries in the US, like Kroger and Walmart and so these are our kind of focus areas, Fast Food and Grocery, the two initial markets that we're going after, but the merchant services teams at Verifone and JP Morgan and the different acceptance side distributors are going out to retailers broadly. So we had lots of discussions with, you know, at NRF with Costco and Home Depot and all the big retailers, our first consumer platform where, you know, we have licensed our technology, the whole thing, and tied it into our biometric switch that sits on a quantum chip in an acceptance machine. Is JP Morgan Chase. So you know that deal is now finalized. It took us almost two years to get the whole thing done. They've been in the market for us. We kind of look at our businesses like if nothing else ever happens, if only this happens and they do what they say they're going to do. You know, we've got upfront fees, we've got monthly fees. We've got for check in fees every time someone does a biometric car transaction. JP, Morgan pays us every time there's a biometric pay by bank transaction pays us so if we just deliver our technology as agreed and let them go do the hard work, both on the merchant side, with their merchants and also through their issuing bank and their various channels into consumers, you know that's a meaningful business. And we've shown you guys a model which assumes we only do that and nothing else. And you know, that gets us to a meaningful amount of revenue by 2029 so that's sort of like our very conservative base case that's been done years of hard work and huge investment, and they're taking that to market pretty aggressively. They've got about 30 people on the biometrics team now, and you know, I think Qualcomm is familiar with this, because Qualcomm has supported the payment terminals we built with JP Morgan, and a lot of the, a lot of the deep security infrastructure we put in place around the biometrics our more aggressive, broader vision is to host multiple platforms on the switch. So we're in discussions with services like PayPal, where we'll do similar to JP Morgan license PayPal the biometric technology. So there's now a PayPal biometrics where PayPal is responsible for enrolling the consumer through their app. They're responsible for doing some sales to merchants that they work with, and then our acceptance partners, like Verifone and Toshiba and NCR will go out and distribute the biometric switch that contains an option for the merchant to accept Paypal. We have a discussion going on with clear where they have 30 million consumers, and they're interested in adding payment and connecting into our switch. We have a discussion with Amazon, which the Qualcomm team is involved in, about putting Amazon one on our switch. And so the vision is that, just like cap to pay, you go up and hold up your phone and it routes to Samsung Pay or Apple Pay. There will be several biometric consumer services. We license our technology to all of them. They pay us for those licenses and basis points and loyalty fees and license fees. And then on the acceptance side, when a consumer walks into the CVS or the Kroger, you just walk up and scan your face or palm and the transaction gets automatically routed to the consumer service through our switch without the consumer having to push a button. We show the buttons here, just to kind of make it clear how we're switching, but the plan that we've architected is it's all interoperable. So I just like, I tap my phone, I scan my face, I scan my palm. I do that either on a retrofit module or on a terminal that has the biometrics embedded, and the transaction gets routed to the service I'm in. If I'm in multiple services, it asks me which one I want to use, and that becomes the standard way to do loyalty and payment without consumers pulling out their phone number. Can
can run you through all the data, but we've gone through this with Catal and various people Qualcomm, but we've shown consistently that when people do have access to biometric check in, things go substantially faster. There's an increase in ticket size for about four and a half percent, because QSR chains and other retailers can do very personalized, targeted upsells.

And so the vision is that, just like cap to pay, you go up and hold up your phone and it routes to Samsung Pay or Apple Pay. There will be several biometric consumer services. We license our technology to all of them. They pay us for those licenses and basis points and loyalty fees and license fees. And then on the acceptance side, when a consumer walks into the CVS or the Kroger, you just walk up and scan your face or palm and the transaction gets automatically routed to the consumer service through our switch without the consumer having to push a button. We show the buttons here, just to kind of make it clear how we're switching, but the plan that we've architected is it's all interoperable. So I just like, I tap my phone, I scan my face, I scan my palm. I do that either on a retrofit module or on a terminal that has the biometrics embedded, and the transaction gets routed to the service I'm in. If I'm in multiple services, it asks me which one I want to use, and that becomes the standard way to do loyalty and payment without consumers pulling out their phone number. Can
S Speaker 120:13my credentials be used in stake and shake or have to enroll multiple times? So you
my credentials be used in stake and shake or have to enroll multiple times? So you
my credentials be used in stake and shake or have to enroll multiple times? So you
my credentials be used in stake and shake or have to enroll multiple times? So you
S Speaker 220:19enroll once in that service, which is, that's the initial service we power, which is JP Morgan, biometric identity payment service you enroll in the water burger, out everywhere else, several 100 other small businesses that we put the acceptance system into. So the idea is, like today, the merchant, if they're accepting tap to pay, they accept Apple Pay, and they accept Samsung Pay, and maybe, you know, Google Pay, the vision is that when we go sell biometric payment to all these merchants, they're just checking a box. Yeah, I'll accept the JP Morgan biometric service. I'll accept the PayPal biometric service, and it all comes into package. And so the goal is that, you know, regardless of which biometric service you're in, everywhere you go, it's interoperable, and it works. This model is, you know, we modeled out separately. Is a more aggressive model. I think this gets us to, like, over $40 million in 2029 obviously, you know, this is what we really want to get to, which is, you know, every person has a biometric Identity account, and basically every place you can go to use it, both in the physical world and even in the digital world. And we're making basis points on every transaction, whether CB Morgan or, you know, clear pay or PayPal biometrics. So this is really where, you know, this is what we want to do, but we kind of modeled out both scenarios for base case and more aggressive case.

So we can run through, we can run through those spreadsheets,
S Speaker 124:51yeah, I think just yeah, not row by row, but just high level pictures. And before we get there. So as of now, you have 400 400 steak and shake on rollout, and then you have Whataburger and care for. Those are the three actual customers. Well,

S Speaker 225:12we've got, we've probably got a couple 100 small businesses that have somewhere between, like one store and like maybe 15 stores. Like deli time has got 15 stores. And whereas, like, you know, there's a place down the street from me, a coffee shop, that's one store, I go to it every day. So, yeah, I mean, the big chains that were that we've implemented with steak and shake Whataburger care for we are. We've, JP, Morgan has signed deals with a bunch of others that are being implemented now, obviously Chase Center in San Francisco will be fully biometric. That's that was their first one. Their second one is Delaware North, which is a food service manager from corporate cafeterias and stadiums, pretty big acceptance. They've got deal discussions going on with Starbucks and and Aramark and a bunch of other retailers, verifones got their own pipeline.

do I have to be a chase customer?
S Speaker 226:51No, you can. It's built like Apple pig so, so you can use any card. But you know, part of our concern about this business is that people will believe that, in fact, I've sat in that Chase makes a big deal of marketing this at Chase Center in San Francisco. The first question people say is just what you said, Do I have to be have a chase card? And the answer is no, but our vision of how this really rolls out, and our Frank, I wouldn't say this in front of JP Morgan team, but our view is that they'll do some damage in terms of, you know, getting a bunch of merchants signed up. They obviously have 60 million consumers in their mobile banking app. They can get them to sign up, but for, like, massive acceptance, where it's, like, everywhere you go, we have to do these other deals. We need PayPal, and we need, you know, the other Capital One. There's a discussion going on. So we need multiple consumer services that are branded pushing this to the market to get everybody using it. Because there's people just say, Hey, I don't like Chase or I don't have a chase card, you know, not bother with it.

S Speaker 327:53So still trying to figure out the consumer like onboarding experience, let's say I go to one of these locations where you have this service. From a user standpoint, what do I have to do in order to use the service like, you know, Apple Pay. I just load my credit card into the wallet right then I just go to machines. Very easy sort of thing. But in this case, what do I have to do specifically from a user standpoint? So

S Speaker 228:23the ideal experience for the consumer is it's done at home in the mobile app. So like Whataburger, they have 8 million people in their mobile app doing loyalty. So they ping everybody at home where they've launched it geolocated, and say, Hey, you get a message in your app that pops up on your phone that says, hey, notification. Whataburger is now offering phone free loyalty payment. Click here to enroll, and then you click in the Whataburger mobile app and you take your picture. Historically, we've only done face. We're just now adding palm so you can take your picture of your face or your palm on your phone. And now you're you've created a JP Morgan account. In the future, maybe you can use either JP Morgan or PayPal, right choose which one you want to use at Whataburger. So you've created a JP Morgan biometric account that's linked to the Whataburger loyalty and then you add, you know, a debit or credit card, or do pay by bank. They will encourage you to do pay by bank because their fee is substantially lower. And in that case, there's an iframe that pops up. And again, those of us that are older are used to this, but like my kids, see it all the time, they they connect their their their bank account, just with a easy kind of connection to their mobile banking app. And okay, it's done. When you go into the store, you're already enrolled. You walk up and you check in on the kiosk or the drive through at the counter, and you see your loyalty and you do your payment.

You can also just go to like JP Morgan biometrics.com and enroll JP Morgan, would say most of their enrollments will come to the Chase Mobile Banking App. So like in your Chase, they've got 50, 60 million people in the Chase Mobile Banking App. It'll be the same experience as Whataburger, but you know, you're probably trusted even more, if it's in your mobile banking app, than the Whataburger

S Speaker 230:30So how many things like we've got about 100,000 users, so small scale at the moment, but that's 100,000 more than anybody else in America has for biometric payments. That's not true. Amazon's got probably, you guys probably know better than us, but they, I'm guessing, they've got over a million users. Gotcha. Okay, so 100,000

S Speaker 231:01Yeah, it's through the various apps, but it's all those 100,000 are all in the JP Morgan identity service. So for the next like year, probably 18 months, everything will be JP Morgan pushing it. It'll take us another 12 months to get PayPal, you know, turned on, or Capital One turned on, but, but, so, yeah, it's all that 100,000 database is really JP Morgan's under. You know, we built it before they got involved, but it's being transferred them as part of the
