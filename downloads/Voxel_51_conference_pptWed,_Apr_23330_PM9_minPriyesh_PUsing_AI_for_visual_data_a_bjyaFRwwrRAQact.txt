We partner, we I'll get, I'll talk about our our, our community in a minute. But we are, because we started an open source we're extremely flexible. We integrate, so we are like the home base for all of these different tools and parts of the ML workflow. So whether it's annotation, training, which is certain pytorch evaluation, the models themselves. We're not a model Company, but you can bring your own VLM, your vision language model or or get one within our model zoo, if you So, if you So, choose infrastructure. For example, before box 51 there has not really been a place to there's not been a home base for for working with all these tools in the context of your data, which is again, the most important part when you're talking about model,

S Speaker 16:23We are. Our tool is agnostic. We weren't we just because we had early automotive customers, we built the tool kit to be agnostic. So we have use cases in manufacturing, defect detection, in defense, in retail, think about Walmart developing a smoke detection model or a theft detection model, med tech, agriculture technology, we've got customers like John Deere building autonomous machinery and autonomous planting models. So a tractor is out of the field, has to understand what's a weed, where to pull that, what's a seed, where to plant it. This is all physical AI stuff. We're hearing a lot about from you know, thought leaders in the space that realized that that this visual data is a really important unlock for these physical applications that we, you know, see, we see and feel on a daily basis. Maybe I should have said this beginning, we're a small company, but we've got big customers. I mean, this is a snapshot of our of our customer list, from the fortune 2000s to the federal government to the automakers and insurance carriers in the world that are relying on us. Their ml teams are relying on us to to provide them a toolkit where they can actually work with the data they're collecting, what synthetic data they're generating so they can get these models into production, so they can satisfy their VP or director of AI, who's having to answer the CEO says, AI is super important, and we're and we are doing everything in our power to get AI models into our products and into the world faster. We're also trusted by state of the art, so Microsoft meta, we have been paramount in the development of actual open source
