S Speaker 20:34yeah. And that's what I'm saying. I think Linux goes up into the other bucket. Yeah. I mean, they are definitely in the premium tier. They started with the insurers. Yes, the their growth came from ELD and all that stuff, but it was largely around their vision based hardware, right? They're a hardware guy. They sell hardware and and software. So they're like the older generation. They're the first wave of companies and new video telematics that are the Pioneer, right? Yeah, yeah, and you have metrodyne and auto are the challengers.

S Speaker 11:12And I guess, not sure if this is a point worthwhile to make, but it's way more difficult to sort of move upstream in this market than move downstream because all of all the training data hindrance that comes with training ml models, making it accurate and things like that. Yeah,

S Speaker 21:35I'm Jury's out on that one for now, right? Yeah, I'm not 100% convinced either. Samsara also right from where they started in the ecosystem, and again, they have a different the play for them is operational efficiency, right? Yeah. So they're starting from tracking everything your fleet does to make your operations perform better, whether your operations within the truck or outside of the truck. That's kind of their sweet spot. They've moved up into video. And if you look at the past 18 months, video has been a big growth driver for them. So they're clearly moving up stack, right? And as the 800 pound gorilla, probably in the space that's the, the kind of question mark in my mind is like, hey, you know, these guys grew like, $200 million Arr, last year. And we really say they're not doing it. I don't think, I don't think that's, you know, I think that's being a little too disingenuous. Yes, I think they can. The difference there is, they're also very walled garden, closed source, right? They want people using samsara products, so they have a large hardware element as well. But they are clearly moving up the stack we'll all end up competing for, like we're all slicing the markets differently today, yeah, but we'll all end up competing for stuff eventually.

S Speaker 23:10so yes and no, right? But I think that. I think jury's still out, but if you look at the guy who's performing best, they're showing that they can do that, and then in the truth is M and A in the space actually correlates to that as well. Like these big guys are acquiring both video and ELD, and, you know, other solutions within the space to beef up their capability. So they're clearly trying to move, they're moving downstream, for sure, right? Like a lot of these ELD players are being doubled up, and they push that in the market, but they're also coming upstream as well.
so yes and no, right? But I think that. I think jury's still out, but if you look at the guy who's performing best, they're showing that they can do that, and then in the truth is M and A in the space actually correlates to that as well.

S Speaker 13:45Yeah, yeah, agreed. And the next slide I put up bridge was on market positioning. I've just used this from their deck itself. And the point I wanted to convey using this was that broadly, we've been speaking that there are, there is an upstream market, there's a mid market, there's a small fleets market, and natody in positions itself, in a way that they have a solution from for the premium market, but they have different tiers of their product which would serve the lower market as well. And hence they are very well suited to compete in each of these markets right now. So I've broken down their pricing plans into features, and this is how it looks. What do you think about it? Do you think it's redundant?
Yeah, yeah, agreed. And the next slide I put up bridge was on market positioning. I've just used this from their deck itself.

S Speaker 24:34It's okay if it's redundant, as long as there's, like, you know, clear message in there, this, this. Could you know whether it, whether we have it in, you know, the main slide or the backup is always good to understand this, I had a challenge too, with, like, all the right? There's like, a bunch of different ways to skin the market, right? You can look at it by markets. You could look at it by pricing. You could look at it by the, you know, the types of market that they serve as well.

5:04So that's the part that I had a tough time
So that's the part that I had a tough time

So that's the part that I had a tough time
5:42to water lead it.
S Speaker 25:43So what like where nitro dine shines is premium tier for the transportation segment of the market, right? Where Netra dine shines is, I guess you know, both premium and mid tier for the fleet, for the services side of the fleet, not that they don't do transportation, because they do, but where they have the most value add is operational versus transportation, right? It's what's within the truck and what's outside of the truck. And I think that that's a way to kind of think about it as well. So like NATO, Nitro, Dyne, it's all the stuff and operations that happen within a vehicle, but they're moving moving outward, right to workflows and other stuff, just where they're starting, while motive and samsara are trying to give a complete picture for operational efficiency of the of the whole, you know, the kind of a system level, all in one solution, yeah. And so it's just different approaches at segmenting the market, but that's all that they're doing today, right? It's, it's a big market. They're not all connected vehicles. And like, how do you connect those vehicles to continue to grow the market? And, you know, cameras are a part of that market, but it's a quickly growing part of that market, so there's going to be a lot of competition for that segment of the market. And it only makes sense, because the market's growing, right,

7:32right? Yeah, agreed. And
right? Yeah, agreed. And
right? Yeah, agreed. And
right? Yeah, agreed. And
S Speaker 27:35the connectivity piece is definitely a lot more mature, right? The connected vehicle piece, the ELD, the workflows, all that stuff, the telematics, right? Omni tracks. It's been in business forever. Yeah, that stuff is a, I don't want to call it a commodity market, but the only reason it grew over the past couple of years is regulation, not

8:07right? Agreed? Yes.
S Speaker 28:10If you look at like the ELD players, like, if you need ELD solutions, there might be 500 different solutions you can go for, right? Like, it's a commodity. If you go onto like, geotech or any of these platform guys, you'll see 100 solutions we can pick from practice, like pages and pages and pages like, pick your pick your flavor, right? Like, right? It

8:33doesn't matter. Yes,
8:38yeah, no, this is super awesome.
yeah, no, this is super awesome.
yeah, no, this is super awesome.
yeah, no, this is super awesome.
8:41I need to spend some time with it, but I think that that
I need to spend some time with it, but I think that that
I need to spend some time with it, but I think that that
I need to spend some time with it, but I think that that
S Speaker 28:48just couldn't figure out a nice way to delay that. I think you did a great job.
just couldn't figure out a nice way to delay that. I think you did a great job.
just couldn't figure out a nice way to delay that. I think you did a great job.
just couldn't figure out a nice way to delay that. I think you did a great job.
S Speaker 18:53Yeah, I was struggling with that rich for sure. I tried a couple of ways to put it together. I tried boxes, I tried clocks and everything,
Yeah, I was struggling with that rich for sure. I tried a couple of ways to put it together. I tried boxes, I tried clocks and everything,
Yeah, I was struggling with that rich for sure. I tried a couple of ways to put it together. I tried boxes, I tried clocks and everything,
Yeah, I was struggling with that rich for sure. I tried a couple of ways to put it together. I tried boxes, I tried clocks and everything,
S Speaker 29:03yeah. I tried to put it all on a, you know, like a timeline between connected vehicle and video, right? Yeah, right, yeah, up and down arrows for, you know, just to do your typical four quadrants. And I'm like, but there's more quadrants. How the hell do I break out? Like, you know, you need, like, a box matrix,
yeah. I tried to put it all on a, you know, like a timeline between connected vehicle and video, right? Yeah, right, yeah, up and down arrows for, you know, just to do your typical four quadrants. And I'm like, but there's more quadrants. How the hell do I break out? Like, you know, you need, like, a box matrix,

And I'm like, but there's more quadrants. How the hell do I break out? Like, you know, you need, like, a box matrix,
S Speaker 19:23exactly. I think something like this with your voiceover would do the trick.
exactly. I think something like this with your voiceover would do the trick.
exactly. I think something like this with your voiceover would do the trick.
exactly. I think something like this with your voiceover would do the trick.
S Speaker 29:27Yeah, and you're, you're welcome to present on this piece too. I mean, you put it together if you're interested in it, if you don't want to, it's, it's fine as well.
Yeah, and you're, you're welcome to present on this piece too. I mean, you put it together if you're interested in it, if you don't want to, it's, it's fine as well.
Yeah, and you're, you're welcome to present on this piece too. I mean, you put it together if you're interested in it, if you don't want to, it's, it's fine as well.
Yeah, and you're, you're welcome to present on this piece too. I mean, you put it together if you're interested in it, if you don't want to, it's, it's fine as well.
S Speaker 19:36I wouldn't mind if you feel, if you feel, it wouldn't break the flow. I wouldn't mind, but I'm happy. Either way. I don't mind either. Well,
I wouldn't mind if you feel, if you feel, it wouldn't break the flow. I wouldn't mind, but I'm happy. Either way. I don't mind either. Well,
I wouldn't mind if you feel, if you feel, it wouldn't break the flow. I wouldn't mind, but I'm happy. Either way. I don't mind either. Well,
I wouldn't mind if you feel, if you feel, it wouldn't break the flow. I wouldn't mind, but I'm happy. Either way. I don't mind either. Well,
S Speaker 29:44but prepare for it. I'll likely say, Priyesh, put these slides together that you did a great job. Let them walk you through, and then I'll, you know, jump in with any other stuff to add. I mean, I think a lot of it will be covered as we build up to here as well. We get a lot of these themes, regardless. Yeah, but yeah, and you can, you can go through it, you did the work. So, you know, you should show that you did the work.
but prepare for it. I'll likely say, Priyesh, put these slides together that you did a great job. Let them walk you through, and then I'll, you know, jump in with any other stuff to add.

S Speaker 110:09Okay, sounds good? Rich. Couple of very small suggestions I had. Do you think it's worthwhile for us to have something like this or this slide, at least in the backup.

S Speaker 210:44and I didn't break that one out, mainly since, since it's so nascent. And if you look at my financials as well, I'm basically saying kind of discount that story a little bit. I think it's going to be a longer road. Yeah, if you look at Fleet Management, the bottom side, right? They have a much more aggressive ramp, 80 million by 27 I'm like, relax. I think that's a really tough, difficult market. It'll take longer to go out and compete with samsara, who's the monster in that Geotab, who you know, owns, you know, as basically 5x more, you know, vehicles and integrations that that either of those. So, yeah, it'll be a, it'll be a tougher road to to win in that segment, not that they can. It's just going to be a longer road fleet management is actually, it's an interesting play. But it's also interesting on the margin side, right? Because they have all the hardware in the vehicle. So adding fleet management is like, super high gross margin. It's just, you know, additional arbou for very incremental cost. Yeah.

S Speaker 111:58agreed and on this slide exit analysis, which I couldn't find the multiple we have used, I think specifically you missed adding that somewhere. Well,

S Speaker 212:12it's the blue 14 up top, right on there that correlates with the yellow box. It's always that one, yeah,

12:23fair enough got it, and we can,
fair enough got it, and we can,
fair enough got it, and we can,
fair enough got it, and we can,
S Speaker 212:25we can decide if that's the right or wrong multiple it felt right. I don't know, right. I mean, these things go all over the place, I'm sorry. Is like crazy, yeah, the the, if you end up in telematics, you're like, in the six and 7x kind of sucks. So 1214, we have to believe that they hit their vision right, that they get the multiple that they're looking for because they fulfill the vision. I don't think you say these guys are going to be a failure, so you give them the low multiple if you think they're going to be a failure, just don't do the deal. Yeah,
we can decide if that's the right or wrong multiple it felt right. I don't know, right. I mean, these things go all over the place, I'm sorry.

S Speaker 113:06fair enough, and we're not going for any secondary. Is it rich? I don't know. Okay, that's
fair enough, and we're not going for any secondary. Is it rich? I don't know. Okay, that's
fair enough, and we're not going for any secondary. Is it rich? I don't know. Okay, that's
fair enough, and we're not going for any secondary. Is it rich? I don't know. Okay, that's
S Speaker 213:14a quick decision. Obviously, it doesn't change the economics too much. I mean, you get like, a 30% discount on whatever part you plan on putting in. So blended, you know, 15% discount. Who cares? It doesn't change your returns. I don't get stuck in in the semantics. It's either you think you can make four or 5x or you don't think you can make four or 5x

S Speaker 113:38Fair enough. Yeah, that makes sense. Got it rich, so I think that was all on my end. If there's anything else that you want me to work on, I'm happy to do over the next two days,

S Speaker 139:07with Chef, sure, Varsha. So one quick thing there, Varsha, so there has been a slight changes in my role. I think probably some of the discussions you may have had with Tushar and Carlos resulted into this. So the team now wants me to focus more on deals which will go on stage one. So for so that's that's good. I feel it'll be good to be more part of deals I'm working on nata time right now, which we plan to put on stage one this week. And then on that aspect, Tushar asked me not to work on these deals quite a lot, until we decide to move forward on them. But I've, separately, still spend time here, but I haven't let him know. So would be good if you don't let him know either.

S Speaker 140:23spend some time on both of these deals. So I sure have given more time to pop ID right now, just because I've had a couple of calls with John, and then I have a set of I've done the first level of going through the model for chef. I have a set of questions to send to him, and then we'll go, okay, I can take that over there. So, yeah, no, I don't mind being involved. I just like, I have, yeah, so why don't we see where we
spend some time on both of these deals. So I sure have given more time to pop ID right now, just because I've had a couple of calls with John, and then I have a set of I've done the first level of going through the model for chef.

S Speaker 141:07We discussed a few points Varsha, which I've validated with them. Okay, so I'll also put that up, or I'll just read it through for you. So I've discussed the churn. Let me just go through it like one by one. I have an understanding of the revenue structure, the financing specifically discuss the churn, so I have notes on that. I have gone through that pipeline, so I understand they have decent amount of pipeline for the next couple of years. Competition. I haven't taken a look yet, and then I have a set of questions that I want to send it to him. Uh, broadly these so he, the way He projects his top line, there is a significant amount of expansion Arr, in 2026

I haven't taken a look yet, and then I have a set of questions that I want to send it to him. Uh, broadly these so he, the way He projects his top line, there is a significant amount of expansion Arr, in 2026
42:03which I wanted to understand better,
which I wanted to understand better,
which I wanted to understand better,
which I wanted to understand better,
S Speaker 142:06but his net revenue retention has been really good, so I don't doubt that. Don't doubt the expansion. But then there has been some this is significant here, plus in the deck, one a couple of other questions that were coming out one second, I'll put The deck out.

S Speaker 142:31So in the deck as well. I
So in the deck as well. I
So in the deck as well. I
So in the deck as well. I
S Speaker 342:55one of the customers. So he updated, I think one of them is lost, and hence they don't add up. So it will be less than is it still 59 or it's not 59
one of the customers. So he updated, I think one of them is lost, and hence they don't add up. So it will be less than is it still 59 or it's not 59

one of the customers. So he updated, I think one of them is lost, and hence they don't add up. So it will be less than is it still 59 or it's not 59
S Speaker 143:09it's expansion error potential to be 59
it's expansion error potential to be 59
it's expansion error potential to be 59
it's expansion error potential to be 59
43:13Yes. So what is not adding up? So
Yes. So what is not adding up? So
Yes. So what is not adding up? So
Yes. So what is not adding up? So
S Speaker 143:16one that, hello, fresh has churned. So expansion potential for them. I don't know if they would be expanding anymore. His point on Hello Fresh churn was that the business is not doing well. They are restricting a lot of their auxiliary functions, which makes sense. But then again, most of this expansion error is in Taylor farms, so wanted to understand that better as well on how the Taylor farm contract is going, specially given that this specific contract is just one year, versus all of their other contracts are typically three years. Yeah. So that's one area I think we discussed this. I am supposed to do this still, wherein I they are amortizing the robot for 70 to 72 months, not years. We plan to do it for three years, given that many of the contracts, is three. So I will do it on my end, but I wanted to get his understanding on why is he doing that? And specifically, if, hello, fresh is churning what? What are the plans to do with that robot there. So this is like the one part that I will do and give it to you. Plus, I am supposed to get his pipeline in a downloadable fashion. Right now, it's just on a view only upload as on the top send. So once I do that, I will validate the top line as well and give it to you. So I'll give my understanding on how that outline should be working and how the cost in terms of amortization, should go other than that, the software cost and thing service cost, all of them seemed very well put together. So I don't think we would have a lot of stuff to do there, and it's a very well put together model. I was really amazed the way he has put everything together. Yeah. So I can put together the set of questions, send it to you before sending it to him today, maybe in a couple of hours, and then I can send it to him. Okay,

S Speaker 345:16so the so you, I think the main question I had on this was whether it can clear the hurdle of 30 million, 30 million proceeds. I don't think you have gotten there yet,
so the so you, I think the main question I had on this was whether it can clear the hurdle of 30 million, 30 million proceeds. I don't think you have gotten there yet,

so the so you, I think the main question I had on this was whether it can clear the hurdle of 30 million, 30 million proceeds. I don't think you have gotten there yet,
S Speaker 145:26right? No, I the top line. Like, once I go through the top line and the pipeline, I think I'll get there, probably in a couple of days. Okay, at the outset, version, they seem to have strong pipeline. There is 14 point 6 million in weighted average pipeline, and this pipeline has 27 million of expansion potential. So the first, like very broad top level, I would say it seems worth spending more time here. Yeah,
right? No, I the top line. Like, once I go through the top line and the pipeline, I think I'll get there, probably in a couple of days. Okay, at the outset, version, they seem to have strong pipeline. There is 14 point 6 million in weighted average pipeline, and this pipeline has 27 million of expansion potential.

So the first, like very broad top level, I would say it seems worth spending more time here. Yeah,
S Speaker 345:57so I will do you have the pipeline from them, can you just send it to me? Yes,
so I will do you have the pipeline from them, can you just send it to me? Yes,
so I will do you have the pipeline from them, can you just send it to me? Yes,
so I will do you have the pipeline from them, can you just send it to me? Yes,
46:04it should be on the
46:15it. Yes, this, this. This link has it virtual

46:22just forward with the link,
just forward with the link,

46:25or even who is paste it. Okay,
or even who is paste it. Okay,
or even who is paste it. Okay,
or even who is paste it. Okay,
S Speaker 146:32but the pipeline isn't downloadable, so I have, we'll have to ask him that. Okay,
but the pipeline isn't downloadable, so I have, we'll have to ask him that. Okay,
but the pipeline isn't downloadable, so I have, we'll have to ask him that. Okay,
but the pipeline isn't downloadable, so I have, we'll have to ask him that. Okay,
S Speaker 146:43So I'll get couple of these things done sooner than later.
So I'll get couple of these things done sooner than later.
So I'll get couple of these things done sooner than later.
So I'll get couple of these things done sooner than later.
S Speaker 347:01you're happy with this change of role, then Priyesh, I think
you're happy with this change of role, then Priyesh, I think
you're happy with this change of role, then Priyesh, I think
you're happy with this change of role, then Priyesh, I think
S Speaker 147:04it's it's better than before. It still doesn't give me the full visibility on the deal process, but it gives me more ownership, I guess, and I'll be working with more investment partners, so that will be good. Yeah. Okay, sounds good. So, yeah, I'm glad this changed. And I think like now, the role focus from 70 80% of the time spending on sourcing has been reduced to 30 to 40. So I don't mind. Okay, yeah, on pop ID Bucha. So I've had a chat, I've intro, had an intro chat with John, and then I sat with their CFO to go through the model. So a couple of questions I had for you as well. How comfortable are we with the JPMC projections? The JPMC projections that they have given to pop ID, the team, says that these are agreements. They don't have the numbers set in the contracts, but they have some very minimal downside protection. So do you suggest we still go ahead and discount the projections that JPMC have given them?
it's it's better than before. It still doesn't give me the full visibility on the deal process, but it gives me more ownership, I guess, and I'll be working with more investment partners, so that will be good. Yeah. Okay, sounds good. So, yeah, I'm glad this changed. And I think like now, the role focus from 70 80% of the time spending on sourcing has been reduced to 30 to 40. So I don't mind.

S Speaker 348:11So JPMC gave these numbers or I didn't follow so the
So JPMC gave these numbers or I didn't follow so the
So JPMC gave these numbers or I didn't follow so the
So JPMC gave these numbers or I didn't follow so the
S Speaker 148:16top line number here of total biometric checkouts is has been given by JPMC. Okay, I have discounted that by 15% I'm not being too aggressive, because they mentioned that they have had multiple discussions with JPMC before coming to this number. And JPMC has gone into detail, tried to understand which industries would adopt when they would adopt it. So they JPMC has an understanding of these numbers, but it's, it's not contractually defined,
top line number here of total biometric checkouts is has been given by JPMC. Okay, I have discounted that by 15% I'm not being too aggressive, because they mentioned that they have had multiple discussions with JPMC before coming to this number. And JPMC has gone into detail, tried to understand which industries would adopt when they would adopt it. So they JPMC has an understanding of these numbers, but it's, it's not contractually defined,

Okay, I have discounted that by 15% I'm not being too aggressive, because they mentioned that they have had multiple discussions with JPMC before coming to this number. And JPMC has gone into detail, tried to understand which industries would adopt when they would adopt it. So they JPMC has an understanding of these numbers, but it's, it's not contractually defined,
S Speaker 348:49okay, so none of this is defined in the agreement.
okay, so none of this is defined in the agreement.
okay, so none of this is defined in the agreement.
okay, so none of this is defined in the agreement.
S Speaker 148:53Yeah, okay, got it, okay, so I have this. Yes, okay. And so according
Yeah, okay, got it, okay, so I have this. Yes, okay. And so according
Yeah, okay, got it, okay, so I have this. Yes, okay. And so according
Yeah, okay, got it, okay, so I have this. Yes, okay. And so according
S Speaker 348:59to this, then they make money like, Just go. Just walk me through what you understood?
to this, then they make money like, Just go. Just walk me through what you understood?
to this, then they make money like, Just go. Just walk me through what you understood?
to this, then they make money like, Just go. Just walk me through what you understood?
S Speaker 149:05Yeah, sure. So this, these are the top line numbers that JPMC has given them on total number of biometric checkouts. They say that there will be two check ins per checkout. So check in is every time you go in and check for your loyalty or you check in on the app, these numbers were 50% so pop ID estimates that they would the total number of JPMC checkouts. They would do 50% through their direct sales. They had 50% throughout. I've ramped up from 25 to 50, I've asked for that pipeline, not a very well put together pipeline, but still some numbers in there, and some discussions that they're having. So thesis here is that once they become more prominent, and JPMC adopts them, there will be more direct sales as well. Okay, network effects, maybe then, based on this, the total amount of non JPMC check in checkouts. These are numbers, again, given to them by JPMC. So this is the average biometric payment size. They say they start with restaurants and then move into retail events. And hence the average transaction size will increase. So this is total gross payment value. They then put all of these number the consumer preference on whether they will use consumers would use card or ACH to pay has been given by JPMC, and they mentioned that down the line ACH will gain interaction. Card would go down. So that is how this is put together. Then they break that down in terms of total JPMC card transactions, JPMC ACH transactions, non JPMC card, non JPMC Ach, and they make more on Ach, yes, yes. Okay. And this has been, this is contractually defined. So the pricing and the tier, the total amount of transactions and the pricing that they will get from JPMC on the current transaction, yeah, and similarly, for the check in, there is a cost on check in. So all of this together boils down into the revenue section here. So this is the total check in, check out revenue from JPMC and non JPMC contracts,
Yeah, sure. So this, these are the top line numbers that JPMC has given them on total number of biometric checkouts. They say that there will be two check ins per checkout. So check in is every time you go in and check for your loyalty or you check in on the app, these numbers were 50% so pop ID estimates that they would the total number of JPMC checkouts.

Yeah, sure. So this, these are the top line numbers that JPMC has given them on total number of biometric checkouts. They say that there will be two check ins per checkout.

S Speaker 351:30yeah. And what is non JPMC contract? Non
yeah. And what is non JPMC contract? Non
yeah. And what is non JPMC contract? Non
yeah. And what is non JPMC contract? Non
S Speaker 151:34JPMC is the direct selling contracts, the water burger kind of thing.
JPMC is the direct selling contracts, the water burger kind of thing.
JPMC is the direct selling contracts, the water burger kind of thing.
JPMC is the direct selling contracts, the water burger kind of thing.
51:39And what is bigger right now,
And what is bigger right now,
And what is bigger right now,
And what is bigger right now,
S Speaker 151:41JPMC is bigger Russia. So if you see JPMC check in and card here, they're 46 roughly, and this is 22.5
JPMC is bigger Russia. So if you see JPMC check in and card here, they're 46 roughly, and this is 22.5
JPMC is bigger Russia. So if you see JPMC check in and card here, they're 46 roughly, and this is 22.5
JPMC is bigger Russia. So if you see JPMC check in and card here, they're 46 roughly, and this is 22.5
S Speaker 351:52Okay, so as you grow up as well, it's, it's bigger, yeah,
Okay, so as you grow up as well, it's, it's bigger, yeah,
Okay, so as you grow up as well, it's, it's bigger, yeah,
Okay, so as you grow up as well, it's, it's bigger, yeah,
S Speaker 151:57and right. And this, number itself defines that Bucha, because this is more top down. It's 25% of that, it's 30% of JPMC. So
and right. And this, number itself defines that Bucha, because this is more top down. It's 25% of that, it's 30% of JPMC. So
and right. And this, number itself defines that Bucha, because this is more top down. It's 25% of that, it's 30% of JPMC. So
and right. And this, number itself defines that Bucha, because this is more top down. It's 25% of that, it's 30% of JPMC. So
S Speaker 352:07okay, so this means even in the outer year, it's 50% JPMC, yeah,
okay, so this means even in the outer year, it's 50% JPMC, yeah,
okay, so this means even in the outer year, it's 50% JPMC, yeah,
okay, so this means even in the outer year, it's 50% JPMC, yeah,
52:12that's what they have estimated. Okay,
that's what they have estimated. Okay,
that's what they have estimated. Okay,
that's what they have estimated. Okay,
S Speaker 152:16I will, I will take a look at the pipeline more in detail and see if there could be more, finer tweaks done on these numbers. That's fine. Okay. Licensing number, I haven't discounted them. They say that they are in talks with Middle East government, so there'll be some Yeah, yeah. And then pay back is where they provide the end to end payment infrastructure. Yes, it's also very small. So this boils down into the total pop ID revenues. Okay, so so far, on the top line, the only discounting has been done is 15% discounting on JPMC revenue and non JPMC has been ramped up from 50 to 25 to 50. So I've changed that so that gets you to the total revenues on the costs front this

S Speaker 153:17on the costs front this, this entire segment is in terms of total number of they have just estimated how many users would be there, comparing it with the total transactions that are happening on the platform. They mentioned that they have used, they had used a 10% churn. I started it with 15, and I have gone I've reduced it to 10 as network effects kick in, okay? And they have sent their usage from Whataburger, which was near, I would say, a student or a university. And hence the usage pattern there didn't give me a lot of insights into the churn pattern here, because that's very seasonal. And then they say that a lot of students churn out because they graduate and stuff cost here, broadly Varsha there, there's a cost on ACH processing. And they say that down the line, the cost would go down as this technology gets commoditized. Then there is cost on Cloud processing, biometric software, licensing, liveness. What's interesting is, what

54:37So the gross margins were
So the gross margins were
So the gross margins were
So the gross margins were
S Speaker 154:42okay. It starts from 10. Yeah, the gross margins are low today, for sure, because all of these costs are fixed costs and as per their contracts, so as the scale that will go down, sorry, okay, yeah, so the biometric licensing costs are also it's not much, right? It's not much today, 200k yeah, okay, and working capital requirement, because there is some delay between when the payments come in, and then they have to pay the money. So it's, again, not significant, I'd say. And revenue sharing is not significant to get it, but it becomes substantial. It becomes about half of the entire cost by 2029 and then I haven't gone into the employees and facility costs. So when I put this together back here as a summary slide, they they project raising 15 right now they, as per their as per their projections, there wasn't a need for another raise. But after discounting a top line, I think they would need to at least raise 10 million in 2027 the gross margins are from 10 to 64 there is a roughly 50% year on year growth here, and I put that all together in the returns analysis. Second So, returns, analysis, some comps, I've used our public comps, some m&a comps. Median was coming at around 6.9 here, so I've used a 6.5x here. The
okay. It starts from 10. Yeah, the gross margins are low today, for sure, because all of these costs are fixed costs and as per their contracts, so as the scale that will go down, sorry, okay, yeah, so the biometric licensing costs are also it's not much, right?

S Speaker 156:59Aiden was, yeah, I checked they had a very strong year on year growth. Okay? It's also a payment platform, okay? And there were some m&a comps here as well, which I didn't use. Actually, we can, we can go back on the multiple year. But I've used a 6.5 I've said 45 million exit revenue, yeah, and I, I've assumed dilution for the next funding, and we haven't participated in that. So based on all of that, it comes to 4.8x as the base case. Okay,
Aiden was, yeah, I checked they had a very strong year on year growth. Okay? It's also a payment platform, okay? And there were some m&a comps here as well, which I didn't use.

S Speaker 357:36and the assume a follow on participation, and what is the ownership at exit? Have you put in 20% dilution? Or how much is that?
and the assume a follow on participation, and what is the ownership at exit? Have you put in 20% dilution? Or how much is that?

No, I haven't put in an exit dilution. Should I? Yeah,
No, I haven't put in an exit dilution. Should I? Yeah,
S Speaker 357:54normally, what we say is that exit, you know, let's just assume, if it is an IPO, that this is a 300 million exit, right? Yeah, or 500 million. Okay, so then it may not be so current ownership is 5% 4.9% Yeah. Is that current? Okay, so then we should just dilute it to Yeah. I will do that. Normally. We dilute it by 20% for exit for an IPO and Okay, so this may be a 5x to 7x deal or lower. Okay, understood. Okay, this is good. You don't have to spend any more time Priyesh on this till I get it clarified. This may end up becoming a BU deal, okay? And not a venture deal. So we'll go through and now he sent a new set of projections going to like 200 million or so to
normally, what we say is that exit, you know, let's just assume, if it is an IPO, that this is a 300 million exit, right? Yeah, or 500 million.

S Speaker 158:46500 million. I haven't gone through that yet, so the discussion was that he said he will go more aggressive on how the licensing cost would shape up in Middle East and how they can expand, and stuff like that. And then he has made a very strong model. I'll have to, I'll have to check that as well. Okay, yeah,
500 million.
