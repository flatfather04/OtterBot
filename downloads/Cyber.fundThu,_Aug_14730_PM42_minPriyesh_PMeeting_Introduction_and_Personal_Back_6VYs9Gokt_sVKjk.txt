S Speaker 117:30uh, MBA was particularly because I wanted to transition into venture and venture, because during my undergrad, I had worked with so many different startups across different sectors, from FinTech to social media to Ed Tech, and I realized early stage is something that is really my calling. I quite enjoy the unstructured space, but I don't want to also sort of constrain myself to one particular idea and build just towards that. So I wanted to be breath first and also work with different entrepreneurial setups. And I when I decided I'll make that pivot, Silicon Valley, seemed like the best part to do it. So that's why, that's why I chose this entire transition

I just want to ask what one general question was in your most successful deal, that maybe you let yourself, yeah, like that would be great if you, if you source them, let them. How did you find them? What was the conviction? Why did you do it? What round was it? Yeah, understand, what's your what's the one deal that you're proud of yourself, that you did?
there. This from your portfolio, like you've been, I don't know how heavy people caught on. I just want to ask what one general question was in your most successful deal, that maybe you let yourself, yeah, like that would be great if you, if you source them, let them. How did you find them? What was the conviction? Why did you do it? What round was it? Yeah, understand, what's your what's the one deal that you're proud of yourself, that you did?

S Speaker 120:33So I would say the most, the deal that I'm most proud of hasn't closed yet, but I will take you through one deal that that has closed. I had met this company is called context AI. This is an AI native office suite, so think of Microsoft Office, but entirely AI native on Cloud. I had met this founder at a Stanford Demo Day sometime early last year, probably in September, roughly around that time. So I met this, found a very interesting guy. He actually was a Stanford CS, then dropped out, got Thiel fellowship and wanted to start something whenever, when I was just talking to him, realized that he has been building different smaller sort of startups and smaller projects from age 11, and he was quite a very genius kind of a guy. He would always scale different consumer focused companies to a next extent, but had a very big vision of creating something very generational, which was very exciting to me. So I connected him to some of my members in the Qualcomm ventures team. My Managing Partner also quite liked him, so we engaged him with some of Qualcomm's business unit contracts and things like that. And then we led his seed round in March this year, which was a $10 million round co participated by Lux capital and general Catalyst. We were able to give get some allocation here, because it was very hotly contested. We were able to get allocation because we were working with the founder for some time. So we, we did a $1.5 million check in this round. And what it's a seed seed drawing, yes. So they, they raised a big seed round. The founder really believed that. I think the general thesis here, Eric is that a AI native suite for Microsoft would be something that foundation model companies will build themselves. In fact, even today, you will see GPT going forward with generating some Excel spreadsheet on the chat box itself, generating some PPDs. They're not very visually appealing today, but they will get there. But there is a time window where, say, let's the next one year or next two years. There's a time window before GPT five actually catches on. During this time window, if someone can build fast, have a very high product velocity, can actually acquire customers and build workflows on top of that and create a workflow which is very sticky that could win. So these guys were actually, I get it, yeah, one
So I would say the most, the deal that I'm most proud of hasn't closed yet, but I will take you through one deal that that has closed. I had met this company is called context AI.

Yeah, and you have to basically your thesis here is chatgpt will catch up, no doubt, yeah, but you want this company to leverage velocity and be the market mover, yes? Actually, yes.

They hired the GTM manager from haygen, which itself had gone very viral sometime back, so they understood this entire space, and it felt like a very good bet to take at that point of time when we were investing. They were also not any specific horizontal office suite. They were point solutions for PPD generation, like genspark or Gama. They were point solution for Excel analysis. They were point solution for doc creation, but there wasn't one platform which would connect all of these workflows together. And I personally felt that as many of us doing knowledge work, we shift from one app to the other. We do some data analysis on Excel. We take that chart, we put it on presentation, we research the web. We take some of that analysis create a presentation, so them, sort of creating a platform which connects all of these tools together. Was also from a product perspective, it made a lot of sense.

26:10given that you said to me,

given that you said to me,
S Speaker 226:15then I just have maybe one questions to ask you, right? What do you look for in founders at such such early stage, like both green flag and red flags? What do you look for? Because there's no data room,

S Speaker 126:30totally, totally, I think, uh, Eric team is a very big part of what I look at. And I think I am getting better at this, the more I do this job, over and over again. I think quite sort of focus on the team background, and if they have a very unique insight about what they're trying to build, and I think the insight can come both from either them, having spent a lot of time in this market, and being at some of the some of the companies that are very deep in this market, and getting insights from there, or just that, this specific founder thinks about this in a very different way. And I try to look for some of those insights, and then I try to look if this is the founding team which can actually build something like this, and then essentially, what is their vision with the entire program there could be at that point. I can sort of evaluate the market, evaluate the product, but I also understand that they can go through multiple pivots from that point. So really trying to understand the end vision, how these guys work. What is their work ethic? Is this a sort of founder market fit, founder Product Market Fit profile. Does this work or not? And then a lot of times when I'm investing in. pre seed, not pre seed, haven't turned up pre seed round, but seed. I also go in with my own thesis. So I have broader thesis around voice solutions, video solutions, knowledge work and any space I do, I like to create theses of my own. So I try to see if it really matches my thinking. If not, do they actually have valid, rational points to beat my thesis and try to also evaluate from that perspective?

S Speaker 128:22So something that I've realized about the venture job. Eric, and I don't know maybe you would relate to this, but I think venture job is slightly difficult because you have to be in a position where you say that, hey, I will not invest in this founder, even though that founder is much more knowledgeable about that sector than I am, and has spent multiple in years in that area. So I respect the fact that the founder is coming from deep background and has a lot more knowledge about that space. But something I really don't like is if the founder does not have humility, I feel that the founder being very humidity humility, he's not humble. Yeah, if found is not humble, that's that's a very strong red flag, in my opinion. I feel in that case, the founder would not be able to pivot quite a lot. The founder would not be able to take feedback from both customers, internal team. The founder would not be able to create a culture in the team. So I feel that's a big red flag that I had I really don't like. But other than that, a lot of yellow flags as well. Something would be if the founder has never built anything or has no insights about the industry is going on, if I try to see if there is an ability for the founder to hire people even more experienced or even more stellar than him. So try to sort of assess some of those factors as well.

S Speaker 229:50Makes total sense as well. Apart from Sanford School, right? You mentioned what? Okay, I know the professor there, just wondering, right, what? How do you usually source deal? Don't get me wrong, SF is crazy. Everywhere back, right? I went to SF about a month and a half ago. I was there that was my first time in the States, and this time in New York is my second time in the States, right? It's going to be more and more, and more, but I'm just saying that back then, I felt like my entire phone was on the street in the Bay Area, like I see all the apps that I use on a daily basis. Everything just excites me. I never seen such a place ever in my life. Yeah, right. No, no. The fact that I live in London, Dubai, Singapore, whatever, it's not the same. But I'm just saying that there's just so many places where I'm also very close with Asia house and all these different people. Yeah, I'm just wondering where do you source your deal to get into pre seed and seed, that's hard, yes, it's hard to get those deals enhanced.

But I'm just saying that there's just so many places where I'm also very close with Asia house and all these different people. Yeah, I'm just wondering where do you source your deal to get into pre seed and seed, that's hard, yes, it's hard to get those deals enhanced.
Makes total sense as well. Apart from Sanford School, right? You mentioned what? Okay, I know the professor there, just wondering, right, what? How do you usually source deal? Don't get me wrong, SF is crazy. Everywhere back, right? I went to SF about a month and a half ago. I was there that was my first time in the States, and this time in New York is my second time in the States, right? It's going to be more and more, and more, but I'm just saying that back then, I felt like my entire phone was on the street in the Bay Area, like I see all the apps that I use on a daily basis. Everything just excites me. I never seen such a place ever in my life. Yeah, right. No, no. The fact that I live in London, Dubai, Singapore, whatever, it's not the same.

Yeah, I'm just wondering where do you source your deal to get into pre seed and seed, that's hard, yes, it's hard to get those deals enhanced.
S Speaker 131:01So I agree Eric and I think I have developed a few sourcing channels, which I think is working for me. A few of those areas would be first, I've tried to be very consciously on ground. I see a lot of these, like you mentioned. SF is so so dense in terms of companies coming up every time. So I have been able to, after a lot of hit and trial, figure out the right communities, the right kind of events, the right spaces where I need to be, the right demo days, which which communities are hosting which events. So I try to be there. I try to see a lot of companies. I have my own internal system of an Excel where I track a lot of companies. I've created some agentic systems there, where I see which companies to reach out where and when, and then I want something that when I'm meeting companies through in person events, something that I really try to do is see if I can add value to them. This is early stage. They may have a lot of technical depth. They may not have something in marketing, or they may not have one particular point of view. And also being in venture means that I have been speaking to 10 different kind of companies building around the same area, trying to enter that market with a different wedge. So I bring some of those insights. I try to act as a sounding board early on and see if that way, I can form a relationship with the founder or not, and try to sort of for keep following up on that at times. I've also tried to see if we can, I can, I can leverage some Qualcomm business units and get them a contract, get them some connection with the Qualcomm business unit, try to see if, if some of those things I can open up, other than that, also very consciously trying to form connections with different venture funds. There are a lot of venture communities that I'm part of, across slack, WhatsApp, regular there are weekly cadences which happen. So I've tried to be there if, when I'm sourcing a lot of deals through in person meetings, I realize that I cannot invest in 95% of them. It does not fit my thesis, it does not fit my stage, but I make sure I send these deals to these venture funds, and they they return the favor quite graciously. They understand where my thesis is. So I've been getting some really good deal flow from different venture funds as well, and then haven't done this so much, but I do feel founders would be a very big deal flow source as well, trying to sort of see if there are some really well connected founders who I can be very close to and attract deal flow from there. So I have a few targets in mind. I want to foster those relationships a little bit more, and that would also be a source I will, I will develop in this in the recent future.

S Speaker 233:37Makes total sense, I think makes total sense, right? And it's super hard. I think that there's, there's no right, wrong, to to, like, all those questions you just, just try to see where, where you're gonna click in. Because, honestly, we're always changing our strategy, always changing our thesis is always the same. My strategy is always changing because, like, web three, we are definitely top, top five, yeah, no doubt, yeah. We can get this new AI man, we're like, right 300 even outcome is probably a lot better than us in terms of AI view. But that's exactly where I find it challenging, but also attractiveness. Yeah, honestly, thanks bridge for the answer like, answers to like, some of the just conversations, like, stuff I just been throwing out.

S Speaker 134:32any of something. I've been wondering a little bit about Eric, is that I don't come from a web three background. I have some, some smaller investments in crypto and stuff like that, but I don't really, I haven't spent time in that space. So is that, will that be a blocker in terms of how you are, the kind of people you're looking for to add in the team,
any of something. I've been wondering a little bit about Eric, is that I don't come from a web three background.

S Speaker 234:54100% because the one that I'm assigned to the recruiter, and also what I'm trying to find, well, just trying purely in AI space, purely Ai no web three experience required, because AI web three completely different in terms of, like, the skill sets. Because for us, even for myself, web three, I learned it because I just always make a trigger. I think it's like 2018 in crypto space, but my skill set is essentially like, machine learning. Yeah, I don't know all this machine like, back in the days, like I did my master during the TensorFlow, that was, like, long, long time ago, right? Like, so that's like, my era back then, of course, now it's like, okay, back then, there was no AI, right? Come on, man, dude, every day I would just do, we were just doing data tagging, right, let alone AI, right? There was no air or air back then, right? Because the fact that you can get some TensorFlow to generate some predictions markets, that's about it. Yeah, you know what I mean, yeah. So, yeah. So anyway, answer your question, though, it doesn't it's not a block quick, it's not

S Speaker 236:16on, we are very worried, of course. Firstly, we are not agnostics. I will use the word is a synopsis, obviously. But at the same time, we invest very heavily in infra, both over three and Dei, very much, very, very heavily infra by means, decentralized training model, for example, decentralized inverse model, you know what I mean, right? Yeah. And even looking at a lot of those decentralized GPUs, even though that's like probably bullshit, because still very early in terms of different centralized GPUs. Because honestly, right? If you ask me, my head go, Oh, I love it, right? Like, I'm sure you have laptop, you have a PC, right? Like, you have GPUs that's not being utilized. I would love to be able to just rent out my GPU to someone else that can just use it and really be above for it. You know what? I mean? Yeah, yeah. So anyway, that's I need to stay. We're nowhere near that. But anyway, I'm just saying that we do have, we do invest a lot, really around in one or two is more like a launchpad, Launchpad, meaning that is a AI company, but they have this Launchpad word. It's like a GitHub, a decentralized GitHub. You basically do your model. You basically put your model on it. Anyone can utilize it. You can use it and basically pay up for it. So all these different stuff that we've invested together,
on, we are very worried, of course. Firstly, we are not agnostics. I will use the word is a synopsis, obviously.

So all these different stuff that we've invested together,
S Speaker 137:34very, very interesting. Eric, that that makes a lot of sense. I've seen a lot of infrastructure companies also evaluate many of them. Do you just a last question from an valuation point of view, a lot of these AI companies are super highly valued, valued right now, very hard. There is probably a bubble, even at the pre seed seed level. Is that something that the fund is a little bit concerned about? Are you valuation sensitive? Is is what I'm getting at
very, very interesting. Eric, that that makes a lot of sense. I've seen a lot of infrastructure companies also evaluate many of them.

S Speaker 238:02very, very good question. I will use the word we're definitely concerned, because we purely just want to do PC to see anything that's higher. Okay, that's why I said, sometimes I made a joke on your 100 50 million, right? Like, if 100 million is a big amount, but if you just keep doing a series B, do two deals three days, you can just lay back and chill for this whole year, right? You don't want to, but what I'm trying to say is that we are definitely concerned. We pay very high attention. We always try to stick below 30 minute mark in terms of the FTB, that's what we try to do. So anything above, we are very cautious. We ask ourselves twice, do we want to do it? Because how many one millions can you get? You know, how many, like, if you just go aggressively, I can, I can finish the 1 million, like, like, 100 million within like, a month. Yeah, so yes, I'm definitely forever in the bushes. I just want to stick to exactly what we can afford to do, by means investing in pre seed to seed and then try to realize the fund. So the way I always invest is very simple. I ask myself one question whenever I look at one, one, can I return a bug? Yeah, if I can return the fund, I'll do it
very, very good question. I will use the word we're definitely concerned, because we purely just want to do PC to see anything that's higher. Okay, that's why I said, sometimes I made a joke on your 100 50 million, right?

Yeah, so yes, I'm definitely forever in the bushes. I just want to stick to exactly what we can afford to do, by means investing in pre seed to seed and then try to realize the fund. So the way I always invest is very simple. I ask myself one question whenever I look at one, one, can I return a bug? Yeah, if I can return the fund, I'll do it
very, very good question. I will use the word we're definitely concerned, because we purely just want to do PC to see anything that's higher. Okay, that's why I said, sometimes I made a joke on your 100 50 million, right? Like, if 100 million is a big amount, but if you just keep doing a series B, do two deals three days, you can just lay back and chill for this whole year, right? You don't want to, but what I'm trying to say is that we are definitely concerned. We pay very high attention.

S Speaker 139:20totally makes sense. Eric, makes sense. We had this discussion within our team little earlier this time and this year. And I think we came to a very similar conclusion that we have to be financially disciplined in this market. It's very easily to sort of just go with the flow and get there, because you have some really amazing teams building some really cool stuff, but in the end, you have to follow Financial certificate. Yeah,

S Speaker 239:48there's so many of the brains, yeah. How do you pick the right one? For example, just chatgpt, like, just most basic, right? You have chatgpt, your capacity. You have wrong pick the wrong one. You don't know, I know that if you look at the tab, right, there's a lot of that's, it's a huge meat, it's a huge pie, right? So you definitely need three people or four people in the same market. Just look at Apple, Samsung, Huawei, whatever they want to be. So, but it's about like, I said, like you said, as well. It's about finding the right team. That's like, when you look at PC to see it's all other people, nothing else, like the market. Yes, this guy needs to take the feedback well, but if they just keep taking feedback, that's a red flag, because it means that this guy has no thinking. But if they don't take any feedback, then this guy is definitely not on the ball. So it's a love hate thing. It's about just finding the right measure,
