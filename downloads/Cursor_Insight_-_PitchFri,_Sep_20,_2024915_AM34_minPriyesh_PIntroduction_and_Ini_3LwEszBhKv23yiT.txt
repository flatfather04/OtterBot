S Speaker 10:40and you absolutely, pretty good. Are you based out of New York?
and you absolutely, pretty good. Are you based out of New York?
and you absolutely, pretty good. Are you based out of New York?
and you absolutely, pretty good. Are you based out of New York?
S Speaker 20:51Yes, London UK and Hungary, so Europe based? Yeah, got

Yes, London UK and Hungary, so Europe based? Yeah, got
S Speaker 10:55it. Got it. So I guess in that case, for a follow up call, we will have to route it through our London team. Have you ever interfaced with any of my colleagues in London?

S Speaker 21:11that you cover the US holiday, but yeah, no
S Speaker 11:14problem. We can. We can absolutely have an initial discussion, and then I'll pass it over to you. It's always good to sort of continued discussion myself, but no, no worries at all. I can, I can pass it on to them for the follow up conversations. But well, great connecting Tomas. I had gone through your brief presentation during the New York Tech Week, and I could not attend a conference in person, so I was on zoom back then. But would love to sort of read go through the entire process. I'm sure you would have a lot more to say, given that the presentation was pretty short, and I myself have a lot of questions around how you're going about the technology. So we can cover that. And I guess before we deep dive into that, I can give you an overview about the fund, how we operate? What sort of areas do we look at and repack about myself as well, and then we can take it over from there. How does that sound? Sounds good? Absolutely. So. I am a Senior Associate here at Qualcomm ventures. I take a look at the US investment as a geography and my focus area particularly are in ai, ai, applications infrastructure, broadly as a fund, we also look at IoT or industrial automation. Cyber security is an area we have in US investment team. We have a person dedicated to cyber security, and he's sort of an subject matter expert in this sector. We take a look at the XR enterprise SaaS as well. Right now, I guess we have had a lot of investments in computer vision and IoT based solutions, and more recently, we have had a lot of investments in AI infrastructure. So AI applications is a space that we are also very keenly looking at. Typically, the fund we aim to invest roughly around 180 $280 million in us. There is not a strong mandate, I mean, not a very defined mandate for UK investment. So it's more opportunistic there. But I'm sure my colleagues would be able to tell you more about that. And then we are a global friend. So we have offices in us, Israel, UK, China, India and Latin America. So we operate globally. We invest out of Qualcomm's balance sheet, and while we have very strategic ties with Qualcomm, our decisions are more independent, so we operate as a financial fund as well.
problem. We can. We can absolutely have an initial discussion, and then I'll pass it over to you. It's always good to sort of continued discussion myself, but no, no worries at all.

3:55No, no, it all makes sense. I mean, obviously I, you know,
No, no, it all makes sense. I mean, obviously I, you know,
No, no, it all makes sense. I mean, obviously I, you know,
No, no, it all makes sense. I mean, obviously I, you know,
S Speaker 23:57I tried on the website that you have a quite a quite nice portfolio. And
I tried on the website that you have a quite a quite nice portfolio. And
I tried on the website that you have a quite a quite nice portfolio. And
I tried on the website that you have a quite a quite nice portfolio. And
S Speaker 24:03platforms like face, of course. I saw the lot of computer vision companies in China and elsewhere, right? And also the cyber security companies like Sentinel one. So, yeah, kind of
platforms like face, of course. I saw the lot of computer vision companies in China and elsewhere, right? And also the cyber security companies like Sentinel one. So, yeah, kind of
platforms like face, of course. I saw the lot of computer vision companies in China and elsewhere, right? And also the cyber security companies like Sentinel one. So, yeah, kind of
platforms like face, of course. I saw the lot of computer vision companies in China and elsewhere, right? And also the cyber security companies like Sentinel one. So, yeah, kind of
S Speaker 14:19absolutely. Center one is doing really well. We are very excited about it. But yes,
absolutely. Center one is doing really well. We are very excited about it. But yes,
absolutely. Center one is doing really well. We are very excited about it. But yes,
absolutely. Center one is doing really well. We are very excited about it. But yes,
S Speaker 24:28so you want me to to start from the beginning, or do you want to just build on, on the presentation?
so you want me to to start from the beginning, or do you want to just build on, on the presentation?
so you want me to to start from the beginning, or do you want to just build on, on the presentation?
so you want me to to start from the beginning, or do you want to just build on, on the presentation?
S Speaker 14:33I think if you, if you can briefly jog my mind, yeah, about the product, that would be great. And then we can deep dive into specific questions and how things are going. Yeah. Okay,
I think if you, if you can briefly jog my mind, yeah, about the product, that would be great. And then we can deep dive into specific questions and how things are going. Yeah. Okay,
I think if you, if you can briefly jog my mind, yeah, about the product, that would be great. And then we can deep dive into specific questions and how things are going. Yeah. Okay,
I think if you, if you can briefly jog my mind, yeah, about the product, that would be great. And then we can deep dive into specific questions and how things are going. Yeah. Okay,
S Speaker 213:16cases. We got invited to the NATO Headquarters later in October, where we're gonna pitch to 120 basically, defense after series from all over. So it's, it's gaining traction. We are being considered for is the European Defense Fund project, which is 10s of millions. So it's, it's all happening very quickly. And basically the reason why we're fundraising now is to, is to build on this momentum and at higher, you know, build those kind of market connections, and hire those kind of sales people already embedded in this and hire those lobbyists that the way, you know, the way it works, requires a lot of pre sales and investment into it, and of course, also to finish the cyber security platform so that we can compete with the likes of bio catch or behavior cycle trademark, who whose technology, according to what we hear from clients, is inferior, to ours when it comes to continuous authentication, but they have a lot a lot of other more general cybersecurity or for detection tools, so they tick a lot more boxes for these clients. So in order for us to be able to compete with them, we just need to put together, you know, this more simpler solution. So that's that
cases. We got invited to the NATO Headquarters later in October, where we're gonna pitch to 120 basically, defense after series from all over. So it's, it's gaining traction.

S Speaker 214:48started with that the building, the ultimate motion analysis. Ai,
started with that the building, the ultimate motion analysis. Ai,
started with that the building, the ultimate motion analysis. Ai,
started with that the building, the ultimate motion analysis. Ai,
S Speaker 215:26so that's what generates around a million in ARR, yeah. And most of it is licensing fee and maintenance, maintenance, and also for our biggest client, the service contract, where it just spent, you know, spend, like, around 200,000 on us every year, ordering, you know, just new features and and
so that's what generates around a million in ARR, yeah. And most of it is licensing fee and maintenance, maintenance, and also for our biggest client, the service contract, where it just spent, you know, spend, like, around 200,000 on us every year, ordering, you know, just new features and and

15:52and change requests basically based on how they
S Speaker 215:55how their back end and integrations change in the background, so that that's how it looks like. And so the reason it's not growing is because, as I said, what we are good at is this Hamilton based signature. So whatever there is a face to face transaction, for example, in a bank branch or in other clients. We have our clinics, you know, someone walk in and design your, you know, data processing
how their back end and integrations change in the background, so that that's how it looks like.

S Speaker 216:30and then hospitality Could, could be another one. So we have, like supermarket, but like a store chain as a client, where they, you know, sometimes clients will sign up to black different programs, or the or the suppliers. When they ship something to the warehouse, they sign in and sign stuff. So, so it's like, it's not, it's not really a growing market, because I said electro signatures are becoming a commodity, just was it a month, two months ago, even Google came up with their own solution, right? So
and then hospitality Could, could be another one.

So
S Speaker 117:05Absolutely, absolutely. I understand that legislation. Yeah, so that's the story. I understand that
Absolutely, absolutely. I understand that legislation. Yeah, so that's the story. I understand that
Absolutely, absolutely. I understand that legislation. Yeah, so that's the story. I understand that
Absolutely, absolutely. I understand that legislation. Yeah, so that's the story. I understand that
S Speaker 217:12we would require about three people to run the business. Got it.
we would require about three people to run the business. Got it.
we would require about three people to run the business. Got it.
we would require about three people to run the business. Got it.
S Speaker 117:15Got it. That's That's not bad, for sure. I think
S Speaker 217:21about East European wages. So if you think about people, like cost of people divided by three, and then you get our cost
about East European wages. So if you think about people, like cost of people divided by three, and then you get our cost
about East European wages. So if you think about people, like cost of people divided by three, and then you get our cost
about East European wages. So if you think about people, like cost of people divided by three, and then you get our cost
S Speaker 117:30Absolutely. So Thomas, how long of let's say data samples do you need for you to for both, let's say handwriting recognition and for cursor identification, how long of a data sample you need for you to make this question? Gonna give you numbers?
Absolutely. So Thomas, how long of let's say data samples do you need for you to for both, let's say handwriting recognition and for cursor identification, how long of a data sample you need for you to make this question? Gonna give you numbers?
Absolutely. So Thomas, how long of let's say data samples do you need for you to for both, let's say handwriting recognition and for cursor identification, how long of a data sample you need for you to make this question? Gonna give you numbers?
Absolutely. So Thomas, how long of let's say data samples do you need for you to for both, let's say handwriting recognition and for cursor identification, how long of a data sample you need for you to make this question? Gonna give you numbers?
S Speaker 217:51Before I give you numbers, I have to say that, of course, it depends, you know, and the longer we have, the more accurate the predictions are. But So for, for handwriting, the industry standard, or is 10 signatures, we brought it down to basically five, and it's still our error rates are below 1% and for, for being able to build biometric profile from cursor movement, it depends on how you use the So, for example, if you're only, I don't know, playing Minecraft or whatever, always that's where we have to authenticate you. Versus, if you're doing all kinds of things on your computer, sometimes zoom calls, sometimes you work in excess. Sometimes do stuff in combat, whatnot. Then That, of course, we require and sometimes, you know,
Before I give you numbers, I have to say that, of course, it depends, you know, and the longer we have, the more accurate the predictions are.

Then That, of course, we require and sometimes, you know,
S Speaker 218:48you have three coffees. Sometimes you work standing up. Sometimes you work on the train. So there are a lot of factors, you know, but normally it's, it's going to be a couple of hours, or maybe 10 to 20 hours, yes, so we talked about workforce authentication. That's normally collectible in a week. Let's say if you, if you work like five hours a day, like when you, when you generate motion. We also partnered with the leader, and we're leader in typing biometrics, type in DNA. So now I mentioned this client where we're waiting for the approval, which is, by the way, like a $600,000 project. So we're we're going to combine, we're going to license typing dynamics, typing biometrics, of typing DNA, so we're putting them together. It becomes more accurate and requires total of less training time, basically when we can learn from both new typing and also moving the cursor, which you normally don't do at the same time. And then when it comes to so that's for building the profiles, and, of course, when it comes to evaluation. So
you have three coffees. Sometimes you work standing up. Sometimes you work on the train. So there are a lot of factors, you know, but normally it's, it's going to be a couple of hours, or maybe 10 to 20 hours, yes, so we talked about workforce authentication.

20:03less than a minute, or, let's say, 30 seconds.
S Speaker 220:12We can do, we can, we can build a lot of from about five, six steps.
We can do, we can, we can build a lot of from about five, six steps.
We can do, we can, we can build a lot of from about five, six steps.
We can do, we can, we can build a lot of from about five, six steps.
S Speaker 120:19Got it. Got it. That's That's pretty interesting. So Thomas, tell me this, let's say if you're if your target clients are financial institutions, and correct me if I'm wrong. But I can imagine a user not spending more than 1015, minutes on a financial institution page for some time. So does that become a big friction point for you in terms of creating that biometric profile?
Got it. Got it. That's That's pretty interesting. So Thomas, tell me this, let's say if you're if your target clients are financial institutions, and correct me if I'm wrong.

20:49Yeah, so it will require a couple of sessions. You're
Yeah, so it will require a couple of sessions. You're
Yeah, so it will require a couple of sessions. You're
Yeah, so it will require a couple of sessions. You're
S Speaker 220:52absolutely right, by the way. So this is what our competitors are doing as well. So we are from biocatch. It takes, you know, one year to integrate and another year to test build the profile. So, so yeah, for the frequent users, it's
absolutely right, by the way. So this is what our competitors are doing as well. So we are from biocatch. It takes, you know, one year to integrate and another year to test build the profile. So, so yeah, for the frequent users, it's

S Speaker 221:10couple of weeks, let's say, for the less frequent users, more. But again, I mean, it's going to become, so two things. So this is why I think actually the workforce, authentication use cases struck around.
couple of weeks, let's say, for the less frequent users, more. But again, I mean, it's going to become, so two things. So this is why I think actually the workforce, authentication use cases struck around.

S Speaker 221:26closer to closing this deal there. And also, I mean, we're always, you know,
closer to closing this deal there. And also, I mean, we're always, you know,
closer to closing this deal there. And also, I mean, we're always, you know,
closer to closing this deal there. And also, I mean, we're always, you know,
S Speaker 221:38like, kind of like a fraud detection system with this, this would be one flag, basically, that we will provide, and of course, we also can provide, like we do, device fingerprinting and some contextual analysis. So behavior analysis, it's already building out the platform that I, that I talked about, but, yeah, you're absolutely right. I mean, it takes, it takes some time to build a profile.
like, kind of like a fraud detection system with this, this would be one flag, basically, that we will provide, and of course, we also can provide, like we do, device fingerprinting and some contextual analysis.

S Speaker 122:05Can you, yeah, God can tell me a little bit more about the contextual analysis, behavioral analysis part of it. What sort of data points are you trying to capture from there? And how would you, how would that change the systems paradigm? Yeah,
Can you, yeah, God can tell me a little bit more about the contextual analysis, behavioral analysis part of it. What sort of data points are you trying to capture from there? And how would you, how would that change the systems paradigm? Yeah,

S Speaker 222:20so we built something that we also patented it, which is a solution where there's a type of fraud that support fraud, where the hackers will make the victims download a remote desktop tool, like any desk, and then they will let you As the client login use, all the pass, all the NFA device fingerprinting and everything we check, and then they take over the session. So we designed something that was bought the very, very small, invisible kind of anomalies in a remote desktop session in terms of cursor motion. But for example, here this, we complemented with some contextual analysis. By analyzing, you know, what kind of transaction you are doing. I mean, there are some simple things, like, is it the new beneficiary is your you know, the the amount that you're trying to transfer, very unusual compared to your your history and and. So for workforce authentication, you, you know we are looking for things whether you are signing in in an unusual time, for example, like at 2am when you usually just work from from nine to five. So these are just a few examples. There's a there's a set of this kind of, kind of more like rule based Yeah,
so we built something that we also patented it, which is a solution where there's a type of fraud that support fraud, where the hackers will make the victims download a remote desktop tool, like any desk, and then they will let you As the client login use, all the pass, all the NFA device fingerprinting and everything we check, and then they take over the session.

S Speaker 123:44got it. And for you to create these contextual analysis part of things, I guess that will be very different from for different use cases. So it will be very different from workflow, workforce analysis versus a financial institution use case. Do you think that's a hindrance in terms of scale, or it's, it's more simple in deployment,
got it. And for you to create these contextual analysis part of things, I guess that will be very different from for different use cases.

S Speaker 224:03no, no. I mean, you're right. It's gonna, I mean, the the values or the thresholds are going to be different for for for clients, and then even, you know, if the client operates in various markets, be different as well. But these are all like kind of self learning models. You can just, you can just train the normal usage, and then if there's a divergence, and that's that's got it, so we're not, it doesn't really make sense to design like a general model for this. But this is the I mean also, if just talk about the motion analysis part. This is the when I mentioned the hundreds of 1000s of features, and then we select, like a few 100, maybe for a model, we can actually select different features for each person. I'm just going to give you a very simple, oversimplified example. Okay, so just think about handwriting recognition, which we basically do, and recognize signatures. So it might be that in your signature, you know, there's sorry for the example. So, you know, you're going to talk your eyes in a very unique way, in a very unique way, and that's going to define their signature, and it's going to be part of that. And someone will have a very funny way of making the loop of their of their piece, you know? So this is the kind of, also the strength of the technology, that we can build very personalized profiles. There's white kind of flexibility of the of the system in this regard as well?
no, no. I mean, you're right. It's gonna, I mean, the the values or the thresholds are going to be different for for for clients, and then even, you know, if the client operates in various markets, be different as well.

There's white kind of flexibility of the of the system in this regard as well?
S Speaker 226:00Yeah. I mean, I mean, the first idea that we had, and when we started working together with polycombinota, was we have robotics, which is, which is like a smart camera company. I mean, that the idea was to just sell it to kind of office buildings and industrial plants where they just want to make sure that there's no kind of tailgating at the access points, and there is no, like, playing around with the XF, the RFI, the access cards, because, like, in a kind of manufacturing environment, you know, like, it sometimes happens that someone is on leave or sick and they just, you know, keeps his car to, like, his nephew or whatever, just walks into the, you know, walks into the shop floor or whatever. So, so these kind of things make and without, without using, like, sensitive biometrics, or installing extra hardware, like fingerprint scanner or or facial recognition camera, if you, if you have, like, just one CCTV camera around the the entry point that our style, basically, yeah, then we can, we can already use, like, again, segment length calculations and motion analysis to make sure that you're the you Know You're, you're the person who you know, actually is issued that access card. So that would be my solution. But we also, we also spoke with like Toyota, who wanted to make sure that the the forklifts are in the warehouses are not causing that they make a lot of forklifts so that they're like accident prevention. So yeah, that there are quite a few industrial use cases. And then, and then, I mean, I don't know if you saw you are pitch deck. And if you click on one of the links, you can see a very cool like, drone based video, concept video where we recognize people walking. So we from from drone footage. So there are quite a few, as I said, that will use use cases where the drones are heavily involved. So that would be more like military and not security, yeah. So, I mean, there are a lot of, I mean, we actually submitted an offer to a huge, well, let's say NATO ally country, and where they would have used this for a airport security application, so making sure they can they can track people at the airports, even if they you know, change the bathroom their clothes, and making sure whoever you know walk through the check in is the same guy who walks through the on the plane. And also we, we got invited to an RFP by by neon, the, you know, the big Smart City and the trillion dollar big city, smart city in Saudi to implement something, again, in the smart city, being able to track people, identify people, you know, commit a crime, or whatever. Of course, that that project was scaled back by the Saudis. So that's put on board. So, yeah. I mean, this is so these are the examples that I mentioned where these are, like, completely inbound requests from all over places. Just one more sentence, and they all keep telling us that this product that we would, that we are working on, like, doesn't exist. So that everyone told us they know that, you know, they scan the whole market. Everyone who claims they have like gate recognition, don't really have it, so they understand that everyone is just doing it, and we look like someone knows what they're doing. So so this is something where we can really beat the absolute first movers, where we're next week, I
Yeah. I mean, I mean, the first idea that we had, and when we started working together with polycombinota, was we have robotics, which is, which is like a smart camera company.

S Speaker 230:30We need to, we need these to keep coming and being able to do POCs, because that's the way to get into these deals, and which, of course, then we can turn into licensing and recurring revenue deals.

S Speaker 130:45Absolutely. Thomas, this, this sounds interesting. I think you have a very strong horizontal tech which can expand into a lot of application areas. I will, I will do this, tamas, I will create a small proposition from my and then pass it on to my London team, and then I'll connect you to them to sort of take the conversation over from there, I guess a couple of things which will be useful for me to just sort of create my own analysis. Would be if you can send me some details on the tech stack. What kind of data points do you track? How do you compare against the current providers in different segments? I guess we broadly talked about three segments. One is cursor, biometric video analysis, and let's say fingerprint, sorry, sign analysis, let's, let's, for now, skip the sign analysis part. But for the other two, if you can send me something around the tech stack that would be useful, and anything around your current traction and the pipeline you are looking at that with those two data points, I'd love to make an introduction with the learner team, and then you can take it over. From there.

S Speaker 231:55I will send you a slightly longer version of our pitch deck, yeah. So in terms of the technology, you know. I mean, we have, you know, I'm happy to work on, I mean, the tech stack. I mean, I can tell, you know, I'm the Business founder, by the way, but, I mean, you know, the way, the so we, we cannot disclose a lot of things, but actually what we can this, we already have.
