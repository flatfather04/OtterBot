S Speaker 21:15yeah, how are you we're doing. We're doing good. You know, we're digging into this space of the ball and, you know, trying to understand what the big players are doing. And, you know, partly, part of the reason to sync up today was just to understand how things are progressing on your end, and kind of see how the market developments have impacted, or, you know, put any pressure on how fast you can fundraise. So I did see a checkpoint acquiring laquera Just this week, that was a good acquisition, it seems like because laquere wasn't growing as fast, from what I understand, right? And I, I don't know if you have a perspective on you know how, how the market sees la cara versus witness, or even if, mostly if they bucket them into the same bucket, right? If you guys compete, but, but I know that company, we've been talking to them as well, but they were at a two 3 million Arr, kind of got acquired for 300 million. So it was kind of 100x so,
yeah, how are you we're doing. We're doing good. You know, we're digging into this space of the ball and, you know, trying to understand what the big players are doing.

2:19very expensive. But,
S Speaker 32:20yeah, yeah. It seems like I didn't think well. Cara was doing very well, although they were probably doing better than most of the others. I mean, Pangea got bought for 280 they had $380,000

S Speaker 32:37It feels to me like if you aren't doing very well. 250 to 300 is where you can take it out right now, which is pretty funny,

S Speaker 22:46which is not a bad deal. You know, for one of these startups that 200 300 I mean, I would think, if you know the market's so competitive, and majority of them won't get acquired or won't even scale, right? There will be a few that will break out.

S Speaker 33:06So for us, you know, we're tracking the plan. Like my plan was to do 7 million my first year. This year, we're well our way. I'm in three, four at the end of q2 I've got 24 million in pipe for the rest of this year, like it's all cooking. So we see a nice path through seven and potentially as high as 10. I've closed Delta Airlines, number one, airline, Charles Schwab, number one, retail, financial, Southern Company. Number two, utility in the country, NTT, number three telco in the world, all large deals. So we put 150,000 NTT employees into production in 10 days from last night. And I just closed my MSA with Toyota, so we're working on the first quote from Toyota. So we never want to call it a maker. I feel like we're cooking pretty well, moving along pretty well. I just started the B, so I don't know if he's going to have any impact on my B. It's like I'm a week into it, but, yeah, no, I'll have second and third meetings with firms already.

S Speaker 24:55of course, of course. So for the dinner, I think you haven't met the head of Qualcomm ventures North America yet. So wanted to do two things, firstly, get you to introduce and connect with Tushar, he's the head of Qualcomm ventures. And the second thing was, I think this was about the time when you were kick starting the funding, so it would be good to get the whole team involved, you know, Priyesh and me, but you know, and also understanding how Qualcomm operates, right? And the third thing I wanted to sync up today, Rick was we would like to also start educating Qualcomm, the parent company, on how they can leverage witness. So any past conversations with Qualcomm that you've had,
of course, of course. So for the dinner, I think you haven't met the head of Qualcomm ventures North America yet.

S Speaker 26:23Sounds good, sounds good. So let's, let's do that. And what is the timeline that you you're looking at? I would love to stay connected, and, you know, keep up with it, with the timeline of the process. Yeah, well,

S Speaker 36:34I assume it's going to go relatively quickly. I'm trying to pick a lead now and then I'll have my lead. The Insiders will take their Prada and beyond, or I can squish them down lower to make room. I have a couple of follow on firms that want to not lead, but put 10 to 15 behind that. And then I have three or four strategics that are floating around. So it's going to be I'm trying to figure out how to construct the round to give everyone what they're looking for here and still keep it in a reasonable amount and valuation.

S Speaker 27:10And do you have any flexibility on the total raise from the board or yourself?
And do you have any flexibility on the total raise from the board or yourself?
And do you have any flexibility on the total raise from the board or yourself?
And do you have any flexibility on the total raise from the board or yourself?
S Speaker 37:16Well, the board wants me to raise 24 months. Wants me to raise money. Yeah, so that is 50 to 60 million. I think less than 50, I'm back out again before 24 more than 60, I'm either diluting or I have to ask for some stupid valuation that I can't grow into, of course. So I'm sorry, I don't think, I think it's between 5060
Well, the board wants me to raise 24 months. Wants me to raise money. Yeah, so that is 50 to 60 million.

So I'm sorry, I don't think, I think it's between 5060
S Speaker 27:41between 5060 Got it, got it. And maybe one question right that, you know, we've had a couple of discussions internally, but one question that has come up is, you know, you're solving for, you know, the first pain point, which is visibility right into what apps do you have? What you know, reports the shadow IT usage, and then you probably have some bit of prompt protection, and, you know, protection against confidential data, and a lot of lot of features on top of it, right? So how much of the revenues today would be from, and I don't know if you sell the product that way, but how much of it is visibility versus, you know, all the other products. Do you package it that way?
between 5060 Got it, got it.

S Speaker 38:24Yeah? Think of it like this. Think of it as I have two big use cake. I was just digging up a slide to walk you through it. So, Oh, that'll be easier if I just go to the slide.
Yeah? Think of it like this. Think of it as I have two big use cake. I was just digging up a slide to walk you through it. So, Oh, that'll be easier if I just go to the slide.

S Speaker 28:35Yeah. Sorry, we could have come prepared. If you have the date. Look what we'll do is, once you send it, let us dig walk
Yeah. Sorry, we could have come prepared. If you have the date. Look what we'll do is, once you send it, let us dig walk
Yeah. Sorry, we could have come prepared. If you have the date. Look what we'll do is, once you send it, let us dig walk
Yeah. Sorry, we could have come prepared. If you have the date. Look what we'll do is, once you send it, let us dig walk
S Speaker 38:43you through it really quickly. Let me just take you five minutes, because otherwise I'm just waving my hands around and the screen. Okay, so think of it like this. I had three big use cases I go after. The first one, which is most developed, is corporate employees using third party AI, chat, gptc, 5000 others. When I sell this, in some cases, I start with visibility only and add the policy enforcement guardrails later. Ntts that we started with observability, now they're backed by policy enforcement most other people, they do the whole thing like, give me visibility and give me two or three policy card rails, so I'm getting the whole thing. The second use case is the flip. This is like what the CARA does. This is the AI firewall. This is company stands up an internal model to their customers. Right now, I've got a bunch of deals that have popped up that are working on this quarter, my competitors here are entirely Palo Alto at Google. Yeah, it's entirely but for the first one, my competitors are entirely Netskope and Zscaler. For the second one, my competitors are entirely right now Palo and Google and we are now building the jetted part where we do the same, observability, policy, control, protection. But this is so early. I'm not selling this yet, really right now, everything's over here, and I would say right now, you know, I have customers who bought both of these two. So Delta Airlines bought 50,000 licenses for their employees and one license for the big AI Travel Planner they're putting on the website to sell
you through it really quickly. Let me just take you five minutes, because otherwise I'm just waving my hands around and the screen. Okay, so think of it like this.

S Speaker 211:06this might not be this final. And do you have any gap and, like, I know, it's chat, chat, GPT, DPC, and bunch of these external tools, right?

S Speaker 311:27yeah, there's, there's three levels of coverage, yeah, really far. But for something like writers calling one is, we see that you have employees going there. I can tell you which employees are going there, and I can let you block it or not. That's sort of like basic kindergarten level, even that's got value. The second one is, we've just added this. We just cracked it is to say, I see where you're going to see who the users are, prompt, and I apply policy to the prompt. We just figured out how to add roughly 2000 more apps with that. The next one is I see it, I see who you are, I see the prompt, and I also see the response, and I can control both. Technically, it's a little harder to do the response. We do that for a key set of apps, but we're figuring out how to do it for 1000s. There's a fourth one, which is for native apps on on your desktop. We kind of have to that was really hard to do. We do that for a bunch of things like Office compiling and stuff like that.

S Speaker 212:56And, you know, one question I had was a I was talking to the CTO of writer, and they are building their own agents, so you'll need coverage for writer the app itself and any development that they might have within the app as well, right? So how do you have to constantly, you know, keep it updated to track. Okay. They are using a small model for this use case, they have five agents. Find new agents deployed, and I get, I get it still in flux. I am not expecting a clear answer, but what are your thoughts on, how do you how do you monitor?

13:31Here's how we're taking it. So the
Here's how we're taking it. So the
Here's how we're taking it. So the
Here's how we're taking it. So the
S Speaker 313:35base case, remember, we live in the network. We monitor, yep, yep. So for any agents that are communicating over MCP that we see on the network, we can tell you which agents are in your network. They're talking over MCP. We can parse the protocol, do it that part. We already have prototypes running. Honestly, I probably should have shown you a demo. I don't. I didn't prepare to do a demo, but I can show you how the bigger one is not that, like someone using the writer agent is not going to be that. The bigger issue is someone builds an agent running on their machine and has access to the local machine, that part I can't pick up in the network because it never goes on the network. So we're looking at how we do that. Do we have to build, like, a plug in or endpoint agent? Yeah, and we can avoid it. So far, we're trying to figure out if we can just do observability and control network, or do we have to put something on the endpoint itself? Yeah, for local file system. Everything on that local file system we're pretty comfortable with,

So let's say if you have a sales agent, it is supposed to it's not rule based. It'll run at on runtime. It'll determine your natural language prompt implies calling these five tools, right? Or browsing the web or creating an Excel sheet or a PowerPoint, right? So it's calling multiple tools. So you probably see on your MCP network, you'll see the traffic for this particular agent.
