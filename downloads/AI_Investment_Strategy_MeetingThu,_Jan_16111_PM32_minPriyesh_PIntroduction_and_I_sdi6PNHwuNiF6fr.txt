S Speaker 11:35thanks a lot for reaching out. I went through the LinkedIn profile of s hash and frankly, couldn't understand a lot. So I'd be looking forward to getting how you are thinking about it, probably your voice over. But before we start, maybe I can give you a background about myself, a little bit about the ventures, how we operate, the things we look at, and then we'll pass it over to you from there. Sure. So Manisha, I currently work with Qualcomm ventures Senior Associate, and particularly looking at AI investments for the team, we have had a good amount of AI investments in the couple of past years, mostly in the foundation model and infrastructure layer. So we were into anthropic scale, AI, hugging, face weights and biases. Well said labs and a few other companies in those layers, and now we are very actively looking at the middleware tooling layer and the AI agents application layer as well. So that's where I think the focus for the firm this year would be. We are a global fund, so while we have an office in us. We have one in Brazil, one in Israel, one in India, China, and another one in UK. So Google fund, for that matter, we plan to deploy about $150 million a year in us, and then our check sizes would be somewhere between two to 10 million sweet spot around five to seven, that's what we aim to we have done smaller checks sometimes for seed companies, especially in AI and typically we try to come in at series A or later. But more recently, we realized for AI investments that's probably too late, so we have started doing seed as well for them, broadly that the fund, apart from Ai, we look at IoT, computing, semiconductors, robotics, ar, VR, industrial automation, supply chain. So anything, if you see, if there's an angle of compute or connectivity, that's where we sort of play nice.

S Speaker 23:42It's cool, great, perfect. Yeah. I mean, I think yeah, that's the right spot for us too. So yeah, we are looking for pre seed and has hash, which stands for Secure hashing. Ai, okay, so where we build a secure Gen? AI, for enterprise confidential data. So what that means is, like, you know, any AI model, like what we have right now, so pretty much it takes all the data. So for the enterprise level data, like, you cannot just use it anywhere, yeah. So that's what we are building Gen AI, which is like, gonna be, you know, like, it's going to be like an AI agent as well as, like, you know, down the lane, we are building our own specific llms as well. But as of now, we are using a strong and also. But what it does is it will be able to do the entire AI capability, entire AI capability for the enterprise, without even sharing their data to us. So that would be like you could sell it as Gen AI as a service, so we're just directly connected to their database. They have everything accessed, and they can, you know, do from Document searching to research to summarization and all the way to New Document generations based upon what they have. So that is what we are doing. And currently the Department of Defense is much more interested with us, and we are working very closely with them. And as you know, with the government, things the contract, it's taking a long time, and we are working on it and to get the contract. But most of the investors with whom I talked, they were like, Okay, you're a first time founder. You have finished your computers and masters and worked in the Bay Area, as you know, software developer, for 16 plus years, but you're still a first time founder. So, you know, they come up with the contract and we would work with it. So this entire idea, it originated for me where, while I was working with Nvidia as a pilot, LLM engineer over there in 2018 to 2022 so that's when I realized, Okay, we are missing the security part here, and pretty much soon, everybody would be looking for and it's not just the DOD. We are also working with small companies like which are startups right now, which is ranging from web three, which where they want to implement AI, secure AI, to all the way to AI, financial advisor apps where they want to implement secure AI, so when the customer data is not leaked outside somewhere, kind of thing. So it goes and includes some of the legal forms small legal firms within the bay area as well. So and we are also in talks with New York Life Insurance, yeah, and case of Permanente, but the talks are going on for them. It's much more easier that if we get the DoD contract to prove to their higher officials why we are giving them so connected.

S Speaker 16:46Well, thanks for the overview that sounds interesting, and for sure, we understand and relate to the value that something like this would bring Qualcomm a big push in Edge compute, as you can imagine, we ship the most amount of processes for mobile devices. Now we have started our own cloud inferencing platform that'll take some time, but we have also gotten into AI compute for PCs. So we, we are making a big push for edge compute, and one of the pieces behind that is that you would need privacy for your data, and you don't want that compute to happen at the cloud. So So I understand that for sure. Can you tell me a little bit more about the architecture that you're thinking about? How is it very different from traditional applications? And I'm not a tech guy, but I try my best to understand, though, sure.

S Speaker 113:22that's very interesting. Magesh, so if understanding it correctly, you have different models for different verticals and different use cases, and then you have an orchestration layer on top of it to decide whether, when and which models would you need for a specific use case? That's pretty interesting at the point. At the moment, what's the use case that DOD is looking at, and what are you trying to build for them?
that's very interesting.

S Speaker 213:51So right now, so DOD, the department within the DOD which we are working is called DLA defense, logistic agency. So they have the entire logistic documentations, like armories and how they are selling, where they are going, and all those documents which they have to deal on daily basis, and they have to fill the forms which are pretty much the same kind of forms, but with different details kind of things. So we are trying to learn that data. Try to automate. It generate those documents automatically. It does not approve until the individual who has to do the documentation checks that and tells Hey, this is right. And then when they approve it, the document is automatically generated. That is one thing. And the second thing is, if they want to do the in order to do that, documentation, research, telling okay, it has provided some requirement ID. Is the requirement ID available in the database? And what is that? Is that matching this one, or is there any conflicts where you cannot use that? So there are different perspectives they are seeing before even signing a DLA paper, it across. So pretty much all those workflow for them, we are doing it. And pretty much when we talk about workflow, this is only for the DLA and similarly, the workflow change for different departments within the DOD. So we'll be working one on one closely as we keep going further. So as we are working very closely with the DLA. But we do also have some the next steps with the, you know, dia defense, I mean dai defense, agency of intelligence. So that is the next level with whom we will be working for and so pretty much like, you know, try to connect the

But we do also have some the next steps with the, you know, dia defense, I mean dai defense, agency of intelligence. So that is the next level with whom we will be working for and so pretty much like, you know, try to connect the
So right now, so DOD, the department within the DOD which we are working is called DLA defense, logistic agency. So they have the entire logistic documentations, like armories and how they are selling, where they are going, and all those documents which they have to deal on daily basis, and they have to fill the forms which are pretty much the same kind of forms, but with different details kind of things. So we are trying to learn that data. Try to automate. It generate those documents automatically. It does not approve until the individual who has to do the documentation checks that and tells Hey, this is right. And then when they approve it, the document is automatically generated. That is one thing. And the second thing is, if they want to do the in order to do that, documentation, research, telling okay, it has provided some requirement ID. Is the requirement ID available in the database? And what is that? Is that matching this one, or is there any conflicts where you cannot use that? So there are different perspectives they are seeing before even signing a DLA paper, it across. So pretty much all those workflow for them, we are doing it. And pretty much when we talk about workflow, this is only for the DLA and similarly, the workflow change for different departments within the DOD. So we'll be working one on one closely as we keep going further. So as we are working very closely with the DLA. But we do also have some the next steps with the, you know, dia defense, I mean dai defense, agency of intelligence. So that is the next level with whom we will be working for and so pretty much like, you know, try to connect the
S Speaker 115:44dots kind of thing. So let's say, if you're building for one workflow today, you also mentioned you plan to expand, or you have you're having conversations with financial in services, you're having conversation with universities. The workflows would be very different for each one of them. So do you plan to sort of train or fine tune a model specifically for each one of them? Or how is it going to do? And how are you thinking about scaling it?
dots kind of thing. So let's say, if you're building for one workflow today, you also mentioned you plan to expand, or you have you're having conversations with financial in services, you're having conversation with universities.

S Speaker 216:13So the scaling part is where, where I told that we'll be having three different models by every industry, large language models, medium language models and small language models. So we would be using those, because once we have one large language model which would install for that particular industry, will be good to talk, but we'll start with small, small language models and then try to build the medium and then to go with the match. So that is our goal, to go with every industry specific and the other to answer your other question, yes, we will have a separate into, I mean industry specific trained. I mean pre trained models for every separate industry. If it is educational, like universities, we'll have the pre trained with, only with university based documents. If it is legal firm, it would be only with legal firm based documents kind of things. The whole reason for that is, like, you know, all these hallucinations and other problems what we see right now, it's because we don't have that individualistic things. So we will first build the individualistic thing, and then on top of that, there will be another neural network which would be able to manage all these llms separately or individually to know based upon the weightages labeled on. I mean, that is our futuristic also. Let's leave that, but right now. Like, this is what we are going

S Speaker 117:44to that's that's interesting. Like, I do understand the broader vision. It makes sense to be living in a world like that. So, so what are the recent milestones, and when do you think some of these contracts would come to fruition? And how are you thinking about the next few months.
to that's that's interesting. Like, I do understand the broader vision. It makes sense to be living in a world like that. So, so what are the recent milestones, and when do you think some of these contracts would come to fruition? And how are you thinking about the next few months.

S Speaker 218:02Yes. So the recent milestone right now is we are, you know, working closely with the DOD to get, what do you call grants? You know, like, so the DOD, what they have sanctioned a grant which is not through SBIR STTR internally, through a theory where they say, Hey, we believe this startup is good. So the DoD grant comes directly to us. So that is what we are looking forward to, because with that, we will be able to expand it and our first main, the first main goal for us to make sure, like satisfy the Department of Defense with their requirements and whatever they want, and we have been successfully able to satisfy them so far. And so obviously we want to continue that. The reason is, all the futuristic big companies like New York Life Insurance case of permanent universities, they are asking one question, why you why not move, you know, so the DoD contract is one of the best things, but we can say DoD believes in us. They believe that we are the secure guys. And these DoD guys are really techie guys. They are not like, you know, some people like on the management level. These are like, they are in the management level, but still, they are also techie. They know what AI they know what AI. What does AI is what we are doing, or how that thing is working, code by code. They know it. So that's one of the advantages, where we will be able to get the word of mouth through our own customers and expand it to us and down the lane. We are also planning to go to India as well. But yes, our next goal is to get the grants, and then with the grants, we go and proceed to build the actual product. I mean, honestly, the product is complete right now. We have built the product. But you know, we cannot scale it because, like the DOD has given us one terabyte of data. So what that means is that we can use it for pre, pre training and all So, but the data, what they would be using, is pretty much more than one terabyte of data. So now we have to make sure that our product would be able to withstand, that it cannot crash. So that is where we need the AI infrastructure to test and, you know, do the endurance testing and all those things make sure, with the one terabyte data, what we have to make sure it works fine, and give it to the DoD telling, hey, this is what we have. And initially we will say it can support up to five terabyte of data. Because what we are planning to do is, with the one terabyte of data, we will generate synthetic data to 10 terabytes, and try to do all the testing and give them telling it will work up to five terabytes, and then, like slowly, we can increase the performance of that got
Yes. So the recent milestone right now is we are, you know, working closely with the DOD to get, what do you call grants?

interesting. So how long have you been at it?
interesting. So how long have you been at it?
S Speaker 222:35So we started the company in 2023 but I had this idea right from 2021 when I was with Nvidia. So I realized Nvidia had this class that I cannot start a company about my own. So I had to leave Nvidia in 2022 and then I tried to, you know, the only reason I left Nvidia and went to VMware was okay. This is the only thing I want. I want to remove this class, and then I'm fine, or else so and they were okay with it. And that's how then, you know, like to understand and try to do the startup and and pretty much in June of 2023, I started, I registered the company, and then immediately we got, like, within two or three months, we got Microsoft and Amazon programs, like, we got credits, so which was pretty good enough for us to have the use Cloud and infrastructure to build the MVP and go down the line. And just like last March, I mean, 2024 March, we completed our MVP and showed it to the DOD, and they were like, Yeah, we like it together, kind of, right. So,
So we started the company in 2023 but I had this idea right from 2021 when I was with Nvidia. So I realized Nvidia had this class that I cannot start a company about my own.

and how many members are in the team?
S Speaker 223:50So right now, we have four members in the team, like, but I'm the solo founder, but the team, which is a development team, it comprises of people from Harvard University.

S Speaker 124:21Interesting. Okay, so the plan for now is to win the DoD contract, prove your credibility, skill application there, and do you plan to raise some time down the line?
Interesting. Okay, so the plan for now is to win the DoD contract, prove your credibility, skill application there, and do you plan to raise some time down the line?

Interesting. Okay, so the plan for now is to win the DoD contract, prove your credibility, skill application there, and do you plan to raise some time down the line?
S Speaker 224:32I mean, we would be, I mean, as a startup, we'll be always looking for money, you know, so it would be much more easier for us to Okay. Grants will come. Because this grants we are working for the past six months right now, I think six to eight months. Yeah, eight months. So we don't know when it is going to happen. So if we get some kind of investment, it's good. So we'll be looking for at least, like, initial not too much. One of the reasons is, like, we know it's going to go back, so we don't want to give big chunk of the company at the same time, so we are considering that as well at the same time. We want to keep growing as we grow. But yeah, if you know, like, what happened to Ilia, Subscribe Like, you know, if giving clean out of 1 billion for 20% of state, yeah, obviously we're not. So that's a different
I mean, we would be, I mean, as a startup, we'll be always looking for money, you know, so it would be much more easier for us to Okay. Grants will come.

S Speaker 225:48Thank you so much. So when you talk about big money, what is the range you're talking about?
Thank you so much. So when you talk about big money, what is the range you're talking about?
Thank you so much. So when you talk about big money, what is the range you're talking about?
Thank you so much. So when you talk about big money, what is the range you're talking about?
S Speaker 125:52For us, because our check sizes are like we prefer to put in a 5 million to $7 million check. So I'm thinking, when you have some revenue in and say, if you have crossed a million dollars in ARR, you're raising a seed, you've you've raised a seed already, or you're raising a seed in series, a sometime around, that would be best for us to evaluate.

S Speaker 226:51in talking. Sounds great. And yeah. So I also had another question. So since you recently joined as a senior associate, I just wanted to know, like, so right now, you know, like, I'm just moving to another role and to another company so that I get extra high pay, so that I can support my startup much more better. So right now I've got two offers. Like, one is like, as a software architect, another one as a VP of engineering. So I'm just going to see, like, which one is going to pay me more go there, so worry about role or anything like that. So pretty much it's going to be the same. So I'm just waiting for it. But I was also thinking, how about I could also learn the VC industry as well. So do you have any inputs for me to how to join in as like you Jamaica, or is there any way of is it like all networking? Or is there the requirements are different? Or how do I apply for it? Can you give me some inputs? Yes,
in talking. Sounds great. And yeah. So I also had another question.

S Speaker 229:02Oh yeah, that'd be great. Yeah. I'm not looking for, literally, venture fellow one like, you know, I have, pretty much, if I go to another job, it will be either VP of engineering or software architect. So that is what I've been moving on to. So with that in mind, I was thinking more about, you know, pretty much as a venture partner or anything like that, so where I would be able to contribute. And at the same time, I'm looking for a full time where it can just pay me so that, like, you know, I don't need to work some extra job and take care of me start well altogether. Because right now I'm going for another job so that I'm going full time there so it pays me, and with that money, I could be able to do it on my no extra free time on my startup, and use that one. So that is the same mindset I have it so, but I thought, like, Okay, since I anyways, I'm jumping to a new job, so venture partner or something,
Oh yeah, that'd be great. Yeah.
