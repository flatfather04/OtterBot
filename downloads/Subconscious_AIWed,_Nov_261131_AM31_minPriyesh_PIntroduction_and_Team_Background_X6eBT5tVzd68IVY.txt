S Speaker 11:26I'm in the Bay Area. We most of the Qualcomm Ventures is based here, and then some members are in San Diego, where our headquarters is.

1:34All right, beautiful. I'm assuming you are based in New York, right?
All right, beautiful. I'm assuming you are based in New York, right?
All right, beautiful. I'm assuming you are based in New York, right?
All right, beautiful. I'm assuming you are based in New York, right?
1:38Normally, I'm in New York, yeah. Now I'm

S Speaker 11:42outside of DC. Got it, got it. And is that where the team is all based as well?
outside of DC. Got it, got it. And is that where the team is all based as well?
outside of DC. Got it, got it. And is that where the team is all based as well?

S Speaker 21:48No, our team is mostly in New York and then Northern Europe.
No, our team is mostly in New York and then Northern Europe.
No, our team is mostly in New York and then Northern Europe.
No, our team is mostly in New York and then Northern Europe.
S Speaker 11:53Got it, got it. So most of our team, I assume, is operating remotely for now, yeah, that's right, got it. And how big is the team? Avi, it's six of us. Okay, okay, got it. Avi, pleasure, pleasure to chat. I've been following this thesis for for some time, and I certainly believe there. I mean, a lot of companies are early in this space, but do see a future of synthetic human populations, doing a lot of research, plus product decisions, plus strategic decision work in the future. Do see a future where we would have say n is to one level of personalization, and this would be a huge technology powering that in the back end. So I'm quite interested in learning more. At the same time we I'll give you a brief about how the fund operates, my background and some of that part, but from a Qualcomm perspective, setting the context here what what we have been doing as a corporate more recently, is expanding our product lines quite a lot. So initially, from being a mobile networking player. Now we have silicon which goes into mobile species, XRS, wearables. We also have a cloud inferencing platform, and most of these platforms have npus inbuilt so they can run AI workloads on device. I also feel some of this solution could, or at least a part of this workload could run on edge, and that could bring a lot of say, privacy and cost benefits to solutions. We're exploring partnerships with a lot of companies in that space, sort of seeing if we can package the software plus hardware solution together and bring some of these companies to market through our business development teams and things like that. So there's a long term partnership proposition that we would like to explore as well, but that's that's one of the strategic value adds that we can bring as well good and just a brief about me. We I'm a senior associate here in the team, been with the Fund for about two years. Prior to that, I was I spent some time at Menlo Ventures in the bay and some time with Morpheus ventures in LA. The fund itself has been around Memphis ventures, Menlo and Morpheus. Oh, Marcus, yeah. So the fund itself has been around for 25 years. This was our 25th year anniversary. Deployed more than $2 billion in capital, and have 250 plus active portfolio companies today. So global fund across all different regions. We have an office in Europe as well, and check sizes we range from two to $15 million so we are very stage agnostic. We have done seed checks. We have done pre IPO rounds as well, and then AI being a very primary focus area for us, given the platform shift that we have seen. But but we apart from that, we invest in a lot of other areas, robotics, data center, industrial automation and automotive tech stack and a lot of those areas as well.
Got it, got it. So most of our team, I assume, is operating remotely for now, yeah, that's right, got it. And how big is the team? Avi, it's six of us. Okay, okay, got it.

S Speaker 25:06So excellent, so I'm familiar. Can I assume that Qualcomm has a similar mandate to some of the other industrial VCs where you'll want to use the product, or get the product contracted in one of your business groups, first use it successfully for a few months, and then, and then

S Speaker 15:30invest that's a great question. Avi, and actually, no, so that's that's a interesting part from for why I like my job is that we don't really need to have a strategic contract with Qualcomm, to make an investment, we operate very much as a financial VC would, however we do leverage, say, Qualcomm's engineering, GTM partnerships, opportunities to add strategic value. And that's not necessarily a given to make an investment.

S Speaker 16:02Oh yeah, 100% we definitely would like to explore a lot of those spaces. And I know my marketing team, I haven't had a recent chat, but our marketing team is one of the more, I would say, forward looking teams in the in the entire business units. They do adopt a lot of AI solutions, and Snapdragon as a brand is, and we have a new brand called Dragon bring a dragon wing. So those brands we really want to publicize quite a lot. So could be, could be opportunities there.

S Speaker 26:34But like we, you know, we're kind of this research lab, right? And we've been researching if synthetic agents can be used to replicate causal studies. Yeah, you know, really kind of like gold standard, market research, conjoints, discrete choice, willingness to pay GABA Granger all of those studies. And we think we've cracked it, and now we're at the point where we're rolling out our first commercial product, and we would like that first commercial product to be an AI product manager, say, you know, a 5pm or an AI product creator. And, you know, for companies that are innovating in the consumer space rapidly. That's kind of the perfect fit for us.

S Speaker 17:26Yeah, that's that's super interesting, or we 100% agree with the thesis and vision here. I'd love to understand a little bit more on when you say you have cracked synthetic humans. What? What benchmarks are you using internally? How do you have what? What enables you to make that claim essentially, yeah, no, that's the right question. Let me pull

S Speaker 28:02look at our website, we really only, you know, I come from Wall Street finance, unless something is investment grade, unless something is reliable and repeatable and it has error bars, it's not it's not research. Most market research is not research. Yeah, and like, you know, you have all these synthetic focus groups, these synthetic, you know, companies that are like, Oh, we're using AI to like, scale focus groups, or scale one on one interviews, or scale surveys. And I'm just thinking that is the least like, reliable, reproducible part of market research, like you're using AI to scale the worst part of market research, we're doing the exact opposite. We're starting with the hardest possible problem, which is causal human behavior, and because we're the only people measuring our results against the world's economics, sociology and psychology research, which I'll show you how we do it. We're the only ones who can make a claim that we are X or Y percent from human like, I see all these people like, oh, like, we can predict which LinkedIn, you know, post is going to be more popular with 95% accuracy. It's like a language model can do that. Yeah. All right, so you asked the question, how do we measure we
look at our website, we really only, you know, I come from Wall Street finance, unless something is investment grade, unless something is reliable and repeatable and it has error bars, it's not it's not research.

S Speaker 29:31studies, randomized, controlled, blinded studies that have an AMC, or sometimes it's called a Kate, sometimes it's called an at but it's effectively an average, marginal conditional effect. It's a causal claim. It tells you what causes an individual to take an action. And so this is a sample replication study. We work with Dr Howard Moskowitz at Harvard University. We've replicated 1200 studies there. We work with Dr Christine obituary at UPenn. We've replicated about 350 studies there. We worked with Dr Richard Taylor at the University of Chicago. We replicated about 80 studies there. By the way, University of Chicago also invested in us, okay,

S Speaker 210:15So we use the world research and private research as the benchmark causal research. So I'll give you an example of what replication study looks like. This is Hayne Mueller 2014 I think, yeah, Hayne Mueller 2014 and this is an immigration study. So the question is, who would you prefer to immigrate into the United States? And so this yellow, these yellow dots, is Hayne Mueller. That is, humans, excuse me. And then these are just some older language models that we use to benchmark right and so women are preferred to men

S Speaker 210:51the more educated you are, the more likely we are to approve you. The better you speak English, the more the better we are, the better likely that you are to be approved. We don't care where you're from, with the one exception being Iraq, right? You know, Americans in 2014 had a negative Iraqi bias. And now it's interesting is, if you look at the language models, Mistral had a strong positive bias towards Iraqi immigrants. And so Mistral, you know, is the French model as an example. So, so you can start to see not only how the bias of the models is similar or dissimilar from humans, but how the models would have a bias within models is different or similar, yeah. And you know, when we when we say how similar we are, what we do is we rank the amcds of a causal experiment, and then we see how well does our ranking match someone else's ranking? And that's our measurement

S Speaker 212:38So we had, we have a SpaceX study where customers use it in different ways, typically with hard to find audiences, is the main, is the main use case, right? So if you have, like a luxury buyer, you have, you know, SpaceX had a centi millionaire buyer, there's only so many centi millionaires you can survey, yeah, and so we can simulate them, and we can tell you what causes a sentiment or to take an action. And so when we did the study, they were building a human spaceflight product,

S Speaker 213:25people don't want to spend six weeks in space. They want to spend a day in space, two days in space, and they want to be able to tell their friends that they were trained to the same level of an astronaut. And so,

S Speaker 113:43that's pretty interesting. Avisual, if I were to break that down, what's interesting to me, personally, and I've spoken to a few companies in this space, it seems like you are more focused on, say, not just predicting the outcome, but also predicting the causality behind it.

S Speaker 214:02We only focus on causality. That's why. That's why it's men versus boys. Like everyone else is predicting what a language model will say, Yeah, or what it's human will say, and that is reliably unreliable. And I'm like Steve Jobs famously did not trust market research. He said, If I asked people what they wanted, they'd say a phone booth on every corner. You know, Henry and Ford asked our horses. You asked most men What kind of coffee they like this. I love a dark, robust blend. But when you run the experiment and you look at the action, not the word love, light and sweet. It's the insight behind Starbucks. So you know, if you want marketing to work, you need to not just know what people are going to say, but also what they're going to do. And marketing works in the gap.

Specifically, how do you perform transfer learning across conjoint experiments, which is something that's previously been impossible. We think we figured that out, yeah, there's, we have some patents on simulating latent traits, which are what is truly causal. 2000 Nobel Prize winning paper, if I read about it in economics. And then we have partnerships with a couple of data vendors. That's kind of the easy part. You have about access to about two 50 million individuals, and we have about 100,000 data points per individuals, per individual, and that's partnerships with, you know, you go and Crux and watt data and a couple of other guys, but the data is the easy part,

S Speaker 217:53That's what we're trying to really nail down. Like now that we built the platform, we launched a product about a month ago for market researchers, we have an API will be sell for $5,000 a month. We also have, like, a UI where a market researcher can, like, design, run and analyze their own data for $1,000 a month in about a month. We're coming out with our first product, product which is going to be like an AI Products Manager, yeah. So you kind of load up your personas, you load up your products, and then we just fill everything else out. We fill out your competing products, we fill out the user journey, fill out the you know, we run experiments at every part of the journey, and then we can actually advise a PM, what initiatives will provide what value and what the effort is, and you can, you know, plot them on a nice little graph.

S Speaker 118:46Obviously, let's, let's sort of discuss a little bit more about the AI product manager that's certainly very interesting. What kind of data sources would it ingest, or, let's say, out of the box, what level of accuracy do you hope to reach, and how big a Delta the accuracy would be when you sort of ingest, say, product logs, customer logs, analytics, all of those. It's a good question, and I understand it would vary, use case by use case, product by product, demographic by demographic, but roughly ballpark. Where do you think it will fit?

19:32but I will say that
S Speaker 219:36a high quality my feeling, and I'm talking my book here a little bit, but a high quality simulation where, where everything in the simulation is grounded. You know, the personas, the individuals that are that you're experimenting on are based on real individuals. The products that you're experimenting on are real products. They're competing products in the aisle. It's an accurate version of like a Best Buy shopping aisle, right? Not visually, but conceptually. As long as you're grounding everything you know, time, location, individual product prices, and it's all based on real data, I think the accuracy can be quite high without you know, customer Purchase Logs, for example, yeah,

S Speaker 220:29at least, yeah. Out of the box, we're getting like 93% accuracy on most research. Yeah, sometimes it's like, sometimes it's indistinguishable from human. And the times when it's not, the times when our correlations are negative. For example, we've discovered that there was fraud in the initial paper. So we've, we've discovered a fraud detector.

S Speaker 121:32how does Avi in your I'm sure you've spent a lot of time in this, in your understanding. How does this compare with some of the competitors you see out there, there's artificial societies, there is UX AI, there's a new YC company, Santam, some of them are there's also alembic, if I'm not wrong, Qualcomm has had some interactions with alembic as well.

S Speaker 223:31Oh, this is cool. I'm totally building this this weekend. So I would say, I would say, No, nobody I know does causal AI, with the exception of alembic, you know, the Olympic guys, they're probably the closest analogy, yeah, um, nobody does true RCTs. Everyone does like, you know, descriptive studies. Nobody is simulating actions. Everyone's simulating an opinion. Oh, look at this website. Give me a scale of one to seven. No, that's not It's not predictable. That's not reliable. And so I would say our differentiators are like no one's benchmarking against real humans and real research, as far as I know. But yeah, I would say alembic is probably the closest competitor. I would say statsig is another one. Like that's kind of what we try to do, right? We don't just try to say which feature will be predicted. We try to say which users are influenceable. We try to say which features are prioritized, and how much will people pay for each feature and why? Yeah, and I would say the other thing we're doing that no one else is doing, is, you know, is simulating the latent variables, the hidden variables. People are making synthetics based on demographics. Nobody takes actions because of their age, income, race, gender. They take action because of their motivations, their effects, their attitudes, their behaviors. And so we simulate those, those hidden traits also.

S Speaker 127:23We would do one company in one space. We wouldn't invest in competitors. No. So that's why it essentially, if we do invest in a space, we do a very broad sort of market mapping. We try to meet at least 70% of the companies in that space, and really see if we can have very detailed understanding of the space. So just starting my research here, we have met a few companies. I met Sanctum feature early, like I mentioned, would like to speak to a few more, but essentially sort of understand the entire market, end to end. Alembic would be in my radar as well pretty soon, and I know Qualcomm has had a few interactions with them. And essentially, if we are going ahead with a POC or a contract in this phase, I'd love to come back to you as well and see if you can do a competitive big off something

S Speaker 129:59got and Avi. So do you think some of the contracts that you would take in, especially are, say, mid market and enterprise customers?
