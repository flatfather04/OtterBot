S Speaker 30:23Yeah, no worries. I do have our Chief of Staff, priyhard, joining but I think he's running a few minutes late. Okay, Would you guys mind if we record? Or do you guys want to do no forwarding? It's I'm fine with either or I just have to take notes. If that's case, what's your preference

S Speaker 21:17So you know about Qualcomm ventures and have some background. Okay, fantastic, fantastic. Yeah, we started to cover this space over the last year and a half because Qualcomm is getting into the business of data centers. We also announced an acquisition of alpha waves. So we have three products. We have a server CPU product, which is based on Nubia. We have an accelerator product, and then we'll have a bunch of portfolio certies and custom.

S Speaker 31:44Oh, I'm so sorry. Yes, with this table being used, Oh, totally in chat, I'll move around. Is there a place where I can take a video upon not bother anyone? Totally understand. Sorry about that, Varsha, I know you were going through the middle. Let me just relocate and I'll be right back.

S Speaker 32:57So thank you so much for your time. I understand from what Priyesh told me, your data centers me you can around the block with different products. So the data centers and that aspect, I'm happy to tell you about my vision and why we started, as you suggested, as well, too, just so I know how did

S Speaker 28:44I think the problem statement is real, so I think that that's we have no questions about that. I think we want to understand the approach. So we are familiar with Fidra, familiar with emerald, familiar with some of the companies that you mentioned. So would like to understand your if we can look through the demo as before as well. But it'll be maybe good to understand where do you enter into the data center, sort of go through the approach and congratulations on the five prints that you've had. Those are, those are huge. So it'll be good to just go through the deployment case study of one of these guys as well.

S Speaker 39:28How are you guys looking at the marketing? I mean, are you guys looking at deploying into one of these companies actively? I guess formula, one of these companies actively, how you guys feeling? Because you could easily ask for a demo, and I could show you that. But what is the value here to us? You know,

S Speaker 29:45absolutely so for us, Qualcomm sells into the data center market. So like I mentioned, with three of our products, so we would be looking at potential partnerships here with companies, and these partnerships could be two ways. One is potentially for our on prem stuff, and then as go to market partnerships as to where we sell. And the third is, depending on how you do it. We also have a large IoT group, and that's why, when I said, it would be good to understand how you work, because then we can figure out which business unit might be a good partners.

12:35up some information.
S Speaker 213:04Is it possible for you to maximize one second? I'm not familiar with the Google meet option, just one second. So I'm not able to see this in full screen mode, just one second. Okay, go ahead.

S Speaker 313:24Yeah, so we're a data center autopilot solution. We're an on premise solution. Do you understand why we build on PrEP?
Yeah, so we're a data center autopilot solution. We're an on premise solution. Do you understand why we build on PrEP?

S Speaker 213:42I feel real time sensor data is very important. That's what we learned from our IoT practice. I don't know if that's what you see or some other 100%

S Speaker 313:53because the polling rates from a generator could be 40 seconds through a gateway, the polling rates from an HVAC unit on a baud rate of 9600 could be two minutes. And if I pull too much data from different bowling rates, the system goes down. That's right on the cloud. You have a five minute interval. I'm so glad you brought this up. We're allowing this. So let me walk us through why we build it on prem and the deployment. So the three big problems that we solve for our customers today, Martha, Is this inside their center. When it comes to their mechanical systems, they have multiple systems, HVAC, lighting gateways, control mechanisms that are fragmented multiple different systems. These systems because they don't have a way to communicate all you can build a BMS, but it takes a lot of manual integrations to put it all into one place. Because of that, your awareness on your system is very low. So what do you do? You run your systems at 100% so a good example of this is your HVAC systems. They're built on internal sensors that run by themselves. So because of that, your site is underutilized. Every electromechanical system has waste.

S Speaker 215:04Every company already deploys a BMS system, and so perfect. If they have deployed one, I assume you'd work with them.

S Speaker 315:15Perfect. So if we deploy a BMS system, or are you telling me to speed it up to get to the point of how we're different from BMS.
Perfect. So if we deploy a BMS system, or are you telling me to speed it up to get to the point of how we're different from BMS.

S Speaker 215:21I'm just, you know, no, I think you will get there. I was just wondering, as you go through this deployment cycle, since most of these companies, we have seen BMS deployment to be quite wide among these centers. Let us know if you see it otherwise in your actual customer deployments. So if those are already deployed with your solution, sit on top. Get that, plus any other GPU CPU data that you may collect.

15:55Why do you mention GPU CPU data?
Why do you mention GPU CPU data?
Why do you mention GPU CPU data?

S Speaker 215:57Because now you see the power is so high and hungry those are they take so much power,

Because now you see the power is so high and hungry those are they take so much power,
Because now you see the power is so high and hungry those are they take so much power,
S Speaker 316:05yeah, so we sit on top of the BMS system, and we do grab CP data, which figure everyone else.
yeah, so we sit on top of the BMS system, and we do grab CP data, which figure everyone else.

16:17So we is that everyone?
So we is that everyone?
So we is that everyone?
So we is that everyone?
S Speaker 216:19So I don't think I got the complete picture as to how you you are an on premise system. You collect data from all the sensors in the wherever there is a data available. Is that right? That's right, yeah. Okay. And what is the, let's say, you know, in your deployments. If some of these things do not have sensors, do not have data, do you also build something there? Or you really deploy depend on systems having ability to integrate into your overall system?
So I don't think I got the complete picture as to how you you are an on premise system. You collect data from all the sensors in the wherever there is a data available. Is that right?

S Speaker 316:54Well, yeah, we don't deploy sensors. And as you know, because of certain guidelines or publication, you can sell polo space if you don't have certain monitors. Yeah,

S Speaker 317:12Well, things are great. I mean, reinforcement learning was created by beta and the whole team, right? So that's great. What do you want to know? Do we use reinforcement learning? Do we use liquid neural networks? Why does why are they going after merge? Why are we not what is this specific team?

S Speaker 317:42So yeah, they'll, they'll win. Their model is distance. Our model is really about speed and trust. And we deploy on prem. We want to build trust with the facility manager. So we use multiple different models to be able to do that deep learning. You know, I can go deeper as we go in deeper. But I think everyone that does data centers does it wrong. We have to predict the environmental data right, h1, 100, we can reach thermal throttling in eight seconds, by the time a crack unit gets a return temperature sensor, or a liquid cooled rat gets an inlet or outlet temperature is too long. So you have to predict load on the CPU, GPU side. You still have these metrics, like PVC, we others. So what we do is we feed the model more data center specific data. As you know, it's very hard to transfer from ot to IP to good CPU GPU, you guys will semiconducting people. So, you know, it's very different. We provide. We applied for a provisional pattern on how we do that. We can grab that data without affecting the customers that we can do it on most systems. As new systems come up, it's going to be very difficult, but our whole claim as a company, if I were to summarize it for you, we can get in on prem inside a data center task, all cybersecurity checks, pick up all the system in a matter of two months and show ROI and save them energy in a matter of six months. In a matter of 12 months, the software not only pays for itself, but they can alleviate energy waste, where they can pack in more compute and get revenue back on the products. That's kind of our model.

S Speaker 319:49Yeah, so it's really about when can the model use free cooling so on crack pain compressor, it's usually about 40% reduction in HVAC energy, right? That's really you have to get the model to understand when it can use frequent if the model can understand when CPU, GPU load is available, you're probably asking, How do you know that in the AI data center, where everything's volatile, that's where the chili plant comes in, or a liquid fluid plane comes in. So it's very dependent Varsa. But it's really about getting the model to understand safety constraints to you frequent,

S Speaker 320:31wow. It's really about trucks at the end of the day, when you talk these we're in the middle of Tennessee right now. Next week, I'm going to Nebraska. We know how to talk to these guys, right? It's really about getting in there and making them understand that we're only here for you, right? So I was funny. I was sitting on a call with hyperview, my client in Tennessee, allowed me, as a vendor, to sit on a call with hyperview, which is a decent platform, and I just sat there like, Oh, my God, wait. They were trying to feature yourself. Oh, you can see the rag like Nvidia Omniverse. You can see each rack. You see the heat coming off this rack. And I was like, Look, dude, no one cares about all that. Everyone cares about safety and being able to allow to see. What can I do without minimizing with my minimizing risk, get the most value out. So I'll give you an example. One of our clients is a health system data center, right? They don't sell that from 2000 what we do every single time. Let's say we save them $600,000 on the data center. And you know what they're going to use that for, to buy more hospital beds, MRI machines, like I got so deep with the facility team to be able to get that. I know that's more of a soft thing, but it's about that.
wow. It's really about trucks at the end of the day, when you talk these we're in the middle of Tennessee right now. Next week, I'm going to Nebraska. We know how to talk to these guys, right?

S Speaker 221:41Yeah, that's important. And are you competing, typically for these contracts? Who do you see as your competition? The five wins that you've had so far?

S Speaker 321:53Yeah? I mean, like on the decent and monitoring, like there's so many competition, but we don't monitor, right? The value is actually autonomous control, right? Not everyone can claim autonomous control, right? So for monitoring, there's a lot, right? There's sunbird, there's a hyper view, there's so like 40 different vendors, we try to cut through all that. We try to say, Hey, this is autonomous control. This is real time control. This is so but when you get your autonomous real time control, maybe Johnson Controls open blue I think maybe Schneider has an AI team working on deep learning controls. But, you know, the market's so big, I might, I might catch Phaedra every 300 data centers. I've talked about my catch up once, and they've raised a lot of money, so they probably have a lot of pressure on on making revenue. I don't, right. I have a lot of pressure right now in telling people I don't even want to get in business with people. I just want to really understand my customer. But by taking it that way, I'm landing, you know, huge customers like CBA and dominion, right? Because I don't have that post right now. So I really want to get this right.

S Speaker 224:52So samsara is our partner, customer and partner, and we, you know, because the customer needs a complete solution. And so in many cases, it's a partnership solution. That's why, when I was asking you how your product is designed, how it is deployed, that was trying to figure out, are there opportunities to partner with our IoT team,

S Speaker 325:15that's cool. We're big sandwich. I'm sorry, some of the work they've done, and just so I understand. I mean, there's so many different types of acquisitions happening right now, right Johnson bought Foghorn, the sensor meshing system. And then later on, you know, obviously, since our was the IPO, then there was lorwan, and then these, this patent that was big in the IoT industry, which is sensors that basically power themselves on vibration. You can put it on a compressor, and they will power themselves. You require themselves. I forget which company has that.

You can put it on a compressor, and they will power themselves. You require themselves. I forget which company has that.
that's cool. We're big sandwich. I'm sorry, some of the work they've done, and just so I understand.

S Speaker 225:46Yeah, you know, there's a whole bunch. There's a very, very broad industry

S Speaker 325:51that's amazing, so interesting enough. The way we work is we want to make sure, when it comes to data center, I don't want to be bogged down to one IoT solution. I can't be as a facility team and manager, because it initiates risk. So I cheer point. Obviously, there's some systems I have to be one, like Schneider owns my power panels, and now usually my gateways will be A, B and B, so I have to go to those guys, but I can't get bogged down with one type of platform. So we had to build agnostic leads. Now, as you know, some most of the trusted platforms in the facility management space were built before tritium and Niagara in the 1990s that's, that's what was trusted, because that was on Modbus and back then, all the different systems. So I it's part where I see, like more homogeneous sensors, like a nuclear power plant. I got the visit 120 1000 sensors, and they're all usually one vendor that go to the control room. Do you guys go after missions or like

S Speaker 226:46that? We go after the whole market. Abhishek. So it's a because IoT is a very broad portfolio. So they are all, all of them are of interest to us. Why don't we do this? Let us think through which if any of those partnerships may be of interest to you, as well as to our business unit, and then circle back on next steps. Let's do it that way. And you're in the Bay Area, so

S Speaker 227:16interested in a partnership with IoT, so we need to circle back with them on potential ways to collaborate with you, I think is yours is 100% software solution. There is no hardware element to it. So, and I understand you want to be agnostic with the IoT portfolio, that makes a lot of sense. So if we sell directly into the data center. Then there is great opportunity with the IoT team, because then you you'll have opportunity to partner with them on the Data Center team. It will be again partnership to to be selling to the hyperscalers, etc. There we would be selling the hardware portfolio. So it will be sort of common customer interest on the data center side. That's the way I see it makes sense. Thanks for Thanks for taking the time appreciate it, and congratulations on the success. If there is an opportunity here, then we'll circle back and then go forward with a follow up call when you get that the Bay Area
