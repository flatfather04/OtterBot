did you learn about us? So,
S Speaker 20:41yes, yes, yes, yes. I was part of the sosv climate tech conference, and apparently they send out a very specific fit of startups to us. So fluids was one of them. And interestingly, we have been looking at the data center space quite a lot. There are a few members on the team who have been more focused in that area. Me, personally, we, or I can give you a brief introduction about the Qualcomm ventures as well. But personally, I'm trying to expand our firm's focus on electrification and energy efficiency is a space we are very actively looking at, and that's where I feel fluids would be a good fit. Specifically, given all the HPC load is increasing energy demanding substantially. So that's an area we want to sort of be more educated about and make a few investments. So that's why I wanted to take the time today. And thanks a lot for taking the time. I understand we had to move it around a couple of times, so I appreciate that. Maybe I can start with an introduction about the firm, brief about myself, and then we'll pass it over to you to know about flux. A little bit more in your own words. So I am currently a Senior Associate here at Qualcomm ventures. I lead our AI and electrification investments. The firm itself has been around for about 26 years now we are the corporate venture arm of Qualcomm. So that means the entire LP base for our fund is Qualcomm. We have just Qualcomm as a sole LP base. While it's a corporate venture arm, we act quite financially independent. So our decisions are ours. It does not need to have a very strategic angle. In that sense, we invest in a lot of areas. AI is a very prominent area nowadays, given that we have a very strong hardware stack, and we want to invest downstream from there. So you'd see some interesting AI investments in our portfolio, about hugging face, anthropic scale, AI weights and biases. So we have made a bunch of those infrastructure investments, I'd say, and we're looking for more AI applications to bet on, other than AI, we have invested in a lot of IoT hardware plus software companies. We have invested quite a lot in automobile tech stack XR robotics companies. So things, I would say, which fit well within Qualcomm focus of compute and connectivity are areas which are interesting to us, particularly for flux. We are trying to look into electrification as a focus area. So grid efficiency, Home Energy Management, energy management and data centers are some focus areas that we want to evaluate. And hence, I feel fluids would be affected and a couple of things on a check sizes very quickly we invest. We plan to invest somewhere around one $50 million a year in the US ecosystem. So we're actively deploying capital check sizes are two to 10 million we are, preferably a Series A investor, but we do see it opportunistically as well, and that's more more or less about it. Did I miss anything? Is there anything specific that you would like to

Did I miss anything? Is there anything specific that you would like to
S Speaker 13:46know? No, that fits as well. And how deeply have you guys been looking at data center? What the What interests you the most on data center?
know? No, that fits as well. And how deeply have you guys been looking at data center? What the What interests you the most on data center?

S Speaker 23:54So yeah, we have a partner focusing on data center. I think the focus area today is on interconnections between data centers, where she is looking at multiple different technologies and trying to see if there is a space there not. I haven't looked into that space personally, quite a lot. I think I'm approaching it more from a focus area that whether this could be an energy efficiency play, and we have invested in span, io, if you are aware of them. So they are a player in home energy efficiency. That's been a successful investment for us in that space. So we want to expand more on that space. Yeah,

S Speaker 14:31I understand Priyesh And usually CBC take a long time, right? They usually take what you have to loop and partner. Obviously this call has to go well, then you have to loop in interest, due diligence, data room. By that time, we would have already changed, right? So I'm going to be quite candid. Obviously, I know this is an intro call, and we're trying to get to know each other, but we're about to close around this week, and this is our safe round, and I'm sure we're going to get an opportunity to meet each other again through conferences and obviously, and you guys are obviously the biggest players in the space. So why don't we meet up in a few months from now? Why don't we have an introductory call there?

S Speaker 25:12Sure. I mean, yeah, I think that makes it that sounds well. In fact, the one week timeline wouldn't really work for us. You're right in pointing out it takes about, let's say, a month, month and a half, for us to go through our entire due diligence pipeline loop and some people from compliance and get everything put together. So yeah, that that could be a better time. Would you like to just meet? Are you based on the Bay Area?
Sure. I mean, yeah, I think that makes it that sounds well. In fact, the one week timeline wouldn't really work for us.

S Speaker 25:42well, too, right? Yes, our office is in Santa Clara, but most of the ventures team is based out of the bay area, so we're around the San Mateo, San Carlos area. But yeah, absolutely. The next time we chat, we can possibly make it in person.

S Speaker 16:18mean, I'd love to build a relationship with you guys. I it's q2 would be great, because by then, you know, we would have, de risked, had the opportunity to earn a call with you guys. You know, we're fairly released, so I think that would make sense. I'll leave it up to you. Priyesh, if q2 sounds good, we

S Speaker 26:36can send some time that sounds good. Abhi, absolutely. Meanwhile, keep me updated on the progress that the team goes through. I think I have your deck already, so that's a good starting point. I have an understanding of what you guys are trying to build, and as we educate ourselves in this area, more further, if we have any questions, I'd appreciate the time to send it across to you, just get some of your views as well.
