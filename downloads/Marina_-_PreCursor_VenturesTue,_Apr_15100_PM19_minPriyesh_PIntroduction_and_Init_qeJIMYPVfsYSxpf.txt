S Speaker 10:39absolutely. Yeah, they were an interesting company, for sure. I'm trying to be close with the company. Possibly we will be able to come in next round, if they're doing good. But it was a stage early for us where we like to invest in but very interesting company. I am quite excited about the next version of the product that they're building right now. Yeah,

S Speaker 21:00yeah. Very cool. Awesome. Well, it's great to meet you. So excited to hear more about you and what you're focused on at Qualcomm. I used to research some encounter companies, so Qualcomm was one of them. Obviously very different than Qualcomm ventures, but still some like small connection. Are you

S Speaker 25:35I feel like Nvidia has been so active in the amount of AI companies. Do you guys feel like you're competitive with them, just like, not Qualcomm video, but like the venture funds? Do you feel like you're trying to get into those deals too? Or we

S Speaker 15:50do see that. So a lot of times Nvidia comes in very early. I also seeing their Nvidia Inception program, or Nvidia for starters. I don't know what they exactly call it, but that program is very wide focus. So they have a lot of companies already, and I'm sure with the GPU resources they have, it's a great proposition for early stage companies who partner with them. Late stages, we have made co investments with Nvidia, so we don't see them as our competitors. But at times, it does happen that there is probably round for one strategic in this highly competitive series, a round, and then if Nvidia is also in play, we might just get pushed out, unless it's a very edge compute focused company, where Qualcomm probably have has a better play. Got it

9:51but a lot more fun.
S Speaker 29:55Yeah, it's been going good. We're a team of five investors. Me and the GP are both check writers, so again, just like trying not to waste time, so we don't do voting, we don't do ICs. Again, I just need, usually, one call with the founder, and then I can give it a week or two and decide if I'd like to invest. Yeah, and that's it, yeah? Well, we're definitely generalist. Truthfully, though, I'm spending, I am spending less time with, like, AI applications, definitely, especially at Priyesh, seeing way too much AI agents and CO pilots. It's definitely a little bit exhausting. Yeah, so I'm taking a step back from that and thinking back of, like, where's true innovation. You know, when BC was originally created as an asset class, it was to invest in the craziest ideas. And I want to kind of go back to that. So looking at more tech that's not easily repeatable, whether that's like software companies building their own data sets, or whether that's, you know, deep tech, hard tech companies. So I'm currently diligent saying a deep tech company that's they're building a brand new sea plane, which obviously is not an easy thing for someone to do. So spending more time there. I mean, I'll still look at AI applications, but I think it has to be a truly exceptional founder and come well referred before doing so. But or I'll just have some also my team. Other people on my team are still open to AI apps, but I'm just being more diligent. That

S Speaker 111:23makes sense. It's a very exciting space you play in Marina. I remember a few years back when I was thinking about making a pivot into venture. This is what I would have exactly wanted to do, a lot of checks going as early as possible. Probably a follow up question, do you work closely with your founders, and the kind of volume you actually deal with the How does it like? How does it make it possible for you to really work so closely?

How does it make it possible for you to really work so closely?
S Speaker 211:47Yeah, so we, we do deal close with our founders. However, it's as close as they want us to be. So we have some founders that, you know, anytime we want to meet with anyone more than once a month. So we have some founders that meet once a month, some that want to meet once a quarter. We have some founders that never want to meet and just want to do emails. And that's okay too, but we let them dictate the cadence, but it's usually never more than once a month. And then outside of that, we usually they usually only want to talk to us pre Series A. Once they reach Series A, they just need less from us. They probably have a larger fund with a platform team on the cap table. They probably have boards now. They just need a lot less. So of the ones that are pre series A and still active, it's probably less than half of the 400 still. Yes, that is a lot, but it's much more manageable, and we're kind of like a well machine at this point. Yeah, I'm
Yeah, so we, we do deal close with our founders. However, it's as close as they want us to be. So we have some founders that, you know, anytime we want to meet with anyone more than once a month.

Yes, that is a lot, but it's much more manageable, and we're kind of like a well machine at this point. Yeah, I'm
S Speaker 112:48sure, I'm sure that that makes sense. And when you invest so do you back your found of winners, and to what extent do you back them? How big a check, a follow on check, can be for you?
sure, I'm sure that that makes sense. And when you invest so do you back your found of winners, and to what extent do you back them? How big a check, a follow on check, can be for you?
sure, I'm sure that that makes sense. And when you invest so do you back your found of winners, and to what extent do you back them? How big a check, a follow on check, can be for you?
sure, I'm sure that that makes sense. And when you invest so do you back your found of winners, and to what extent do you back them? How big a check, a follow on check, can be for you?
S Speaker 213:01Yeah, so we do. I'd say we probably back 20 to 40% of our companies that we first checked in. Follow on checks can go as high as 1 million on average, though I'd say probably is still around that 500k mark, but it can go higher. And yeah, so we typically do invest, and we can invest in all the rounds before they reach the Series A, and we do series A as well. Sometimes, rarely do we go up beyond Series A, but we have sometimes if we get allocation, but usually option, including the Series A, so pre seed to Series A, two rounds. It's more like four or five, and we could do all those,
Yeah, so we do. I'd say we probably back 20 to 40% of our companies that we first checked in. Follow on checks can go as high as 1 million on average, though I'd say probably is still around that 500k mark, but it can go higher.

It's more like four or five, and we could do all those,
S Speaker 113:46right? And you, you typically try to preserve your ownership through pro rata. Is that how you go about
right? And you, you typically try to preserve your ownership through pro rata. Is that how you go about
right? And you, you typically try to preserve your ownership through pro rata. Is that how you go about
right? And you, you typically try to preserve your ownership through pro rata. Is that how you go about
S Speaker 213:52it? Yeah, we can, um, even, of course, trying to do more than pro rata, especially if, you know, we just come in with a 50k check for the first round and slightly larger round. Hopefully we provide enough value and they like us enough that we go slightly larger than pro rata. But as long as we get minimum pro rata, the companies that we really like, that's
it? Yeah, we can, um, even, of course, trying to do more than pro rata, especially if, you know, we just come in with a 50k check for the first round and slightly larger round. Hopefully we provide enough value and they like us enough that we go slightly larger than pro rata. But as long as we get minimum pro rata, the companies that we really like, that's

S Speaker 114:13what's important. Makes sense. Makes sense. So what spaces are currently very exciting to you. Where are you spending your most time in Yeah, I mean,
what's important. Makes sense. Makes sense. So what spaces are currently very exciting to you. Where are you spending your most time in Yeah, I mean,
what's important. Makes sense. Makes sense. So what spaces are currently very exciting to you. Where are you spending your most time in Yeah, I mean,
what's important. Makes sense. Makes sense. So what spaces are currently very exciting to you. Where are you spending your most time in Yeah, I mean,
S Speaker 217:01feel free to, just want to check that it's not competitive with my company. That's really the only thing. But I'm happy to take a look at the deck. This is great also, because you are talking to a lot of companies that are too early for you. So if you ever meet one you like, but it's too early. Just send it on down, because nothing is too early for us. And same here, I mean, you do series A plus like, that's amazing. So we always have 60 to 70 companies fundraising. So I can let you know any that I think might be a good fit. And I'll also add you into our we have a quarterly email that goes out to investors and it just says, because we do 50 deals a year, this is the deals we did this quarter, in case you get those, and, you know, track them. But also our entire air table portfolio is there, and you can click on it, and just like, filter by deep tech, filter by AI, and filter by Series A, Series B, whatever you want. So I'll add you to that list too. Absolutely,
