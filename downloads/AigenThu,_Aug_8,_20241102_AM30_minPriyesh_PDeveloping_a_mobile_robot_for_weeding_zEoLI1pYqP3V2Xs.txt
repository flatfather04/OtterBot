S Speaker 10:02guess a monthly charge for the website hosting. Yeah. On my current account that I lost, it just kept failing and then it was going to my junk junk mail on that. It was declining. So there was partially my fault. I was like, Guys, it's this should not be on my credit card. Yeah.

S Speaker 21:06wanted to just get an update so I can tell you I mean, we've been looking at a few ag tech robots companies again, and that's how, you know,

S Speaker 31:21I'm up to speed on why the need for weeding robots. I still had the three points that you have given me. You know, one of them was of course carbon emissions. The other one is of course, you can increase yields and there was a third of course, no pesticides. So tailing is not an option because of carbon emissions. So I had those in my notes from and I read the challenge. And I'm guessing those pills hold true and wanted to get an update on where you are.

S Speaker 12:00Yeah, yeah. Well, here's the long and short of it is. And let me pitch the talk about the company not as a weeding solution. But a technology platform that is happens to focus on weeding as our first kind of beachhead. So think about that. When you think about Earth observation technologies. off the bottom, we have satellites in space, and we know that the logos are satellite companies, you know, maybe SpaceX comes to mind north of revenue, etc. And then you have drones in the air. So So thinking about how, you know farmers are getting pissed off or landowners and because because DJI is being banned in the United States alternative, but you know, that's that's drones are very useful and then we have sensors in the ground. And it's commoditize, right, everybody makes sensors, cameras. Let's fix into this tech stack. What I believe it's really missing is a mobile round piece and that's continuously roaming. And self powered. So you can deploy it anywhere on the planet. And I think the important part here is self powered and roaming. I think that is the the key unlock, and of course, autonomy. And so if you were to think about who's working on this problem for land use, I can't I don't think anybody's really working on it in insert in any almost seriousness. But we've essentially built that we've built that platform. We built 50 of these for this growing season. And we've deployed it in, you know, rural America. I think it's also important to note that 40% of land use is agriculture. And that's why we're starting in agriculture. Because if we really want to be serious about making any impact on the planet, you gotta go where the the broad acres are, right? And then why the Midwest? That's another question that we get often. 1% of acres are organic. Most of it is conventional. So we're starting with conventional crops, then not the organic crops because the acres are just too small. All of the martyrs our margins are higher and organic. You know, the truth of the matter is, you know, the acreage is super low. Like for example, let's take for example, strawberries, right? There's a very high value crops. But if you if you compare strawberries to soybeans, it's miniscule in terms of acreage, of how much it's actually being fun. So with all that being said, we've built 50 of these robots deployed into the Midwest. We've hardened the vehicle. We've harmed part of the vehicle tremendously. And it's initially we set out to have a goal of three robots per one. human operator, we hit the goal of 10. robots to one human operator and let's go to 40 to one is what we're expecting to do, controlling audible.

S Speaker 15:51they were on the field. Okay, next year, they're going to be multiple driving around in a band, so not on the field. Okay. And then after that we were planning on for only going to the farmers. What is it mobile, they're hanging out in a band, but they're like managing multiple skills, not necessarily on the farm. Right.

S Speaker 26:25There's still so the robot right now is still waiting robot, right?
There's still so the robot right now is still waiting robot, right?
There's still so the robot right now is still waiting robot, right?
There's still so the robot right now is still waiting robot, right?
S Speaker 16:32Right, because we go talk to the farmers and say hey, let's solve your problem. So we can start deploying these robot robots at scale. So number one challenge we control. Specifically, the herbicide resistant weeds, where chemistry is not working anymore, right. It's a tremendous challenge. So

S Speaker 16:59Yeah, exactly. Our brand promises not that we're going to completely remove herbicides that for I mean, that's our secret mission, by the way, but that's not what we want to approach farmers. Yeah, we say hey, do what you always do. You have a residual problem. What are you doing about it? Well, if I had manual labor, I would hire manual labor to clean it up. But there's no manual labor in these parts. So they really view our robots as human labor as robotic manual labor, because it's how they view it.

S Speaker 17:54I don't think you would have I don't think you would have invested in laser robotics maybe? Because I heard they went with Qualcomm and video talking about

S Speaker 28:13I get it I mean, they might be using Nvidia processor is because it's easier initially, but but we actually do not we always look at that as an opportunity. Because the way we think about that as if you want to build prototypes, and initial units, then yes, or you can prove it out with Nvidia. But if you want to deploy especially anything edge hardware at scale, and then we know that we can come in and swap.

S Speaker 28:52big hurdle for us. But I think I'm just curious, which is, so I know that like carbon robotics is is laser.

S Speaker 19:01Number one, it's way too expensive for the technology for what it does. And then number two, it lasers only work when the weeds are really really small. Because essentially kind of laser just kind of fries them right and next slide down to the roots when the weed is actually really small. Once it gets isolated to a decent normal plant price, it does not work at all, or lasers will not have any impact on it. And and it goes too slow. So that's why the Midwest the big broadacres are not even looking at lasers. That's why they're not they're typically very right there and organic farms. specifically focus on like onions and carrots. I think is sort of our main focus. Organic application is great. And for for certain jobs for broadacres. That won't work.

S Speaker 210:10Okay. And what about John Deere? Like I remember John Deere had made some acquisitions in the space as well and

S Speaker 110:23So you're talking about seeing sprayer. So since sprays advantage is really primarily herbicide reduction. So just don't spray where it doesn't need to spray. That's that's, that's what their advantages. So you're going to reduce the cost of herbicides sprays. That's why the chemical companies and John Deere don't always get along, because the CM spray, that means that less, less herbicide costs, but where do you think the cost goes that the farmers are saving? Because there's John Deere right? That's how they do value extraction.

S Speaker 211:06So I got a tentative that I'm guessing that all these sales pitches Yeah,
So I got a tentative that I'm guessing that all these sales pitches Yeah,
So I got a tentative that I'm guessing that all these sales pitches Yeah,
So I got a tentative that I'm guessing that all these sales pitches Yeah,
S Speaker 111:10yeah, of course. And then we've seen it we actually done a demo next to the best in class of John Deere is ultimate seeds right. And their precision sprays are two by six feet, two by six feet. Bounding Box. That's right precision, when they call precision, it's a big box. And then that does not address herbicide resistant weeds. You're spraying herbicides still, so it doesn't roll
yeah, of course. And then we've seen it we actually done a demo next to the best in class of John Deere is ultimate seeds right. And their precision sprays are two by six feet, two by six feet.

S Speaker 111:42if I imagined the future will probably run run alongside precision spaces.

if I imagined the future will probably run run alongside precision spaces.
S Speaker 211:53Yeah, I guess. My guess is it's not going to be I mean, one solution to replace it all anytime in the near future. And why do farmers I'm curious, why do farmers what why are they not willing to get rid of pesticides right away?
Yeah, I guess. My guess is it's not going to be I mean, one solution to replace it all anytime in the near future. And why do farmers I'm curious, why do farmers what why are they not willing to get rid of pesticides right away?
Yeah, I guess. My guess is it's not going to be I mean, one solution to replace it all anytime in the near future. And why do farmers I'm curious, why do farmers what why are they not willing to get rid of pesticides right away?
Yeah, I guess. My guess is it's not going to be I mean, one solution to replace it all anytime in the near future. And why do farmers I'm curious, why do farmers what why are they not willing to get rid of pesticides right away?
S Speaker 112:15Okay, I know that answer. Because I before I started, started this company, I learned how to farm on my own and organic farming.
Okay, I know that answer. Because I before I started, started this company, I learned how to farm on my own and organic farming.

every day. I'm doing this with my hands. Like with the whole like, like doing this, like,
S Speaker 113:00I'm doing this. And like, I sort of got I was on an organic farm. If I had some chemical spray and if I was allowed to spray and they told me it will kill everything else except that carrot I probably would have done it. Right. And think about that, you know, I haven't like less than an acre. Imagine that over 1000 acres. Like it's just chemical is the ease scale. We don't work. I
I'm doing this. And like, I sort of got I was on an organic farm.

S Speaker 213:26agree and then now but if you offer them a solution, say that I have an alternative solution that works as good without the chemical sprays and it can scale. Then what lens like I'm guessing one they're skeptical. So they want this to be proven out. Like okay, I don't trust what you're saying. But but I'm gonna give it a shot on my entire field. But let's let's do trials. Is that

S Speaker 114:00Yeah, exactly. It's all about risk management. Like okay, like we'll see and then come and test it. Out. But I'm not gonna do like, first year I'm not gonna

S Speaker 214:08apology perspective. I'm curious. If is that technology still does it still need to get to a point where it's foolproof enough where it's as good as at least as good as the pesticides and if there were no pesticides being used?
apology perspective. I'm curious. If is that technology still does it still need to get to a point where it's foolproof enough where it's as good as at least as good as the pesticides and if there were no pesticides being used?

S Speaker 114:25Yeah, so the short answer is yes. Because we we need to tune the machine, mechanical and software to address certain density of weeds. Right. We went in asking, how dense is are is the expectation of herbicide resistant weeds? And the short answer to that is Nobody. Nobody.
Yeah, so the short answer is yes. Because we we need to tune the machine, mechanical and software to address certain density of weeds. Right. We went in asking, how dense is are is the expectation of herbicide resistant weeds? And the short answer to that is Nobody. Nobody.

S Speaker 114:55rottenness didn't know university professors that have better weed scientists didn't. Its weak, they only know that the problem is getting worse. They know that that's that's the answer. So what do we do? Well, let's go to collect data on a test bar and collect the number of weeks

that we see right? So we're like, holy shit, there's
that we see right? So we're like, holy shit, there's
S Speaker 115:25like okay, but we think we could do that by cutting weeds. Okay, well, we'll design a solution to that. And there'll be 1000s And then the farmers 1000s on my farms. Like, seriously, nobody knew. So we're redesigning our system to get on to the next year. So that's that's one and
like okay, but we think we could do that by cutting weeds. Okay, well, we'll design a solution to that. And there'll be 1000s And then the farmers 1000s on my farms. Like, seriously, nobody knew. So we're redesigning our system to get on to the next year. So that's that's one and

S Speaker 115:52this year was one of the wettest seasons of the scene the worst, but that's a great start first, yeah, we don't find this out what year so
this year was one of the wettest seasons of the scene the worst, but that's a great start first, yeah, we don't find this out what year so
this year was one of the wettest seasons of the scene the worst, but that's a great start first, yeah, we don't find this out what year so

S Speaker 116:07By the way this is going to if you've never been out there it sounds like okay, but are we thought to like we just like itself might know it is a whole thing. There's a book written about money. And all
By the way this is going to if you've never been out there it sounds like okay, but are we thought to like we just like itself might know it is a whole thing. There's a book written about money. And all

S Speaker 216:24you've got cameras and computer vision. Yeah, and I mean, you can build, you know, some form of self cleaning and all that. But when you're in mud in fields, especially when it's flashy, like how it was over the last year or so. Then, then you're going to have that camera covered with mud.
you've got cameras and computer vision. Yeah, and I mean, you can build, you know, some form of self cleaning and all that. But when you're in mud in fields, especially when it's flashy, like how it was over the last year or so. Then, then you're going to have that camera covered with mud.

S Speaker 116:54the arm being deployed like on the ground like this and you create the vector so actually calculates it here's the ground. You hit it this way. And it but the mud what happens is accumulates on the wheels. And then so what happens is it goes higher, and it's always higher. Oh, I'm not hitting the weed. So you got to now account for the accumulation of money on the wheels. So now we're putting together cameras like there's slippage so you're putting odometers like how fast are you actually going, but if it starts slipping and slower, and then so how do we calculate like it's a whole thing? Anyway, so mine and density of weeds. Those are the biggest challenges that we see. Are hardening the robot. We've learned a ton, I think so. This goes all back to I think we have the most the best hardened out there autonomous solar power system, ground roving system. Like anywhere I add on and maybe military has something that is not commercially available, but we believe that we have that. So the challenge the challenge here that I see from a business perspective, and I love to pick your brain on is because you guys see a lot of different types of tech and use cases for technology like this is that we're making impact in agriculture, in row crops in the Midwest, but the level of investment that's required to scale this up as a business, it's a multi year process. And so what I'm actually looking for is like the Tesla Tesla Model by the way, the reason why it's much longer is because the the farmers margins are so small on their businesses that you cannot be so extractive you cannot charge like a crazy amount, right for for the farmers. What I'm actually looking for is think about the beautiful like the autonomous solar powered part of outdoor can live in rural with communications. Oh, by the way, these are all mesh network work. I think a lot of networking and so the thought came from

I forgot the name of the company. There's a company out of Israel. That is doing really, really good in
S Speaker 221:59these construction sites, they need radar and a bunch of sensors, all these people different people. Today that industry is that manually a lot of people come in with these sensors and then they haven't tell what's under the ground. And for insurance companies to to be able to write off that loan which is underwrite that loan, which is they come with the sensors, all the different suites. of sensors and then they will assess what's under the whether it's a rock, always a pipe or whether whatever that is before digging. And and then these guys have come up with what you have come up with with like a very proprietary suite of sensors that that puts together a very clear picture of what's under the ground. And they're able to charge a lot of money for it because it's still much cheaper than bringing all these people out and much faster. So there's that one example of one company that I know that is robots that are doing this and and they're doing really really well because they're able to charge a lot of money but but I mean So you've had this for
these construction sites, they need radar and a bunch of sensors, all these people different people.

Now take that took years to do that. I really do believe that there is something there by the way I get I get a ton of ideas about the robots, landmines, fertilizer detection, dig, like that. There's a bunch of things that just always, always kind of crops up. I'm looking for a like, hell yeah, like that's what we should be going after, in conjunction. Right because I really view this as as a platform and not as a individual, single use robot. And as your competitors though, I don't think they could ever try to pull off one word, right? You wouldn't take like a laser shooting robot that hits to a tractor and tries to say, like, this is an autonomous something that can for different use case.

S Speaker 125:35whether outdoors, hardware software problems, you know, that's all that's all. That was what our year one was going to be? Right? It just happens that the actuators that we attach to the bottom of the robot. Yeah, it just happens that the week, right? That's one that's the that's the business that we're going after initially. But there's so much other use cases where I think it's

S Speaker 226:14I agree. I agree. I think the industry is that you have to look at for this several, you know, promise. So we just invested in one company. I won't name their name, because it's not public yet. Out of Europe. That's putting the sensors on.

S Speaker 226:41spot and then there again, they're also so they're not doing under the ground there. It's more about what's on top, which is the resetting you know, places like defense and places like construction and mining and all these different places. Where they put sensors on top. And, and then essentially, these robots walk these spaces, and then they're able to build a 3d model of that space. They're able to do predictive maintenance and then assess and they're also it gets used for insurance and
spot and then there again, they're also so they're not doing under the ground there.

S Speaker 227:18There's, I mean, what we're seeing is we're seeing more and more robots that are semi autonomous, tele operated, and then the same thing you know, one is to a few robots that that are getting used for different types

S Speaker 227:40So it's happening. There's another company called Field AI that is doing something similar if you were to look at it, I mean, not under the ground. It's again over the ground, but ideas similar, which is in spaces where you want sensors to monitor for maintenance, and insurance purposes. Then, then you have robots to do it because it's more efficient. So I think you have to find out your value prop your value prop is you can put sensors under these robots and then you build these robots, most of these other companies that are using existing robots because they're only assessing things that are on top.

Right. I see. So feel that so. So we still need a payload to go and do something.
S Speaker 228:43Well, they build their payload like if you take a look at sensors, like we have a bunch of videos, right? So if you take a look at the sensors, we put on top of these robots, that their sensor suite, but but the robot itself, it's either
