I think, I think one distinction between the enterprise motion and going directly to customers, it could be developers or consumers or influencers, is the ramp up that we see, right? So enterprise motion will not ramp up from one to 30 million in whatever 12 to 18 months, right? It'll take a long time. So I think then it's a different style of business, different pace of revenue growth. And I think we need to have a framework of, you know, how do we evaluate companies that are breaking out, which is zero to 50 in like two years, versus an enterprise motion that can, that can still grow fast, but how fast is that fast, right? What I'm trying to say is, we'll not get these, any of these peak, peak outs or breakthroughs with selling it to the large enterprises.

here's what I'm going to this afternoon, not this afternoon, maybe tomorrow morning. I'm going to use chat GPT to reason through this. So my prompts are like, because the reason why is essentially right now, across we've got, we've looked at over seven, eight companies in this space. Almost everybody has had some form of viral growth. We thought creative was vital. And freaking Open Art and Higgs field are

Speaker 2
So, so creative is zero to 14 and 15 months. Open Art is zero to 30 in 15 months. Higgs field is zero to 45 in four months. So so so the viral pandemic. across all of these and then a cool is also zero to 1440, and 18 months, or something like that, right? So the viral growth, the only difference across all of them is, I guess, the margin profile, for some reason create he has a significantly better margin profile. Higgs field is only operating at 30% gross margin profile, so we need to dig into that as to why, if that's fundamentally, if there is any like tech differentiation that is causing these companies to have a different margin profile, but otherwise, from a tech stack standpoint, also, they look very similar. They're post training, open source models, and they're applying some special tech on top. Teams standpoint, I think the only team I feel like create is the only one that has some researchers. Everybody else has no researchers creating the furthest behind, if I would say in terms of ARR compared to the rest now, but, but, but in terms of researchers and the other like Higgs field, I don't know it's been we talked to them. There's four business guys here, and then 33 engineering in Kazakhstan. I've never heard teams in Kazakhstan.

That's a first, but,
Speaker 2
and then, so all these teams are also not your typical AI native teams that we typically look at and everybody's personal. So the filters of traction are very I don't think the traction filter applies.

The filter of team is also very hard
The filter of team is also very hard
The filter of team is also very hard
The filter of team is also very hard
Speaker 2
or maybe the team filter exists. The filter of tech is very hard. The filter of tech, I think is very, very hard, because nobody has proprietary tech in this space. So then, what are the other filters do we apply? So one is, of course, you have to see enterprise, because these pro somewhere is, at some point, like we discussed, there's, there was lensa, I don't know if somebody knows what how mid journey is doing. Now, like the trend, at least, I know mid journey still probably gets a lot of revenue, but I don't know how mid journeys trend is now, since the tech became commodity, does anybody know how mid journey revenues have trended?
or maybe the team filter exists. The filter of tech is very hard. The filter of tech, I think is very, very hard, because nobody has proprietary tech in this space.

No, haven't looked at it.
No, haven't looked at it.
No, haven't looked at it.
No, haven't looked at it.
Speaker 2
Lensa. We were discussing was another one. Lensa in 20 December, 2022 with AI image generation. They went one month. They went to 40 million ARR then entire last year, and they closed at 18 or 23 they closed

Speaker 6
uh, we actually see similar, similar trend with Luma AI. Yeah, they got to, you know, I think they got to like 20 plus moving. They got to like 1517, we talked to in March. Then by June, they only get it 20 something.
uh, we actually see similar, similar trend with Luma AI. Yeah, they got to, you know, I think they got to like 20 plus moving. They got to like 1517, we talked to in March. Then by June, they only get it 20 something.

Speaker 4
That's, yeah, I think was something to draw parallel with. Could be coding, coding agents. People thought that the whole moat is around workflows and user experience, right? And model is a commodity, right? Now, these model vendors are getting into coding as well. It'll be good to see how the cursors of the world, right? They hit

Speaker 2
really well. So cursor is still doing. I got the data on cursor, and then you saw, you saw the windsurf ended up raising at a much higher valuation as well. So not, not windsurfer cognition, cognition, I ended up so these coding tools, what they're doing is, so the pendulum swinging back to essentially foundation model, which was found in foundation initially started with foundation model is commodity. Let's just build workflows which will not be commodity. Yeah. Now Foundation models also started building workflows. So okay, foundation models are not commodity to now, back again, where, where, cursor, cognition, everybody is building their own models, because essentially, with RL, what's happening is, once you get enough data for how people are using your coding tool, you can run RL environments, and you can keep training on RL environments, and you can keep improving the accuracy with an open source model that is that actually is on par or even better with the foundation models. So and then the cost of training post training these. So the pendulum is training back into like it's interesting how, you know, however, I think cursor went, the benefit that cursor had was they went in a land grab mode, so the capital raise, and then the big brands that they were able to attract capital from tier one, VCs, allowed them to get into enterprise accounts, and then, and then, once they've got those lands, they're expanding in that and then they can keep changing the tech stack and all that. So enterprise, early enterprise motion, along with prosumer. I mean, I think current, in case of cursor, the truth is there's no true prosumer like for coding, in most cases, its employees, even the prosumer part is its employees within companies, yeah,
really well. So cursor is still doing. I got the data on cursor, and then you saw, you saw the windsurf ended up raising at a much higher valuation as well.

Speaker 4
versus like the image and the video Gen space, it's like, is to prosumer. And I think maybe in the developer side, the distinction could be that, you know, developer swiping a credit card right, versus, let's say, a master service MSA agreement with or a contract with an enterprise. I think that's where I draw the distinction, which is, let's say if at Qualcomm five developers using it, that's still somewhere between prosumer and enterprise, but not enterprise. But if you have a contract with Qualcomm, that completely changes the game. So it'll be interesting to see when cursor and all these Devin and all of these guys translated from Hey Qualcomm, 10 engineers were using it. Now we are deployed across 2000 because we have a contract. I don't know when that transition happened. That'll be interesting to see if it can be replicated in video generation. And I don't, I don't think the influencer side is the way to go. I have a, I have a strong point of view of finding use cases that are, you know, tailoring to certain enterprises and certain value props.

Speaker 7
distinction happens. So I've put together some slides Tushar and I've tried to cover some of these questions that we have discussed. Maybe we can go through that. I will skip the initial primer slides and come to the point where we actually discuss from product tech and metrics perspective on how do we create a framework to evaluate some of these companies. The first discussion, the first point, was around how the world is changing. And I think we can skip through this, but very quick punchline here is that AI slope is already here. We see the barrier of creating content reducing, which means that a lot of people can start generating content. And as there's there's a principle called right law, which means that as the cost to generate something goes down, the demand goes down, to some extent, until new markets form. And we don't know how some of those new markets will form, in terms of short form video that happened last time when Tiktok and reel started creating short form videos, and we saw a completely new market of short form videos. But some directions on where this go is we will see a lot of radical experimentation. We will see video localization, which is a lot of very cultural specific video coming in. And video will start getting deeper into long tail, both in terms of SMBs and prosumers adopting it for solutions where video was typically not adopted before, but also in terms of use cases where video was too expensive and now it starts getting there, and regulations are also following up. Like what would be an example creation? An example
distinction happens. So I've put together some slides Tushar and I've tried to cover some of these questions that we have discussed. Maybe we can go through that. I will skip the initial primer slides and come to the point where we actually discuss from product tech and metrics perspective on how do we create a framework to evaluate some of these companies. The first discussion, the first point, was around how the world is changing. And I think we can skip through this, but very quick punchline here is that AI slope is already here. We see the barrier of creating content reducing, which means that a lot of people can start generating content. And as there's there's a principle called right law, which means that as the cost to generate something goes down, the demand goes down, to some extent, until new markets form. And we don't know how some of those new markets will form, in terms of short form video that happened last time when Tiktok and reel started creating short form videos, and we saw a completely new market of short form videos. But some directions on where this go is we will see a lot of radical experimentation. We will see video localization, which is a lot of very cultural specific video coming in. And video will start getting deeper into long tail, both in terms of SMBs and prosumers adopting it for solutions where video was typically not adopted before, but also in terms of use cases where video was too expensive and now it starts getting there, and regulations are also following up. Like what would be an example creation? An example

So to Deepak question, I've tried to map out all the spaces where video or generative video, can have an impact. Try to see what the market size for some of these areas could be. My personal notes on the last segment, how adoption is going on. Some of these markets are on the price. Some of them are for prosumer. But to previous question, customer support could be somewhere where video was not there. Companies like Live X are coming in, where for for churn, retention, you're using video today, but previously it was just a pop up video, pop up dialog box, things like that. So there are a lot of applications where video was not really feasible, and that comes to the point of the cost to create videos. So we'll come to this later. But the cost to create videos, I was just mapping it out from some of the other players an agency usually takes 10k per minute of explainer video generation, which has now dropped to two to $3.20 $5 at max, with VO three. So the cost to generate video has dropped significantly, and hence the adoption for a lot of these industries will increase. I think we can spend some time, if we're going top down, to understand which industries we want to invest in, and if enterprise is the right answer to find an industry, we can spend some time here and map the right segments. But because we have a lot of companies today active deal in advertisement, have like, dead deeper into that in some of the following slides.

Speaker 2
you know, loom started using short form video for people to communicate within the organization and people to communicate outside the organization. And then I remember all these startups sending started sending loom videos of like, explainer videos and everything i and that essentially happened, because, again, the cost of generation for those videos was lower, I would imagine, for it with Gen AI, that goes even lower.

Speaker 7
Yeah, I was, I was using loom a couple of days back to create something, and they've inculcated a lot of AI features, auto creates, captions, tags, different segments of the video edits, a lot of filler words and things like that. So it's making it more professional.

Speaker 4
But maybe one, one thing to maybe unpack is in each of these segments, right? Are there, you know, category leaders that exist, right? Or it could be a platform play, or it could be, you know, companies that can leverage video generate or Gen AI to augment their platform, I think something to unpack would be newer use cases coming versus existing market, and then incorporating AI within those existing market, right? So in each of these, do we like loom? Is this? Are Are they doing? It'd be good to see if they are doing anything with Jenny, I'm guessing. So, right? So something, something to think about, because the differentiation is, is is not much, and it's very easy to there's no barrier to entry, right? You can, you can take a large product and, you know, get into video generation easily. So that's the threat that you run into.

Speaker 7
Yeah, that's a fair point. Deepak for some of these spaces, like corporate lnd, enterprise comms, companies like Synthesia and hayjan are doing they probably would be the marketing leader in Gen AI applying Gen AI for some of these industries, probably customer support, real time, Avatar, those markets are more nascent, so I don't think there is a market leader today. Yeah, I.
Yeah, that's a fair point.

Yeah, I.
Speaker 1
You, just last month, you talked to another one, whisper, right?
Whisper is different. Whisper is
Speaker 2
speech to text, not AI voices. This is speech. Whisper is speech to text. But whisper also has had this viral growth. Last six months, they got this viral growth from both crossover enterprise. We'll see how that all right, like
Speaker 3
in my in my brain, I I categorize speech to text within the AI, voice like otter.ai similar otter.ai also AR rampart,
oh, yeah, like, Otter, yeah.
Otter has over 100 million. Yeah.
Speaker 4
I think, I think one distinction between the enterprise motion and going directly to customers, it could be developers or consumers or influencers, is the ramp up that we see, right? So enterprise motion will not ramp up from one to 30 million in whatever 12 to 18 months, right? It'll take a long time. So I think then it's a different style of business, different pace of revenue growth. And I think we need to have a framework of, you know, how do we evaluate companies that are breaking out, which is zero to 50 in like two years, versus an enterprise motion that can, that can still grow fast, but how fast is that fast, right? What I'm trying to say is, we'll not get these, any of these peak, peak outs or breakthroughs with selling it to the large enterprises.
Speaker 2
I mean, even there, I think we've seen it with 11 laps.
Speaker 5
How fast 11 growth. It wasn't
okay. So let's, let's take a
Speaker 2
here's what I'm going to this afternoon, not this afternoon, maybe tomorrow morning. I'm going to use chat GPT to reason through this. So my prompts are like, because the reason why is essentially right now, across we've got, we've looked at over seven, eight companies in this space. Almost everybody has had some form of viral growth. We thought creative was vital. And freaking Open Art and Higgs field are
more viral.
Speaker 2
So, so creative is zero to 14 and 15 months. Open Art is zero to 30 in 15 months. Higgs field is zero to 45 in four months. So so so the viral pandemic. across all of these and then a cool is also zero to 1440, and 18 months, or something like that, right? So the viral growth, the only difference across all of them is, I guess, the margin profile, for some reason create he has a significantly better margin profile. Higgs field is only operating at 30% gross margin profile, so we need to dig into that as to why, if that's fundamentally, if there is any like tech differentiation that is causing these companies to have a different margin profile, but otherwise, from a tech stack standpoint, also, they look very similar. They're post training, open source models, and they're applying some special tech on top. Teams standpoint, I think the only team I feel like create is the only one that has some researchers. Everybody else has no researchers creating the furthest behind, if I would say in terms of ARR compared to the rest now, but, but, but in terms of researchers and the other like Higgs field, I don't know it's been we talked to them. There's four business guys here, and then 33 engineering in Kazakhstan. I've never heard teams in Kazakhstan.
That's a first, but,
Speaker 2
and then, so all these teams are also not your typical AI native teams that we typically look at and everybody's personal. So the filters of traction are very I don't think the traction filter applies.
The filter of team is also very hard
in these
Speaker 2
or maybe the team filter exists. The filter of tech is very hard. The filter of tech, I think is very, very hard, because nobody has proprietary tech in this space. So then, what are the other filters do we apply? So one is, of course, you have to see enterprise, because these pro somewhere is, at some point, like we discussed, there's, there was lensa, I don't know if somebody knows what how mid journey is doing. Now, like the trend, at least, I know mid journey still probably gets a lot of revenue, but I don't know how mid journeys trend is now, since the tech became commodity, does anybody know how mid journey revenues have trended?
No, haven't looked at it.
Speaker 2
Lensa. We were discussing was another one. Lensa in 20 December, 2022 with AI image generation. They went one month. They went to 40 million ARR then entire last year, and they closed at 18 or 23 they closed
Speaker 6
uh, we actually see similar, similar trend with Luma AI. Yeah, they got to, you know, I think they got to like 20 plus moving. They got to like 1517, we talked to in March. Then by June, they only get it 20 something.
Speaker 4
That's, yeah, I think was something to draw parallel with. Could be coding, coding agents. People thought that the whole moat is around workflows and user experience, right? And model is a commodity, right? Now, these model vendors are getting into coding as well. It'll be good to see how the cursors of the world, right? They hit
Speaker 2
really well. So cursor is still doing. I got the data on cursor, and then you saw, you saw the windsurf ended up raising at a much higher valuation as well. So not, not windsurfer cognition, cognition, I ended up so these coding tools, what they're doing is, so the pendulum swinging back to essentially foundation model, which was found in foundation initially started with foundation model is commodity. Let's just build workflows which will not be commodity. Yeah. Now Foundation models also started building workflows. So okay, foundation models are not commodity to now, back again, where, where, cursor, cognition, everybody is building their own models, because essentially, with RL, what's happening is, once you get enough data for how people are using your coding tool, you can run RL environments, and you can keep training on RL environments, and you can keep improving the accuracy with an open source model that is that actually is on par or even better with the foundation models. So and then the cost of training post training these. So the pendulum is training back into like it's interesting how, you know, however, I think cursor went, the benefit that cursor had was they went in a land grab mode, so the capital raise, and then the big brands that they were able to attract capital from tier one, VCs, allowed them to get into enterprise accounts, and then, and then, once they've got those lands, they're expanding in that and then they can keep changing the tech stack and all that. So enterprise, early enterprise motion, along with prosumer. I mean, I think current, in case of cursor, the truth is there's no true prosumer like for coding, in most cases, its employees, even the prosumer part is its employees within companies, yeah,
Speaker 4
versus like the image and the video Gen space, it's like, is to prosumer. And I think maybe in the developer side, the distinction could be that, you know, developer swiping a credit card right, versus, let's say, a master service MSA agreement with or a contract with an enterprise. I think that's where I draw the distinction, which is, let's say if at Qualcomm five developers using it, that's still somewhere between prosumer and enterprise, but not enterprise. But if you have a contract with Qualcomm, that completely changes the game. So it'll be interesting to see when cursor and all these Devin and all of these guys translated from Hey Qualcomm, 10 engineers were using it. Now we are deployed across 2000 because we have a contract. I don't know when that transition happened. That'll be interesting to see if it can be replicated in video generation. And I don't, I don't think the influencer side is the way to go. I have a, I have a strong point of view of finding use cases that are, you know, tailoring to certain enterprises and certain value props.
I think that's where this
Speaker 7
distinction happens. So I've put together some slides Tushar and I've tried to cover some of these questions that we have discussed. Maybe we can go through that. I will skip the initial primer slides and come to the point where we actually discuss from product tech and metrics perspective on how do we create a framework to evaluate some of these companies. The first discussion, the first point, was around how the world is changing. And I think we can skip through this, but very quick punchline here is that AI slope is already here. We see the barrier of creating content reducing, which means that a lot of people can start generating content. And as there's there's a principle called right law, which means that as the cost to generate something goes down, the demand goes down, to some extent, until new markets form. And we don't know how some of those new markets will form, in terms of short form video that happened last time when Tiktok and reel started creating short form videos, and we saw a completely new market of short form videos. But some directions on where this go is we will see a lot of radical experimentation. We will see video localization, which is a lot of very cultural specific video coming in. And video will start getting deeper into long tail, both in terms of SMBs and prosumers adopting it for solutions where video was typically not adopted before, but also in terms of use cases where video was too expensive and now it starts getting there, and regulations are also following up. Like what would be an example creation? An example
would be video, mean video, the
video is already penetrated. Yep.
Speaker 7
So to Deepak question, I've tried to map out all the spaces where video or generative video, can have an impact. Try to see what the market size for some of these areas could be. My personal notes on the last segment, how adoption is going on. Some of these markets are on the price. Some of them are for prosumer. But to previous question, customer support could be somewhere where video was not there.

I think we can spend some time, if we're going top down, to understand which industries we want to invest in, and if enterprise is the right answer to find an industry, we can spend some time here and map the right segments. But because we have a lot of companies today active deal in advertisement, have like, dead deeper into that in some of the following slides.
But then you're saying,
okay, but you're
Speaker 2
but most of these are essentially enterprise, right?
Speaker 7
Yeah, most of these are essentially enterprise, if you probably just the digital video ads. That's a
good point. What was that company?
Loom? Was it loom? Or,
