S Speaker 11:18didn't know otherwise we would have done, would have loved to do this. Yeah, no, no problem at all. Tomas. So I actually spoke to Nick. Nick and I, we did our MBA together at UCLA. And I know him. He, he made, he made sure that I passed a hello from him to you today. So I'm trying to do that, but great for him to introduce us. We had a discussion internally. I've gone through your deck. Seems very interesting, but again, we have not had a lot of investments as a fund in this specific sector, so it's kind of new to us in that way. I'd love to take you like, give you a brief overview about myself. I have some similar backgrounds so which aligns with what you're trying to do. And then a little bit of overview about Qualcomm ventures. And then would love to understand from you on how you're thinking about it, what stage you are in, and know more about unblock from your own words. Perfect,

S Speaker 12:21Tomas, I have spent about three and a half years in clean tech, especially in wind and solar projects. I was there as a business development we, like my company, would set up wind and solar farms, and we would sell a lot of power purchase agreements to corporates in India. So that's what my background has been. I've done a lot of these power purchase agreements, selling it to corporates, Facebook, Amazon, and negotiating the entire process through so I've been in business development, corporate development. I sort of understand this industry. I haven't come across methane flaring as a technology, but would love to know about that from you. And then, more recently, I'm currently working at Qualcomm ventures as a senior associate, I have been with the team for about eight months now, after my after graduation from UCLA and our fund, the fund itself has been around for 25 years. We invest out of the balance sheet of Qualcomm and typically in the Americas market, we tend to invest about 150 $280 million a year. So we are actively deploying capital right now. Check sizes are between two to ten million and we are preferably a Series A investors. Sometimes we do seed as well. Our focus areas are in AI IoT, industrial automation, automobile tech stack, XR so anything which, in a way, interfaces with Compute and connectivity is what is very exciting to us. And that's where I feel unblock computing, especially your plans to sort of expand into powering computing, is very exciting. And particularly me and Carlos, we are also now taking a more strategic look into clean tech, specifically electrification. We feel there are a lot of opportunities there, and at times, we have been opportunistic about this industry, but we haven't really had a thesis and a very strategic overlook at the space. So we're trying to start that practice right now, and that's where, again, there is another intersection point and why we were more excited about learning about unblock more from you.

S Speaker 24:25Awesome. Yeah, I saw Carlos is in the board of Spain, which is one of the it's, it's one of the few companies like in the past few years, kind of like in electrification, but I would have invested. It's a really interesting company. Yeah. So the team is amazing. So that's cool. That's really cool. Yeah, so actually, I think when I was talking to Nick, like, a week, two weeks ago, we were, we were in the middle of raising money, because what's kind of going on with us, like, we have, like, a really boring thesis, but boring sometimes makes a lot of money, and our my thesis, my personal thesis, is that there's a lot of technology in the US that also, like, this is more like a personal thing, but like, there's a lot of technology that, thanks to the, like, University of national loves, complex of the US, plus public funding, plus amazing private funding, there's like, companies that get created in the US that it's hard to create them, like, anywhere, you know, anywhere else in the world. I agree, because, like, you know, like, there's like amazing engineering times in, like, China, Argentina, India, but like, a lot of us come to the US because, like, the capital and kind of, like network and a lot of scientists and stuff is here, but I, but like, a lot of stuff gets, like, really long to grow into, like, Southeast Asia, Africa, in America. So I kind of like focus myself on that for the past seven years and and I found basically this intersection of like this company in Colorado called cruso energy, that they were aiming to power the next generation of high performance computing, AI becoming using my wasted energy. And if you look at the future, like right now, there's a lot of wasted energy, like gas flaring, but if you look towards the future, there's going to be less gas flaring, but there's going to be a lot of more. Lot of more wasted energy in renewables, because renewals are inherently volatile, and you cannot add electricity, you cannot store it unless you have batteries. But it's like, it's always going to be like, expensive to store because we store energy, you need volumetric density. So we they thought it was like an interesting opportunity to use data centers as a way to, like, kind of like arbitrage energy on the grid. Yeah. And we, we basically developed a relationship with Kusa. We brought their business to Latin America, starting from Argentina. Why Argentina? Argentina last year was a really hard place to do business. It was like politically extremely unstable, but is sitting on one of the largest and one of the only growing like reservoirs of hydrocarbons in the world. And they are developing really fast and and because of that, is the country where flaring through the fastest in the past, like from from 2017 to 2022 is the country we're flaring through the fastest, right? And we created this company that basically what we do, it's like we we grab cruises technology, and we build, like an operations and engineering team and a local like network of investors that reduce a lot of our risk, and we deployed projects doing flare mitigation in Patagonia of Argentina. Today, we have two operational projects that makes us the second largest company doing this, like using flare gas to power computing, or like in the process of building two more projects that will, like, increase our size by a lot. And that's until two weeks ago that I was talking with Nick. We're looking to raise capital to finance those projects, because we're kind of, like, in a rush to deploy those projects. Yeah, and now taking, kind of like a back step for two reasons. One is, I we managed to to finance a lot of those projects with debt, like from like vendors, like vendor financing, kind of like, pull it off using vendor financing. And second, what's happening to us, which is, like, really, really interesting, is that
Awesome. Yeah, I saw Carlos is in the board of Spain, which is one of the it's, it's one of the few companies like in the past few years, kind of like in electrification, but I would have invested.

S Speaker 28:46there's so much associated gas to oil production, and the gas market is so small that I believe it's, it's going to turn into, like an AI. It's one of the half to train AI. Why? Because like, AI, in the next few years, like four years, is going to need like, if you look at like, the training of Frontier models, unless most people are wrong, it seems I want to need like, gigawatts of energy to train AI. And if you look at the US, it's going to be really hard to scale like, like energy generation to meet those requirements. So people are starting to talk about training like GPT six in the Middle East, but I think there's going to be a lot of like, national security concerns to train the next generation of laws in the Middle East. Yeah, when you start looking at the map, one of the only places in the world where, like, I work to reduce emissions, but like this next generation of AI is going to get trained with with gas, with natural gas. Why? Because there's no other technology that you can scale as fast that you cannot scale as fast you're gonna scale as fast like nuclear energy or renewables. So so when you look at the world map, I've been one of the only places where you can grow gas production really fast. And indeed, it's gonna grow because people are growing oil production, and oil is coming with a lot of associated gas. So
there's so much associated gas to oil production, and the gas market is so small that I believe it's, it's going to turn into, like an AI. It's one of the half to train AI. Why? Because like, AI, in the next few years, like four years, is going to need like, if you look at like, the training of Frontier models, unless most people are wrong, it seems I want to need like, gigawatts of energy to train AI.

Yeah, when you start looking at the map, one of the only places in the world where, like, I work to reduce emissions, but like this next generation of AI is going to get trained with with gas, with natural gas. Why? Because there's no other technology that you can scale as fast that you cannot scale as fast you're gonna scale as fast like nuclear energy or renewables. So so when you look at the world map, I've been one of the only places where you can grow gas production really fast. And indeed, it's gonna grow because people are growing oil production, and oil is coming with a lot of associated gas. So
there's so much associated gas to oil production, and the gas market is so small that I believe it's, it's going to turn into, like an AI. It's one of the half to train AI. Why? Because like, AI, in the next few years, like four years, is going to need like, if you look at like, the training of Frontier models, unless most people are wrong, it seems I want to need like, gigawatts of energy to train AI. And if you look at the US, it's going to be really hard to scale like, like energy generation to meet those requirements.

S Speaker 210:17oil company CEOs have been begging us to take more gas from them. So, like, we're not 100 megawatts of glass, hundreds of megawatts, and at the same time that the world is now looking to train AI. So I kind of like slow down on the fundraising and reassessing a little bit our strategy, because I thought, as a founder, we were going to do like, two more years of Bitcoin mining, because we know how to deploy those assets, right? But I think the market is pointing to us, like, hey, like, you have a lot of energy. We need to build these, like, AI data centers. Like, hurry up. And curso is our partner who's building 400 megawatts of AI for Oracle. It's like, until a month ago, they were like, Oh, we're not gonna do AI in Argentina. There's like, there's no way we can do it. And now they are like, hey, actually, I'm blocked. We need you to move faster. Because, like, we're gonna need to be doing AI in Argentina or, like, the southern corner of Latin America, because we can also do it in Chile, with us from Argentina or southern Brazil. So I'm kind of like, I'm sorry to be like an ideal, like, like, not really clear on what our fundraising strategy at the moment, but I think it's a good moment to get to know each other, because that's kind of like the strategic decision we're taking

S Speaker 111:30Absolutely, Thomas, I totally understand that and appreciate your decision, for sure. That was also a very interesting overview. I did not know that the intersection of high performance computing demand plus energy requirements, would eventually take you to Argentina. That's a very thought provoking thought. If you if you have more, yeah, I

If you if you have more, yeah, I
S Speaker 211:51know many people are thinking, Oh, that. But when you start looking at like the world map and you're like, Okay, there's a new list. There's like, the US that that I think a lot of citizens are building the US, but there's going to be, like, a limitation to that, and then, like, Argentina has a huge develop gas potential that is not developing it because there's no market. Some people are not seeing gas production growing, not because it's no gas, because it's no market, but you can get a lot of reaching gaps on
know many people are thinking, Oh, that. But when you start looking at like the world map and you're like, Okay, there's a new list.

S Speaker 112:24there. That's that's very exciting Tomas, we as a team. We have a team in Brazil, and that basically focuses on the entire late am market. I don't think it's under their radar that right now, we should be looking at this market for energy generation, or possibly High Performance Computing powering but that's a very interesting thought. If you have more notes around this, or if you have done any research, I'd love to take a look at that. Would love to educate myself on this.

S Speaker 212:50I'll send it to you. I think most of our notes is kind of like an internal, like, internal research. But I was actually going to put together like a, like a, like a few pages, or, like, some slides, like explaining, kind of like this, more like, macro view, well, I'll send you that probably, like, like, you know, we got a half after a third time a week, for sure. That's kind of the reason why I'm in San Francisco to, like, see all, like, like, a bunch of friends from Stanford. Like, I'm working on open AI and stuff, and I'm kind of like gathering data to develop that, that
I'll send it to you. I think most of our notes is kind of like an internal, like, internal research.

S Speaker 113:27Thomas, I would certainly appreciate that. So in terms of fundraising, I think you're taking a step back. You're possibly still doing these projects, the couple of projects you discussed about, but those would mostly be funded by debt. Is that true?
Thomas, I would certainly appreciate that. So in terms of fundraising, I think you're taking a step back. You're possibly still doing these projects, the couple of projects you discussed about, but those would mostly be funded by debt. Is that true?

S Speaker 213:40Yeah. So mostly find it by that. And I think we're like, we're like, we need, we basically need to be like, we have 15 megawatts of projects operating. Just female Watts is not that much. It's like 30,000 homes or negarata Center is not that much, but, but that makes us like, the second largest doing, like, mining on the oil field, because mining in the oil field sounds easy, but it's extremely hard. And and the only company that was kind of able to scale it was Crusoe. And then we using some of cruces knowledge, we're doing it, yeah, and these next 23 megawatts of projects, we can do them with like, little capex and like a lot of debt. So we might be putting like, I think we're short, like three or $4 million but I may put like, either through like our current investors, or I may put that money myself as kind of like project financing will say. But I think most probably one of those projects, project financing, and then take a step back and decide, because I think the, and it's not even about the valuation, it's like a totally different, like, strategy, though, that we should tell you we're gonna be focusing more in AI. And I mean, the business of being really clear, like, I mean really like, it to where we amazing investors, and I walk and I like being, like, really dear to investors in like, Okay, what's the, what's the path that I'm seeing for a company can change,
Yeah. So mostly find it by that. And I think we're like, we're like, we need, we basically need to be like, we have 15 megawatts of projects operating. Just female Watts is not that much. It's like 30,000 homes or negarata Center is not that much, but, but that makes us like, the second largest doing, like, mining on the oil field, because mining in the oil field sounds easy, but it's extremely hard.

but not be raising, like, money with a Bitcoin story,
but not be raising, like, money with a Bitcoin story,
15:12if we are focusing more in AI or the opposite too.
S Speaker 115:15Absolutely. I totally appreciate that, Tomas, and I understand your rationale behind that. Like, back when I used to work in clean tech, we would finance a lot of our projects with debt. Our ratio would typically be 30% equity, 70% debt, and that worked really well, especially when the interest rates were low. So I totally understand the rationale behind why you are doing that. One question that I have is, what's your timeline of shifting from BTC mining to, let's say, powering computing, and how are you thinking about that? Why do you think that has been expedited so fast, so soon?
Absolutely. I totally appreciate that, Tomas, and I understand your rationale behind that. Like, back when I used to work in clean tech, we would finance a lot of our projects with debt. Our ratio would typically be 30% equity, 70% debt, and that worked really well, especially when the interest rates were low. So I totally understand the rationale behind why you are doing that.

One question that I have is, what's your timeline of shifting from BTC mining to, let's say, powering computing, and how are you thinking about that? Why do you think that has been expedited so fast, so soon?
S Speaker 215:52No, I think it's been expedited so fast because the market is asking for it. Like, from my perspective, it's like, okay, we should be building the Bitcoin mining because that allows us to build like a series of assets, and nothing in our assets, in an accounting way, but in a strategic way. That's allowing us to be like a series of assets and kind of, like self maintaining it, yeah, on, on the oil field in Argentina, to give you an example. Or like, building a team of like, like, electronics repairs teams. We're building our like, like, electric Electric Power team that we're going to be both for becoming an AI and a lot of relationships with the local, like, unions, with the with the Native Americans, which is like, a big concern for all companies. They actually love me. They invite me for like, lunch every time there, because we're reducing pollution and relationship with the government. I'm actually the person writing, like, a change of law in in that area, in the province, yeah, to basically eliminate local taxes for data centers like the governor of the province asked me to do it. So the fact that we're doing big combining is like generating, like, a lot of like, like, an operational muscle for us down there. So I think these next two projects that all companies are asking us, we're going to build them, but in parallel, most of my time is going to focus on like, identifying like, the ideal sites to the data centers, like, like, all the groundwork that we need to do to start, kind of, like setting up this. And the main thing you know priyesh is like securing the energy, like securing the gas and securing the right partners to do like, part of the kind of like decisions and investment and stuff, but, but it's kind of like, I'm gonna have more glide in next few weeks, but, but I think it's kind of like an immediate shift. So we're not gonna stop building this Bitcoin mining data centers, because we're also not building small ones. We're building big ones. We're building like, like, we're growing our 10 megawatt data center to 40 megawatts, which is probably the largest bitcoin miner data center with learners in the world, right? And but, and it's not taking us, it's taking us time, but that time coaches my team, like trains my team, but it's not taking much capital. But then myself and more, kind of, like the management team, more and more focus on, on, on AI as of today, like as of now,
No, I think it's been expedited so fast because the market is asking for it. Like, from my perspective, it's like, okay, we should be building the Bitcoin mining because that allows us to build like a series of assets, and nothing in our assets, in an accounting way, but in a strategic way.

So I think these next two projects that all companies are asking us, we're going to build them, but in parallel, most of my time is going to focus on like, identifying like, the ideal sites to the data centers, like, like, all the groundwork that we need to do to start, kind of, like setting up this. And the main thing you know priyesh is like securing the energy, like securing the gas and securing the right partners to do like, part of the kind of like decisions and investment and stuff, but, but it's kind of like, I'm gonna have more glide in next few weeks, but, but I think it's kind of like an immediate shift. So we're not gonna stop building this Bitcoin mining data centers, because we're also not building small ones. We're building big ones. We're building like, like, we're growing our 10 megawatt data center to 40 megawatts, which is probably the largest bitcoin miner data center with learners in the world, right? And but, and it's not taking us, it's taking us time, but that time coaches my team, like trains my team, but it's not taking much capital. But then myself and more, kind of, like the management team, more and more focus on, on, on AI as of today, like as of now,
No, I think it's been expedited so fast because the market is asking for it. Like, from my perspective, it's like, okay, we should be building the Bitcoin mining because that allows us to build like a series of assets, and nothing in our assets, in an accounting way, but in a strategic way. That's allowing us to be like a series of assets and kind of, like self maintaining it, yeah, on, on the oil field in Argentina, to give you an example. Or like, building a team of like, like, electronics repairs teams. We're building our like, like, electric Electric Power team that we're going to be both for becoming an AI and a lot of relationships with the local, like, unions, with the with the Native Americans, which is like, a big concern for all companies. They actually love me. They invite me for like, lunch every time there, because we're reducing pollution and relationship with the government. I'm actually the person writing, like, a change of law in in that area, in the province, yeah, to basically eliminate local taxes for data centers like the governor of the province asked me to do it. So the fact that we're doing big combining is like generating, like, a lot of like, like, an operational muscle for us down there.

But then myself and more, kind of, like the management team, more and more focus on, on, on AI as of today, like as of now,
S Speaker 118:33yeah, yeah, absolutely that. That makes a lot of sense. Tomas, thanks for that. I am just curious, like, given I've been involved in wind, solar, carbon credit, kind of projects. Would love to understand what's the technical infrastructure that goes into building, maintain, flaring projects, how is it very different, and what kind of operational expertise do you think you need for such projects?
yeah, yeah, absolutely that. That makes a lot of sense. Tomas, thanks for that. I am just curious, like, given I've been involved in wind, solar, carbon credit, kind of projects.

S Speaker 218:56Yeah. So for, for, like, for like, AI data centers, it's got, it's going to look like a normal data center, because you're going to have to put the data center next to a pipeline. You're not going to be able to put, like a GPU cluster in the middle of the oil field, like we do with mining. But mining basically to answer your question, and I'll show you a picture, yeah.
Yeah. So for, for, like, for like, AI data centers, it's got, it's going to look like a normal data center, because you're going to have to put the data center next to a pipeline. You're not going to be able to put, like a GPU cluster in the middle of the oil field, like we do with mining. But mining basically to answer your question, and I'll show you a picture, yeah.

S Speaker 219:31So this is one of our sites, okay? And basically, there's like, oil production here. These are three oil wells and plus two oil wells that are here, and they bring the oil through a pipe produce like $150 million of oil per year. And and the oil gets separated here between oil and gas, yeah, that gets put in a pipeline that's underneath the ground and shipped to the market to make money, and the gas used to be flared here. What we do now is we take the gas here, I'll show you another picture to and we convert it into electricity. Basically, what we do is, through this yellow pipe, we take that we treated the gas a little bit before, to take out some of the liquids, and then we do modules, like two generators and three data centers. This like our we call them with Crusoe modular data centers. We burn the gas, make electricity, and then the electricity goes to these data centers. And we we that the kind of like, hardest thing is that the flare is unstable, like the gas all the time, changes in heat value and changes in in amount of gas, like gas pressure. So all these data center as a whole is taking that data from the generators, and we basically have software that makes decisions, or like, how do we operate according to parameters that we take from the generators and the gas? So for example, if, like, somebody shuts down a well, or a well is producing less gas, and we get less gas pressure, if you just keep mining at full speed, you're going to generate vacuum on the line, and then one of the generator is going to turn off. Right? You don't want that to happen, because that generates problem, not only for us, but also for the oil operator, and the oil is going to kick you out. So kind of the secret that Crusoe found was like, the data center is like, following that path and basically guarantee stability for the oil operator. That was kind of one of the things, but, but you could do that manually, but you will need, like, two people in each of these in each of these containers, like one during the day and one at night. But like we do it automatically with software, and we operate these 12 data centers with just one person, right, which makes it profitable and scalable and and we achieve a real utilization of these assets, which is kind of like mind blowing when you, when you when you consider that we're like in the middle of nowhere with, Like, a lot of dust, a lot of heat. But some of the skills we're building in the teams, like electric like electronics repairs, like, like, like, like electrical wiring, network connectivity, and a lot of those are translated to an GPU cluster, because different to a normal data center that each rack of computers consumes like five kilowatts. Our racks consume 100 kilowatts, which is the same thing that I'm like the latest Nvidia unit consumes.
So this is one of our sites, okay? And basically, there's like, oil production here.

S Speaker 223:26the US, from Crusoe, and we're integrating that vertically now, and through, through a partner, which is like a large, modular metallurgical company in Argentina. There were like, we are starting to work like exclusively with them, but that's our idea, to kind of like, integrate the supply chain and for like, a bunch of reasons, and be able to control it tighter, to have it like, closer to us,

S Speaker 123:56right, right? And one question I have, Thomas says on Bitcoin mining, I can imagine that you can sort of modify the mining demand of energy based on how, based on the supply of flaring that you're getting. But how do you do it for data centers?

24:14Well, so for data centers, but that's the thing.
S Speaker 224:18The AI data centers that we build here are going to be totally different than what I should show you. Are going to be like a normal data center, like a huge hangar full of computers, and we're going to be connected to like a, like an actual pipeline.

is from, like, another presentation, but then I don't want
S Speaker 224:57this is basically like, this is not flaring. This is associated gas, okay, right? And this is the curve of associated gas in Argentina today. We're like, here 2024

S Speaker 225:50this is like, like, where we're gonna be taking this from, like, an actual pipeline, not, not like, not in the middle of the desert. So what are you operate like? To operate AI, you need to be like, You need to operate in flat. You cannot modulate AI. You have to, like, run it 100% right, 99%
this is like, like, where we're gonna be taking this from, like, an actual pipeline, not, not like, not in the middle of the desert. So what are you operate like? To operate AI, you need to be like, You need to operate in flat. You cannot modulate AI. You have to, like, run it 100% right, 99%

S Speaker 126:13of time, yeah, yeah. And you, and you plan to power the entire data center just by methane clearing. Or do you have any sort of backup renewable energy source that you also want to use,

S Speaker 226:25no so when are you using like this associative as from oil production in vagam? But it depends, like recently been talking to bankers in this space and some people, some believe that this is such a big volume of associated gas that we're not gonna need, like a backstop source, but, but another was mentioning that if we find a backstop source, it
no so when are you using like this associative as from oil production in vagam?

S Speaker 226:57So I think the backstop source, it's gonna be like a combination of, like, contracts with renewable energy companies, but also just a plane, like, just plain gas from the gas window this, this oil region has an oil window that comes with associated gas and a dry gas window. Right? What we could do? It's like, and one of our investors owns like a big part of the concession on the gas window. And I think we could do like an option contract in which we
So I think the backstop source, it's gonna be like a combination of, like, contracts with renewable energy companies, but also just a plane, like, just plain gas from the gas window this, this oil region has an oil window that comes with associated gas and a dry gas window.

S Speaker 127:51Yeah, yeah. This is this very exciting Tomas. As you can imagine, I come from clean tech, and now I'm an investor in AI, so it's always amazing to find an intersection between the two. It's personally very exciting for me, so I'd love to dig deeper. I understand it's not a fundraising opportunity right now, but would love to stay connected. And would I would do my own set of research in this space. In case I have some curiosity and I have some questions, would love to shoot them your way. And if you feel there is anything that I myself, personally, or the team here at Qualcomm ventures, or Qualcomm broadly, can do for you happy to make those connections as well? Awesome? No, no, it's
