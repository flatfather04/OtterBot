S Speaker 23:38have we set up any of these calls yet? Like, are they already in the pipeline,

S Speaker 13:42not on the calendar yet? So I reached out to platform science, which is, they're similar to Geotab. They work as a reseller partner for the solutions. They're a fleet management company, right? So they do all the connected vehicle work that ELD electronic data logging workflows. They put sensors and stuff in cars and trucks, and then obviously, next time would be the camera solution, or one of the camera solutions. The camera solutions that they can potentially resell on customers as well. So I reached out to them. Hopefully we get, you know, them to ping us back, and then I get asked the CEO to set us up with, you know, like Schneider and Amazon and night swift and a couple of other big customers, so we can talk to them in Geotab as well. So some customers, kind of in different segments of the market, and then some customer channel resellers as well. Because the development of Metro dynas Today, they're starting in fleet management right, starting with video analytics. They do as we discussed on Monday. You know, everyone is kind of, we all end up competing in the same market. Eventually, some guys are starting from the telematics space and kind of working their way up, and some people are starting from the camera space and working their way down metrodyne themselves. So Geotab is a partner today, right? But we want to replicate a lot of what those guys do and sell that connected solution in the future as well, right years out. Yeah. So today, partner with Geotab in the future, they'll also kind of sell a similar solution all in one directly as well. So just getting comfortable with how and when do those competitive dynamics unfold? Right? Like, can we? Can we grab a bunch of slices? I can certainly

S Speaker 25:05take up that slaver. I can start doing my research today or tomorrow morning. And then do you want to set up some sync up time so we can do that ad hoc, as it is required? Yeah, yeah. And I'll let you
take up that slaver. I can start doing my research today or tomorrow morning. And then do you want to set up some sync up time so we can do that ad hoc, as it is required? Yeah, yeah. And I'll let you

S Speaker 15:15know as soon as I start getting kind of those first introductions, then we start scheduling those calls. That's great in the interim, I think it's mainly, you know, trying to get some of this, some process moving forward as well, get the slave stage, because info is one thing. We can kind of convey it verbally to the team, but it's, you know, structure and time spent on slides and jump trying to, you know, keep the process moving. Stage one, stage two. But also takes a ton of time. So, you know, we can figure out what needs to be in there and and then how to present it ultimately, at the end today. So

5:41we can work on that.
5:42Maybe if we want to, want to, you know, sync up either, you know, but if

S Speaker 25:58that'd be great, yeah. And on the financials, though rich you mentioned, David is taking a part of it, so he calculations, all the financial discounting, going through the model and everything, to be clear on that front, yeah.
that'd be great, yeah. And on the financials, though rich you mentioned, David is taking a part of it, so he calculations, all the financial discounting, going through the model and everything, to be clear on that front, yeah.

6:09And we can, we can, you know, tag team together as well. So
And we can, we can, you know, tag team together as well. So
And we can, we can, you know, tag team together as well. So
And we can, we can, you know, tag team together as well. So
S Speaker 16:11we're gonna have a call to CFO to kind of step forward, walk through the model. So we all understand that. But just this way, it's efficient. You're not kind of spending your days and hours modeling, unless you want to. You're welcome to. I just didn't see that as a lot of value. It's more around kind of the business that I want to do more like I would call the semantics of the model, right? Because it's, you know, we're going to come up with multiples. We're going to come up with our own base case. I think it's, it's, it's coming up with, you know, what do we think the market is in the base case? And then the modeling is just what falls out of it right at the end of the day. So we can kind of test David with doing the semantics of, kind of running them, which I'll do as well. I'm a finance guy, so

6:47I'm always in the model anyway.
I'm always in the model anyway.
I'm always in the model anyway.
I'm always in the model anyway.
6:50Not easy to follow for me, you know, especially later stage companies, it's

Not easy to follow for me, you know, especially later stage companies, it's
Not easy to follow for me, you know, especially later stage companies, it's
S Speaker 16:54It's follow the cash, right? Like, does that make sense? And then we understand the pipeline, we understand the market, and you know what parts they can attain. And that's the part, you know, the competitive piece that I think is, is the most interesting. And I think to kind of get comfortable with the opportunity. Sounds good, yeah,

S Speaker 27:08I'm excited to go through it. I'd love, like, when, while we are working in this process, I love to sort of understand as well on how are you thinking about it? What's your decision making process? I guess just in that process, that would be a good learning point for me. Yeah, no
I'm excited to go through it. I'd love, like, when, while we are working in this process, I love to sort of understand as well on how are you thinking about it? What's your decision making process? I guess just in that process, that would be a good learning point for me. Yeah, no

S Speaker 17:19problem. I mean, I can step you through that. To me, it's this one. Aren't the same, but especially later stage opportunities, right? There's only a couple of things that are going to really move the needle. Right? One, is the market big enough, and are they attacking kind of the right category? Right? Is the market growing? And in this case, right now, like video in fleet safety, very nascent categories only around, you know, six to 8% of the market, there's a lot of the market. There's a lot of room for it to expand. So the market is growing. The market itself, the Connect vehicle market, is large, right? So a lot of places for them to attack. And if they get into connected vehicle, the bigger product market, that's a very large market, right? So are they in the right place? And then the team, right? This is the right team to execute. These guys have history of executing. Have done well so far. Main question is, can they keep growing? And, you know, essentially, do, I think, comes to a really solid outcome for you, for a late stage company, it's a series, you know, E Company. So those are the main questions. Everything else is noise and semantics, right? It's, you know, a lot of the devils in the detail. Do they have the right product mix? Do they have the right price points that all kind of comes into the market? So that's, you know, we want to make sure we know that and understand that. But the big questions are, you know, are we in the right segment of the market? Are they addressing those opportunities correctly, right? Do they have a competitive edge to win, you know, to own that part of the market, and can these guys execute and from there on? I think it's pretty simple. Everything else is, like I said, it's, it's detailed, which is, you know, confirmatory. But I don't think it gives you a ton of if someone's bomb is 10% lower, I don't think it kills the story, right?
problem. I mean, I can step you through that. To me, it's this one. Aren't the same, but especially later stage opportunities, right?

S Speaker 28:42I kills the story, right? All the materials you have started working on already, I'll start putting up the competition piece of it, and then once I have a good chunk of research, we'd love to set up another time have a chat through it and see how we are put basically the story. Awesome. Yeah,
