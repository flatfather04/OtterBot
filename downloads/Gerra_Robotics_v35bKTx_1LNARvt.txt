6:04Yeah. So yeah, has
S Speaker 26:09to sign both, you know, particle to work with and towards customers that you think would benefit from what you're doing. Yeah, I generally, I just don't think like VC calls, because it's like, Google's gonna do it. But with Qualcomm specifically, I think, I think there's capacity to scale what we're looking at. Yeah, so to just require us of what we do with farming data, with the largest data being provided outside of mainland China, so only we can buy, like one company in mainland China, but you can't buy data from anywhere. So I'm like, Okay, what we do is we provide a full data set building physical react. So we give you stuff that is required for preteen which includes human POV simulation models you already have sets right to end to end, fine tuning or tell it of RL. So any data set, very factory in the US that you see right now, that is that has any form of like is coming to us. So if you like again, these are customers we work very closely, like coming to one cover Microsoft micro one, which tech team is Microsoft rapid that, or during one of the five big labs that you see is actually harder than visa by to most of them. We're now starting to supply to vertical hardware companies as well. So if you know time to put in ID and cart and Yogi and all these guys to build explicit hardware models, our telephone is recorded now that you bring in right now, bringing in the machines to build up the models and support them in that area backwards. So again, our vantage point, and we've been very lucky that we found the right thing at the right time, and then we're able to scale it. But vantage point has allowed us to, like, really build like, what data is being used. Because I'm sure you talked about these companies, you know, the concern until about recently was that, okay, what did it do? We actually get back? Like, there's like, spring and banging spiral of it, and we just started tested on that. However, I think we've, I mean, who really knows that? But I think we've solidified last year, like one pre training check time. Now it's only a matter of, okay, can it get up, deliver the data to you at that scale, which is what we struggle with, like, that's our next step, like how much scale and how much compute. So I'm sure you've seen that. So even there, they contract to our customers, which is something by saving impacting the data front, but like the data pipeline, where they use the teleop models by DC, if you saw a very silly, I mean, like the day before yesterday, they just put it on Twitter, but they've been working on it for quite a while, where they took the teleoperator to create the first model, which is then taken pure so, like, if you could scale that with POV data, human data, you can put that in the model and then convert that to machine kinematics and then use that to create the model. So that's, that's the way I think report is getting up now. So use the first teleoff set to create, like, the model which converts human data into teleo, and then use the teleop just like, scale it up exponentially.
to sign both, you know, particle to work with and towards customers that you think would benefit from what you're doing. Yeah, I generally, I just don't think like VC calls, because it's like, Google's gonna do it. But with Qualcomm specifically, I think, I think there's capacity to scale what we're looking at.

S Speaker 19:13That's super interesting, or just, and how long have you been around? Like that seems like a lot of traction, a lot of customers in a very short time, right?
That's super interesting, or just, and how long have you been around? Like that seems like a lot of traction, a lot of customers in a very short time, right?
That's super interesting, or just, and how long have you been around? Like that seems like a lot of traction, a lot of customers in a very short time, right?
That's super interesting, or just, and how long have you been around? Like that seems like a lot of traction, a lot of customers in a very short time, right?
S Speaker 29:25again, we were very lucky. I'm not positive, I think. But like we started out actually initially as a human rights we would just, like bring in humans from China and then deploy them with like, popularity, stuff like that. Yes. So that was our code. Actually sold out like that. However, for that, we had to build out a tele platform for ourselves. It was like, how you can actually operate the robot, like a trade show, a hospitality sense, yes, right? So we see, like, literally, like me, like audit, like Brian, all of us, like, we should, like, just take like, human rights and then take them to Vegas, and then push them to, like, expose so they can be pushed through. So we built up the tele platform for that. Fortunately, again, we knew some people at micro one, they were very interested in our data. So we found that, okay, people are not interested in the robot themselves. Find that through capital intensive, but they're very interested in the data, right? We said, okay, you know, we just start up, start that office and find it and POC and we push that up. We found the right customer at that time. And then after that, we were like, Okay, this seems like the place to do it. We scale it up. We now the largest biofuel booster machines. Again, whatever I say, is just outside of mainland China, because I'm tapping them. So I'm going to comment on those things. Largest biofuel boosting machines, if you know, boost robotics, yeah, yeah. One of the largest parts with Linux and unity, our fleet is over 20 operating so which is actually the largest commercial fleet in the US, right? But we have perfect machine in order with which have been deployed. So our current bottleneck, right, frankly, is the ability to scale our dial is we would like to work with a lot more customers, but we are only so many people
again, we were very lucky. I'm not positive, I think.

S Speaker 111:04absolutely understand that. Oh, just Yes, and that's that's a super comprehensive and interesting overview. Or just thanks for that. You mentioned the tele ops platform. How does that look like? Maybe just taking a step back, if you can explain how the tele ops platform looks like today, I
absolutely understand that. Oh, just Yes, and that's that's a super comprehensive and interesting overview. Or just thanks for that. You mentioned the tele ops platform. How does that look like? Maybe just taking a step back, if you can explain how the tele ops platform looks like today, I

S Speaker 211:37So I'm afraid we had a chance to go to our website. But these are some of the code modalities we provide. So we're the only ones that do it. Once again, everything I say is caveat China, but we're the only one that there's nobody in the world that doesn't, and so you can't find something better. Of course, you've seen many companies provide first person TV, but we provide that. It's just like one second. So in pre training is where first person PV is useful if you're doing manipulative. Of course, we provide full body we provide simulation uar data sets as well. Here's just our samples. So this is me. I think I'm blocked in as a customer right now. Let me just pull
So I'm afraid we had a chance to go to our website. But these are some of the code modalities we provide. So we're the only ones that do it.

12:18it up for you. Yeah, okay,
it up for you. Yeah, okay,
it up for you. Yeah, okay,
it up for you. Yeah, okay,
S Speaker 212:23so this is just like one of our customers pipeline, yes, generating over three TV of data a week. I think this is going through. As you can see, we provide. This is a human POV, so not synthetic. This is our simulation pipeline that providing customers. This is our RL teleo, first person, I mean, these are just some of the modalities you're providing. We label the data sets. We take care of it end to end. So what we give you is search quality data. Again, we're very big fans to search the company, the data driven company. Sure you know that, yes, but they focus on this, like providing high quality data for our labs. We want to do the same thing for physical AI. Just want to make sure that that's also, frankly, one of the reasons you're not scale up just like in quantity, we don't believe it's good for our customers if it's provide, you know, like anything to them, hesitate that. We want to make sure that show you the samples get good ones by using the mix machiner. So for instance, if we provide anything to our customers, we make sure that not only have them visualize like what the data is looking like for them, but broken set for what the booking sessions look like, but stuff that you did not get anywhere. So like, for instance, you're going to get, okay, forget getting a Ralt up. You can't get that. But if you want an R with a ladder cloud, it's like, okay, that's just not going to happen. So this is all just like, things that are providing to our customers. Our only goal right now, which is quality and scaling that up.
so this is just like one of our customers pipeline, yes, generating over three TV of data a week. I think this is going through. As you can see, we provide. This is a human POV, so not synthetic.

So like, for instance, you're going to get, okay, forget getting a Ralt up. You can't get that. But if you want an R with a ladder cloud, it's like, okay, that's just not going to happen. So this is all just like, things that are providing to our customers. Our only goal right now, which is quality and scaling that up.
so this is just like one of our customers pipeline, yes, generating over three TV of data a week. I think this is going through. As you can see, we provide. This is a human POV, so not synthetic. This is our simulation pipeline that providing customers. This is our RL teleo, first person, I mean, these are just some of the modalities you're providing. We label the data sets. We take care of it end to end. So what we give you is search quality data. Again, we're very big fans to search the company, the data driven company. Sure you know that, yes, but they focus on this, like providing high quality data for our labs. We want to do the same thing for physical AI. Just want to make sure that that's also, frankly, one of the reasons you're not scale up just like in quantity, we don't believe it's good for our customers if it's provide, you know, like anything to them, hesitate that.

S Speaker 113:41Super interesting. Ojas. And I think you sort of answered my question as well. And how do you differentiate yourself from a lot of these? Tell you off farms. Makes, makes a lot of sense. Why do you see say this, or maybe sort of just staying here for a while? How do some of these customers contract with you. What are their requirements? How do you like between teleops simulating and POV How do you do you get so sort of specific requirements of each of those data sets? How do you define it internally, sure.

S Speaker 214:30I was the only thing I noticed is, when they mentioned earlier, what they're saying is Umi. These are very separate things that like, which booth Did you see again? I remember,

S Speaker 217:08it up, we want, like, request for, like, much, lot of stuff, like, we just simply have the capacity. Yeah, we're not willing to offer like, bad data

S Speaker 117:14to customers totally. Yeah, that's, that's the right business decision, I feel, especially at this stage, or just makes a lot of sense and and where are you in terms of traction? How does this look like today?

S Speaker 217:26Yeah, so we've already booked and by again, I don't mean Silicon Valley numbers. I mean like, what came in the bank. We've booked almost many dollars this year, and we've contracted over four already. I'll go through the next year, just get it up to once again. Who knows what happens? But over 20, I believe is conservatively possible, just, and I'm not taking into account the expression physical depths. All these guys like scaling up, keeping that aside, which I think we select data they're looking at like 20 the coming year.
Yeah, so we've already booked and by again, I don't mean Silicon Valley numbers. I mean like, what came in the bank.

So this is a fraction or, I mean, you
S Speaker 218:11mentioned like founder, let's say, and all those things we made, obviously less noise than other people, but I believe we've been executing, I would say faster, but I believe that we've been executed more faster than anybody else. And the reason I also booked this call right now on Wednesday is because, very frankly, we like in Docs for acquisition for one of our two of our customers, because you can understand, if you're like, large aggregator, right, like you don't want to outsource it, pushing it through. So we've had that Google through the motions and see how we get low ball on that flat section. That's always fun. Yeah, but

S Speaker 118:59how are you thinking about it? Is acquisition on top of your mind for in the near term. Do you think that makes sense, given the offer looks attractive, or do you really want to see the scale?

S Speaker 219:09Yeah. So once again, we did offer this mug to our customers. I can imagine all of their stuff, like the end of December. So we said, okay, which I talked about, if you guys like to see how it goes. That was also the reason we also just scheduled all of our VCA about calls like through the last two weeks. Just want to make sure that, you know, we're getting all of our offers on the table. And once again, the code would like, I did not sell. I think that's just so much work to do. It'd be so nice if you just give that properly. On the other hand, I also understand that. I understand the customer's concerns that were the same that, you know, we don't have our entire arm relax like somebody else. Yeah. Is that true?
Yeah. So once again, we did offer this mug to our customers. I can imagine all of their stuff, like the end of December. So we said, okay, which I talked about, if you guys like to see how it goes.

S Speaker 119:51So 100% yes. Data is so existential for most of these companies that they would have essentially want to build this themselves. But again, an aggregator model is something that works best from an economics point of view. So I get where you position in the entire market. So just again, the question would be, would you be interested, say, or do you plan to have a fundraise sometime soon, given how some of these acquisition discussions go, or what would be the next, say, fundraising milestone and when.

S Speaker 220:37fundraising offers. Brand already works very closely with us. He'll be the CPO through the coming year, through Brother I joined, but we Papa, enhancing him being CPO through Jan, as far as it comes up. And yeah, I mean, like, if you don't go through with this acquisition, which is like right now, feeling overseas, if anybody
fundraising offers. Brand already works very closely with us.

20:59is interested in
S Speaker 221:05scaling it up with us, yeah, so that's why I was just interested in call, because you have the capacity for scale, which somewhat smaller, like we see harms. But of course, these guys are also coming with so taking that, I mean, I don't ask you to refer to anything,
