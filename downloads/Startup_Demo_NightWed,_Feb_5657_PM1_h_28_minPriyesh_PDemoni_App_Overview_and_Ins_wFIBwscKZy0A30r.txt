S Speaker 10:00There, you can give all of that in the demoni app. And at the very end, we are going to be voting on the top intenders. And here's some screenshots of our demoniac app. It's an awesome app. Took a lot of engineering work. All right. Now what I want, all what I want, all of you guys scan that

S Speaker 10:49all right, cool. Okay, so here is how the demo nine app works. First of all, we have the pre demo space so it looks like you guys are looking down your phone, which is good right now, because what you're going to want to do is fill out just your basic information and then click on Update Profile over there, and then later on, during the actual demo phase, you will have the opportunity to leave feedback. Rate the company, save what went well versus what didn't go well. And please leave your honest feedback, because these demos that are coming on stage, this is what they're looking for. So be honest about what you like what you didn't like. And there's also like, you can leave a clap emoji. On the right, there's like, I want to work for you. I want to invest in you, etc. On the left, you see, like a on the bottom left, email me. There's a lot of options that you can click on over there. And then afterwards, after all eight are done, we are going to vote, and the three categories are going to be best overall, best technology and

Feel free to scan that QR code over there, or reach out to one of the organizing members like me or chappy, and you can get involved in the engineering. And actually, I was just curious, maybe by a show of hands, to see the breakdown of the audience who here is, say, a founder, raise your hand. Wow, impressive. Okay, who here is an engineer or an operator?

S Speaker 24:41Time is our most precious resource yet. Every day we spend a ton of time in email, and this means your Monday morning coffee is going to get cold before you go through a bullet letter and inbox that's doing it for you, and we're taking a new approach to tapping that problem. Instead of thinking about your email and your list of correspondences. We're using it as a platform to save information and decouple that from the way we present it. So check out this first one. So

S Speaker 27:56sender for the people in the back. I can open it up, but basically what it just did was it found all of the emails from the Okay, all the emails from that sender. Selected it all so that you can all move them in one button into the folder you want to get it to again. Even though we took a large group action, it would be nice if I didn't have to find all of these noisy senders everywhere, and actually just grab them all from the newsletters category and select all of them and create a rule for every one of the newsletter senders to move into a newsletter bucket. What just happened is like silence from your inbox, but at a high level, what we want to achieve is turn the world into something that looks a lot more like tailored experiences for every context, whether it's travel newsletters or any other modality that you use. That's a problem. Let's give a couple questions. Do you have some

S Speaker 39:02questions we've got about two minutes of questions. First of all, I just kind of, what I see was an inbox that's really nicely designed that allows you to take batch actions. These are things you've already doing in Gmail. These are things you can do in other email clients, like superhuman like, what? What is the thing that you feel is like, the most unique about

S Speaker 29:25that we've had a hard time answering the competition question. But even when you say, these apps allow you to do that. Gmail, mobile app right now doesn't allow you to create a folder. Today, the app that you use for the service and superhuman doesn't have a rule, creation, organize or call to action. You can sort of search, search, select all and move, but not a one button kind of attempt. But at a high level, we're not even competing with these people. We're trying to do separate information story from information presentation. So understand the details about the email structure and give you a personal graph that you can take action.

S Speaker 511:00Well, for me, email often has themes that come about and it's dynamic. And I wasn't sure for sure that you're doing this, but it sounds like you have a system that identifies those themes over time automatically, rather than requiring me to come up with sub folders and organize myself

S Speaker 211:22Exactly. So we have to start somewhere. So we try to find the most effective way to clear your inbox, not just hide it from your field of view, so that even after we've piled condensed and efficiently presented information from a bunch of emails, you now have it clear by moving into their types, categories and topics and very modifiable

S Speaker 212:39funny story is like this, there should be a couple more of those kind of bumps. I launched a password manager. My friends got excited and like, almost blew up, and then we killed it. And then it wasn't really a Tech Crunch one. Then I started a local, first discord community. But this is about people passionate about user ownership of data. The app I showed you has no databases, no servers. We're trying to do all the AI locally. Then that grew to 3300 developers. But then when we launched the app to that community, it was dead again. So I think we're like right there,

So you hit clone, pick the new models, model that's come out, and it start new trading talk. So we update models within about 24 hours of a new model release. You can actually fine tune deep seated already, and you can fine tune light, deep sleep on an series. So you can do you can do prbos that you lost function on the platform as well.

S Speaker 421:13Yes. So that's a really great question. We get this all the time. If you look at something like a fireworks together, they're fine tuning infrastructure. Our big focus is that we're fine tuning intuition present structure. What that means is we actually make quite a few opinionated decisions across the board, right? So we're not going to leave it up to you. You can override all of our decisions, but by default, we'll tell you which GPU instance to go to, so you don't have an outline together. If you decide that you're actually doing a classification task, we change the last function for you, again, all in your control. You can override you can change the training script. It's alright, but if you're trying to do things that you might not be able to do right away or might take a lot of time to set up, we already have them in this. So our portfolio is really to deliver intuition through this knowledge to sell this.

S Speaker 422:17exactly? So, what we're basically getting is we're doing some years of ml engineering experience and putting it into the platform. So if you have an error, we can start going and predicting why you're having this error, so you can arrive at the optimal model for your task a lot faster. So it's not just, Hey, why don't you come here and find something that's easy? It's we're going to try and prevent as many failure modes as possible so that you can get your optimal model a lot faster than you would if you were just brute forcing, which is kind of what all of machine learning is about.

So I understand from if I'm working as an engineer, as a team, is essentially right, but if I think as a business, the problem you're trying to solve is me, ml engineers of less tedious, essentially, right? But you
Yeah, do Hey, so Dean, nice. I work as a machine learning engineer for last four, five years.

S Speaker 423:37So really, because one of the things that we're constantly focused on is, how much does your AI engineer need to know? So there's a spectrum from software engineer to AI engineer to machine learning engineer, right? And you're usually trading up on product sense, like the closer you get to software, the more product native they are. We're trading down on some sort of capital sense, if you think about it that way. And so what we want to keep doing is trying and making all of these capabilities more and more accessible to people that might have less of a math background and more of a product background when it comes to machine learning engineers, one of the ways reasons that heads of heads of AI really like giving us on board is because of the collaboration features so You can use sagemaker, but sagemaker has almost no capability for multiple engineers to collaborate with each other. The other big thing is, we actually incline compute and data infrastructure. If you look at something like AWS, there's storage and there's but machine learning engineering is some environment with storage and compute. And so what really saying is, look, your abstraction is now trained job. Your abstraction is not modeled dumped in some s3 bucket. We'll make sure we index those things you focus on how to get that optimal training job in place. Every team has an ML engineer shortage. I've never met a company that has as many other engineers they wish they had. And so we basically make their three ml engineers feel like that.

S Speaker 327:39there are a lot of companies that do versions of interactive demos for sales, like, a lot of beauty SaaS. But are like, Are there any companies that focus on selling developer tools?

S Speaker 1228:09Yeah, this is a brand new so I'm gonna show you guys two workflows. The first is the operating workflow. So it's like if you're a sales or a market person, and then the second, I'll show you the delivery workflow. So here at developer.

building a dental and TypeScript, yep, and
S Speaker 1228:43what it will do. So if you guys have ever used like jasper.ai for writing blog posts, this is kind of like that, but it's net for technical products. So the workspace the output is actually both. So the first prompt is asking if you have, like, a transcript from Google up for a customer discovery call. This gives the AI some context about what the customer use cases. This asks for URL to a database schema if you have that so we can use to generate synthetic data. This is for including integrations. And then, for example, this, is like allows you to specify like through the audience, instead of like software engineer or healthcare, and then it will generate the code. And I'll pivot over to show you guys how a customer will experience this. So, so this is actually a demo from the lake for design partner. They are a VS code exception, and one of the problems they have is they have issues where people have super version of VS code that doesn't is supported. They need a specific version of node installed. And so with actually just a single click when you refresh those hashtag live demo. So with this click of a button, it is going to actually do the entire setup. So this is actually going to install VS code exception, you'll see that this populated on the left side here. So the company is called poly API. It's going to ask me to type in an API key in just a second.
what it will do. So if you guys have ever used like jasper.ai for writing blog posts, this is kind of like that, but it's net for technical products. So the workspace the output is actually both.

30:33So is this what the
S Speaker 1230:35this is a developer trying to evaluate, like whether they will use poly API or not. And so yeah, these buttons actually manipulate the VS code. So this is actually the part where this is really cool for sales engineer, because they can build this demo experience as if they were on the call, but now the customer is self serving the buttons.

So here, what are some of the buttons there.
So here, what are some of the buttons there.
So here, what are some of the buttons there.
S Speaker 1231:02So the first, the first is run the setup. So this installs the VS code exception and runs the poly asset, because this is a very frustrating the second generates their SDK, which actually builds like the knowledge graph of like which APIs it understands. And then you can basically ask the AI to generate some code for you. So

S Speaker 1231:33this is not our product, by the way, this is like our customer's product, like the workspace is ours, but the code extension is our customer, and then whatever code it generates, here you can click this button to open the file to type in. So you can so this button may open this file and copy and paste this COVID and run
this is not our product, by the way, this is like our customer's product, like the workspace is ours, but the code extension is our customer, and then whatever code it generates, here you can click this button to open the file to type in.

One of the cool things too is this infrastructure allows us to connect to, like, third party integration, so we can connect to databases, we can connect to we even have, like AWS services simulation. We can obviously generate data. We can pull data for production, if that is allowable. So it's really flexible. Are you seeing people use it for prototyping? So far, we're targeting, so we're pre launch, so we're targeting our pre sales and post sales uses.

And that's kind of the point, like, you want to make the sale, and then you can kind of figure out the implementation afterwards. I think what we're really trying to sell like the value prop is really like, anytime that a customer tries your product and has friction in the setup, you're going to see drop off in the conversion, right? And so this is providing a frictionless way for people to actually experience your product, and then you can figure out all the messy, real world things that happen to sell

S Speaker 1537:42So these are games where every pixel of every frame is generated with AI. So instead of using the game engine, which has 3d assets and code staging it all together, you use a video model. It's a visual diffusion transformer, and you generate every subsequent frame based on the previous few frames and buttons video pressing along the way locally, you can get about 20 frames a second on the latest in the hardware. Let's see it. Yeah, sure,

S Speaker 1438:11yeah. I mean, we've got a demo here. I was in the industry the past six years. I didn't actually want to founding gaming, but this new technology that advanced over the past six months dragged me back in. I think that it heralds a new generation of games where you can prompt the world into being personalized gameplay, and users can return and change these worlds on the fly. I think super exciting. But here's what we've done.

S Speaker 1538:34Yeah, so this is all really, really good timeline. So far, we've made an open source platform where you can easily, on Linux and on Windows, find and play these generated games just by clicking it and downloading it. You may see AI Minecraft around. You can play Descartes model. Here you were showing a model called lucid, also Minecraft. It's bit more performative in machines. And as you can see, it looks like Minecraft, but it's not really Minecraft. It's very technically a hallucination of Minecraft. So you look one way, you turn it around, and everything looks completely different. We believe this isn't a book. This is indeed the major

S Speaker 1439:11Yeah. So part of our next focus is making these more and more stateful and allowing users to interact with them. We'll show another game that we have. This is created by a solar demo on very car. So one of the interesting things here is the mini map there actually provides some kind of memory in state. We also allow on our platform to change the denois step. So if you want it to be more accurate but slower on your on your homeland, then you can do that.

S Speaker 1539:43I really do want to call attention to the minimap. This model has four frames of memory, so when you're going around the circuit, it looks the same. It didn't have the minimap, it would just move forever. But the minimap, the dot, keeps moving. It's the only thing that still keeps it on track. What's the interaction like right now? Yeah, actually, now is whatever you condition the actions on. So here you can just, you can turn left and right, you can use the mushroom, and that's about it. But what we're really excited about is novel interaction methods, like, for example, being able to prompt a house and feeding in Minecraft, we have a vision, for example, for streamers and their audiences interacting with this. So students play the game, and the ideas can prompt things to change in the game.

S Speaker 1440:24Yeah? Well, they're just going to spirit the stream. They don't have to kill them. That's the first use game policy. Yeah. And we have one more model that we want to show, which we train ourselves, which is a walking simulator. You're going through this green lights Trumps like game.

S Speaker 1540:44We're really excited about being able to create these roles and switch them together. So you walk through a door in one world and you show up in a different game, so the humans can then create experiences and send a message to have the narrative that tell the story.

S Speaker 1441:45Funniest thing is just watching people play with these models and seeing what they find fun. So the Minecraft model, you see people speed wrong. They look at certain pixels, and it's almost a measure of the game, but you try and teleport to them ever so now again, we're playing fine with these models. It will be interesting to see what happens when say you're able to push and move things around. You're able to prompt them. But we can't say too much more

So with robots, you're able to create games, but if you're using lower like low code solutions, this should allow anybody to prompt and write it. Might want to create a sci fi universe and then for that game or to be instantiated. I think there's also really interesting elements of co creation, where people can have 1000 people are able to enter into these worlds and remix them. So a similar revolution to what happened with video might have found them on this premise will happen with games

So here we can see, instead of giving sensitive data, so we give like it just says phone number, so you can still get all the, all the all the utility that you would normally want to get out of it. But as Ilya showed there, because we know what they all are on the on the browser, we can actually just swap it on this side. So what's going to chat? GPT, are those masks. But the way that we can display it, because you've already typed it in, we can show it to you as if you're just using it normally. So this basically allows you to use tools like chatgpt Without giving away the sensitive data to the bar, to retain that on your side, and so you get this very seamless user experience. Again, we also do this for images, and if you want to see a pretty cool demo where we have computer use remote computer use agent, controlling your computer, sending screenshots that are adaptive back, we can now enjoy that as well.

You can do anything. So you can define whatever you like, and it will spot it in tech. So it's really very intelligent, but to understand me, but you're looking for part numbers, IP addresses, API keys, trade secrets, project names, whatever it might be, it. Will it work here?

Do you know what open operator is not great. So what we do is we are a safety layer on top of that. So if you want to just use open air operator, it's going to click on some button, which is really, really bad. Or if you have a workload that needs to be executed 50,000 times, and you want to make it reliable, we are the safety layer and reliable layer on top of that, where we can host this agent and make it improve over time.

Don't worry. So we're going to kick off an agent which is going to use a browser to go to HubSpot, sign into our HubSpot account, extract some information about our right clients, and fill in seven insurance quotes on different websites for them to go ahead and type in my class, give it seven websites and give it instructions as to Global Institute. Going to go ahead and kick off this agent. So let's go have a look at this agent running live in the browser. So this is not me controlling this browser. This is the agent. Immediately, of course, it's been faced with a login screen, and we've told this agent we have a number of safety checks, and one of them is, if you're in front of a login screen, escalate a human. The first time we see this, we're going to log in. So I'm going to take control of this browser as a human. I'm going to log in with my credentials. Skip this step. The AI now has control of their element. We resume the execution. You can see it take control and start to execute on its task. So it's getting the credentials from for this user. It

The first time we see this, we're going to log in. So I'm going to take control of this browser as a human. I'm going to log in with my credentials. Skip this step. The AI now has control of their element. We resume the execution. You can see it take control and start to execute on its task. So it's getting the credentials from for this user. It
once. But for this demo, we're going to kick something off just in UI, a single agent. No, okay, so hopefully you guys can see on the right side, I'll explain really clearly. Don't worry. So we're going to kick off an agent which is going to use a browser to go to HubSpot, sign into our HubSpot account, extract some information about our right clients, and fill in seven insurance quotes on different websites for them to go ahead and type in my class, give it seven websites and give it instructions as to Global Institute. Going to go ahead and kick off this agent. So let's go have a look at this agent running live in the browser. So this is not me controlling this browser. This is the agent.

is extracting more information and
is extracting more information and
is extracting more information and
S Speaker 1059:18eventually will give us the data that we need. Now this will get accessible. So now we want to use this information to fill in seven insurance forms, which might have 80 steps in each this can take a human an hour to do, or we can just do it using our radio. So we've filled in these seven forms in a matter of minutes
eventually will give us the data that we need. Now this will get accessible. So now we want to use this information to fill in seven insurance forms, which might have 80 steps in each this can take a human an hour to do, or we can just do it using our radio.

S Speaker 1059:42So this is another agent cycle. It has gone to this website, taken the details and run a 21 step process to find a quote for this to this person. This happened asynchronously. This this quote has now been extracted, and we have six other of

S Speaker 101:00:06going to see the prompt that was used for this agent, which we could iterate on and improve. We can go ahead and look at the progress, see what the agent did, check the output, and if we want to give feedback here for the agent, the agent the next time that it runs the next time that it runs it when you use the update. So hopefully you understood what it is that we do.

S Speaker 31:00:34Yeah. So this is really this type of automation is like, super, super horizontal, if you use it, you should have, like an insurance use case. What other what other use cases are you seeing or

S Speaker 191:00:46hoping to see? Yeah, so we see the biggest use cases in some kind of form when you need to automate interaction with some portal that doesn't have an API. So in this case, we have insurance use case when there are 20 portals, but they want to use hundreds of portals, and it's impossible to open API, but if AI agents, you can finally do this. So if you have, for example, have a CRM, so HR use case where you have manual data entry, that's another use case. We have 50,000 data entry points that you need to do every day. You can automate it now with AI agents, but it hasn't been possible because they're like narrow problems and like many edge cases. So you kind of use like Selenium or playwrights script, which is the state of the art of automation right now.
hoping to see? Yeah, so we see the biggest use cases in some kind of form when you need to automate interaction with some portal that doesn't have an API.

S Speaker 191:02:38yes, and the point of hosting it is that we can improve every execution. So you saw, for example, there was human feedback, and every time we were able to get rid of this data point, we can improve and like, if the website is going to change, we can detect those kind of things, and we just end to end automated workflow. You don't have to worry about it.

This whole army of consultants come in who set up the software for them. So we're building agents to replace these on your consultants. This is basically what Accenture, PwC, Deloitte, a bunch of these companies

do. It's huge industry.
do. It's huge industry.
do. It's huge industry.
S Speaker 211:05:52Yeah, sure. So let's get started the first step. Yeah. So as I was saying, companies do one of two things. They work with these expensive consultants who charge by the hour and often don't have enough business contacts to do a good enough job. Or they'll hire again, expensive in house admins, which ratio will be super smooth. There'll be one admin for like, a 600% or so. While we understood this, we realized that an agent for implementing Salesforce might be a good idea. This app works. You connect to Salesforce to give us some details, and you get access to the dashboard. So good way to think of the dashboard is essentially a place which is down here. Requirements, whatever you want Salesforce to do. I want salesforce automation to be rated. I want a flow. I want a custom object. I want a custom report dashboard. You just put it out there. And then there are three things, categories of tickets. There's active completed interview. So let's go ahead assign a new ticket to the agent. So I'm going to take a particular example where we create a new record time. What that means in Salesforce is think of it as an object where I'll be storing all of the data about leads that I'm getting from a partner of my business. So the ticket has all of some some additional details about what needs to be implemented. What does the lookup relationship of the database schema look like? What does the page layout in Salesforce supposed to look like, etc. Just go ahead and click Submit Now, and it gets logged now, let's ask the agent to actually execute this. So I go ahead and click on execute. Now, while that's going on, let me explain to you what's going on in the background. So everything that a consultant does on Salesforce, which is click, click, click, can be represented, or is represented in Salesforce in the form of XML data. Now llms are good at generating code. So what's going on here is llms Understanding the requirement, understanding what code needs to be generated, which is XML, and come back with the code. So the first step is this planning agent, which is essentially the agent coming up with, like, a broad plan that, okay, if you want this to be done, this is what I'm going to do. You'll see it on the screen in a second, and there's a human in the loop element all throughout. So nothing gets implemented that you don't that's undesirable. It asks you. So just as you see there, it's asking me, Are you okay with that plan? I'm like, Yes, proceed. Then the business and this agent comes in. These are, these are complicated tasks, right? The agent needs to have all of the context. So it's going to ask, it's going to determine if it has all the context. It's going to pull all of the context from Salesforce, pass it on to the architect agent. The architect agent comes up with a technical blueprint, high level overview, passes that command to the developer agent. Before that, again, you don't need to do it's going to ask you if the architecture, some of it, is good enough. If you say it's, yeah, okay, good enough. Confirm. Then the developer agent comes in. Now this is where the magic happens. Remember, I was talking about the XML code generation. That's what the developer agent comes to make. It's generating code. It's identifying what files need to be edited, what code needs to be put in. And, yeah, that's about it. Implementation simply. The final step, as you see on screen, is testing just to ensure that what's been implemented is what is desired, and then the tickets gets
Yeah, sure. So let's get started the first step. Yeah. So as I was saying, companies do one of two things. They work with these expensive consultants who charge by the hour and often don't have enough business contacts to do a good enough job.

What that means in Salesforce is think of it as an object where I'll be storing all of the data about leads that I'm getting from a partner of my business. So the ticket has all of some some additional details about what needs to be implemented. What does the lookup relationship of the database schema look like? What does the page layout in Salesforce supposed to look like, etc. Just go ahead and click Submit Now, and it gets logged now, let's ask the agent to actually execute this. So I go ahead and click on execute. Now, while that's going on, let me explain to you what's going on in the background. So everything that a consultant does on Salesforce, which is click, click, click, can be represented, or is represented in Salesforce in the form of XML data. Now llms are good at generating code. So what's going on here is llms Understanding the requirement, understanding what code needs to be generated, which is XML, and come back with the code. So the first step is this planning agent, which is essentially the agent coming up with, like, a broad plan that, okay, if you want this to be done, this is what I'm going to do. You'll see it on the screen in a second, and there's a human in the loop element all throughout. So nothing gets implemented that you don't that's undesirable. It asks you. So just as you see there, it's asking me, Are you okay with that plan? I'm like, Yes, proceed. Then the business and this agent comes in. These are, these are complicated tasks, right? The agent needs to have all of the context. So it's going to ask, it's going to determine if it has all the context. It's going to pull all of the context from Salesforce, pass it on to the architect agent. The architect agent comes up with a technical blueprint, high level overview, passes that command to the developer agent. Before that, again, you don't need to do it's going to ask you if the architecture, some of it, is good enough. If you say it's, yeah, okay, good enough. Confirm. Then the developer agent comes in. Now this is where the magic happens. Remember, I was talking about the XML code generation. That's what the developer agent comes to make. It's generating code. It's identifying what files need to be edited, what code needs to be put in. And, yeah, that's about it. Implementation simply. The final step, as you see on screen, is testing just to ensure that what's been implemented is what is desired, and then the tickets gets

S Speaker 31:10:00use it there. There are a lot of different steps in different ages. My guess would be an error in one step propagates to all the other steps. Yeah. Like, how do you

S Speaker 211:10:11so the good part about this is the actual execution comes up in just the developer agent, so at any point in time, that's why there's strongly limited loop on the steps before the up agent. So let's say it's come up with an error that you don't want you can stop it right then you can give it some extra instructions so that all those errors get mitigated and then develop agent ensures that the correct context is pulled and the correct XML is generated depending on all those

That's what we're going for. And as I mentioned, right, like this is for demo purposes, but in real life, our customers usually just ask for it to have it on Slack, or they'll ask for it to have it on JIRA.

S Speaker 211:12:02yeah, I feel like I should just keep this answer here at this point, with everyone asking that. But yeah, so agent force particularly is more focused on end using use cases. So let's say I'm a salesperson. I want an AI CR for to boost network activity, then agent force comes in. So a good way to think about everything that Salesforce comes up with is builder. So Salesforce is not SaaS. It's SaaS builder. You come in with these consultants, and you use the SaaS builder to build SaaS for you, just like that. If you see agent force builder, it's an agent builder. Somebody still has to come in and build agents on that. Agent builder, having said that, yes, it's still very promising. And actually, just 10 days ago, they launched something, but our guests, or our hope, our destined hope, could be that they always do 10% of it, like just with DevOps, Salesforce.

S Speaker 221:16:52compressing models for? Also anything popular has anyone dealt with in media? GPUs here, Intel CPUs, AMD CPUs, raspberry pies, those are our targets. So mobile phones, it's like, how do you take that model so you can put it into a device, make that application come to life, but also maybe get some benefit on cloud. So whether you're all about expanding your user experience. Users wants fast responses, or some companies want to save a lot of money, because some use cases that we have is, instead of paying for a long weighted 800 machine, can you just use l4 GPU?

S Speaker 221:17:54Yeah, so that's pretty much an open problem. There are so many stuff you can do. So the idea is, once you take a model, all these fancy AI models that you keep caring about, just neural networks, basically dumbing it down. Neural networks, graphs, nodes, edges, that's the problem you're trying to solve. Every node, every pattern, everywhere. You can just mash them up together and take advantage of running it faster.

It's either they're not moving as fast or the things are not well supported for all the models. So what happens is you put in something, and then it just doesn't work, and then engineers spend six to 12 months just trying to get the damn thing running on the device, and that's a vicious cycle that doesn't and something is not supported. You're trying it again. Now, add a different model. Go back to the beginning. Add a different hardware. Go back to the beginning. Start figuring this part out, and maybe you just end up on a community forum trying to figure this model, which is very, very common.

S Speaker 221:19:46So let me zoom out. This is all the code you need to compress all of the yellow models. So basically, what happens here? First of all, we want to run on a sensor. RT, that's by Nvidia. You can either go for Intel platform, either on this one time, Qualcomm and PDB, click on basically all of the amount of fonts that you keep hearing of. This is a very, very efficient way of doing this for any hard work, just once. You just take eight images, initialize the model and call this magic function. So what you can see happening is, in less than a minute, we'll have the first yellow model, and that would be pretty much like minus eight. And so 10 minutes will happen. And that also applies to Lama or whisper or any of the board division models, basically entire hockey space can be done

S Speaker 231:21:36Sorry, like my co founder, like for the really important part that, like our automated compression toolkit automatically compresses your customized model on average 7% and accelerate with the speed on average six times for any target hardware that you're aiming for. And our compression engine is next level, instead of just composing, like a model, like from 32 bit to eight, bit four bit now, like our operated version, like outputs the mixed precision we do, like automated sensitivity, like analysis per layer, so we automatically output the most optimal state of the model. Thank you. Thank you.

S Speaker 241:22:30is like a bunch of students, which you can just use of the child promoting professional. What I prefer to understand is that if the value proposition is like arbitrary model, so like arbitrary hardware, how are you focused on, like, automatically generates, like COVID or specialized hardware? Like, is that something like just writing, like cola code, which is better than what exists out there? Is that potential you're looking at, or is it mostly about model compression?

S Speaker 221:22:59So model compression is not our end target. This is milestone now for us. So we're already doing like sub four bits quantization right now. We're blocked by the inferencing frameworks. So all the tensor RT given, tensor RT, LLM, which is great, but very heavily template based. There's openvino, there's only runtime to an end. So easy inference frameworks, they're blocking us from doing even crazier stuff. So that would be our next phase of going into more of the runtime and owning the runtime. And then what you're saying, so to the point that we would generate kernels for you, so you can have one single CDT file that you can just compile, run it wherever you want, compile it on your system, do whatever you want. So that's the next thing. So conquering this was key, because pretty much, like you maybe find, like a very niche project on GitHub that show you one bit matrix multiplication, but in reality, it's not being used. And also, very heavily, we need to find the model. We don't do that automatic. Put the model in. You can set the wide range of bits you want to try if there's something you want, super tweakable sliders. All
