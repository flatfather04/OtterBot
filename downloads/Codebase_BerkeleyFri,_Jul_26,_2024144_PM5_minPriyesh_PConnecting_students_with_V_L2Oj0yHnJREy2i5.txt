5:29So I'm happy to do right after this I'll send over an email with that two pager that has those resumes and then in terms of what kind of like comp or what kind of you know engagement it would be for each student working I would say I'll send over some details or maybe company that's doing interesting things. Sounds good. So the way I'm looking at it right now are of is that Qualcomm and just here would be positioned more as just the connector. Once we make those connections. It is between the student and the company themselves to discuss about the project, the compensation and everything else. Would there be any sort of commitments on our end? No, I don't think it would be anything that you would have to do my, I guess maybe one thing would maybe be this is a value add as an investor to the company's meaning. Whatever partners have invested in these companies can say that enhances the profile the investors in some way, but in terms of in somewhat but in terms of like nothing nothing required if you will yes certainly I understand that that's would be a part of the pitch but on your end does call value for you? That makes sense. That would be an easiest thing for sure. How are you planning to structure the entire program? Are you targeting multiple? So said well done, then that would be great. project or make that A value for you. That makes sense. That would be an easier sell for sure how. remember he during the last two years I was trying partly successful and it made a lot of sense to get people like students connected to VC firms. Is that Bob on then that would be great It would be. a great trial run as well meaning we'd run it for one year if it's working great then we can you know continue on in the future see how we can even build it out even more but right now I think it would just be a great trial program to see it Give me a couple of profiles any short intro about codebase any background and historical achievements so I appreciate you also taking this internally and making. the sale so I really do appreciate that for sure for sure I remember during the last two years I was trying to create a program around this we were partly successful and it may a lot of sense to get people like students connected to VC firms
