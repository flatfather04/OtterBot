S Speaker 20:18All right, so I heard about creating on a Tiktok ad. I was scrolling through Tiktok and I was looking for solutions for my business, because obviously doing photoshoots with models can be quite costly. And I stumbled upon creating with an ad, and I was really impressed by what it could do. So then I got the yearly payment from starting January this year.

S Speaker 22:09I generate, I generate videos with pretty at least twice. I make three, three, a batch of three videos, two, two batches of three videos. So, three videos, one batch, and then three again. And I mostly use the try on feature. That's the feature we use the most, because it's also the one that takes the list time, and it's the best for my business. You know, we all, we always done photo ads, so that's what I like the most.

S Speaker 22:49Yeah, yes, I do have professionals, and I have myself too, and I know how to use videos, but creative, pretty basically does most of the job. All you need to do sometimes, maybe, like, you know, I just did the length of the video, but creative basically does everything that we need, so I don't rely on the professionals more.

S Speaker 23:24So, from so last year, I used to make about 5000 to 6000 and out of that 6000 I would make. I would spend 1200 1500 on photo shoots, and I would add, sometimes $1,000 or $1,200 for ads. And you know, it would cost me so much money, my net profit would be about 1000 1500 but ever since I started using crazy, I spend less on those photo shoots, so my net profit has increased. Not only just that, he has increased to 10,000 why? Because I've been able to spend more on ads because I have a bigger budget. Now, since, since I don't need to do as many photo shoots, since I have the app.

4:50Well, I do believe
S Speaker 24:52that we could have more templates. I do believe you could have more varieties. I do believe the app can even do more than it already has. But as for now, I think. The app has been very well done. You know, I was, I'm still surprised, as for now, as to to know like, AI is able to do this. You know, five years ago, I could never even imagine AI could do this. And, yeah, I hope there can be more templates for for the app, because this has been my go to app. It saves me so much time and so much money. So as I run more ads, if there can be more templates that will go also with my clientele, my target consumers, that would that would be better for me, as I'll be able to make more videos. And honestly, the app is so great that if he has all those templates, I'll be willing
that we could have more templates. I do believe you could have more varieties. I do believe the app can even do more than it already has. But as for now, I think. The app has been very well done.

S Speaker 25:47of of apps. You know, out there, a lot of apps try to do the same thing created does, but when you use them, it's not the same quality. You don't have the same return, you don't have the same results. So some of those apps, I would have them downloaded, and after just a day, I delete them because they're not as good. And crazy has been the one app I've used the most. Literally, there's no other app I have on my phone other than crazy and also sometimes photo room, but crazy is the one I focus myself on

S Speaker 26:39yeah, yes. So my KPIs, as you mentioned, I use CTR and I and I use also my conversion rate, my conversion per per action, CPA. So then I've noticed that with creating, even though, you know, I'm using AI, I'm having the same ROI. So my ROI is basically the same. Usually it should drop, you know, since it's it's not a human it's not a human being, it should drop, but it's the same, and that's so good for me because I'm getting the same ROI, but I'm making more money because I'm spending less. So I'm I'm saving so much money because I don't need to use humans. I don't need to to pay professionals. I don't need to pay any models. I don't need to pay any photographer to record videos. So yeah, and it enables me to create more ads, since I don't spend as much money.
