S Speaker 10:00Cool. So our next presenter is represents her to answer some questions about what you need to ask yourself before you start investing in human robotics. So please give a warm round of applause to Christian. Thank you very much.

S Speaker 26:32you look about the regions, you can look about India, China and Japan, the percentage is way higher. I think that the trust in human needs in those regions is way higher than compared to Europe and in North America. So there is a question, the technology will be the same across the world. So there is no difference of technologies, but there is a difference of culture, understanding and perception of other technologies, manufacturing, warehousing is truly the place where we see short term opportunities, but the question will be use cases, and I will get to answer about this question about how to truly start fighting this. I will be honest, cargiving, customer services, it is not where we see the highest appetite and where we see the strongest potential for the short term. We have been working with other clients. Again, it is not where we have the highest numbers of demands. And I started to work on human weeds exactly 12 years ago, on the paper robot from Alta Maran of some bank. For those that I remember, it was the white robot. It was a kind of robot for customer services. It has been used to create some branding, some marketing campaigns, but didn't scale. I think today we are truly in a new technology that could be scaling in those domains, but as soon as you start deploying a robot in an uncontrolled environment with untrained people, you increase the risk of failing. And I think that's in warehousing and manufacturing. We are totally controlled of the render environment, and we can have trend resources. So that's the reason why those other uses will be quite more challenging for the scale of human waste. The second question is, what is the expected return on investment? So it is very complex question, and the reason it is a very complex question is because, in my opinion, and what we see from Accenture, is out three vectors of calculating, the ROI and the value case about human means, there is a pure financial dimension. Okay, I have three clients. They start calculating. I have 10 people working in my warehouse. I put 10 human means. So it is a very simplistic way of maybe making the calculations, but it gives a financial way of calculating what would be the ROI of your human use. Nonetheless, nonetheless today, human weights couldn't be just just a labor cost calculation. There is, of course, a dimension that could go beyond further. Robot would be decreasing. There will be a financial equation that would make the robot way more competitive at a point and will truly drive some financial positive impact. But there is not financial dimension. So the way that the robot are going to improve the quality, to increase the productivity managing more complex task, potentially that the human couldn't get to deal in terms of efficiencies. So there is a non financial dimension that has to be integrated. Lately, when we are making the calculation about the value of those use cases, we integrate the dimension about the long term transformation all our clients are going to transform by adopting physical health. They have certainly a journey that could be 510, 15 years, depending of the industry, they have to start looking about how they're going to transform. And human weed is already starting to stress existing operations when they are already dealing with AMRs and they're failing to scale AMRs, they know that the system was not going to work for this new form of robots. So this is an important way. We have been developing some solution with MIT to directly run some calculation about the business case of adapting robotics and more importantly, human wings. And we have been running some business circulation, looking about what is the percentage of automation we could address, and then calculating what will be the ROI of those emerging technologies. So now the question is, how to select the good hardware, and that is the 10 million the last questions, because we have this question happening very frequently today, I think that's a three dimension we have to explore because our lot of humanoid vendors. And I'm very sorry for if this picture is not up to date, I feel sometimes we have a new human meat company per week, and of course, it is very intensive, entertaining as inventory we have today, a huge directory, with all the humanoid vendors, with all the technical capabilities, but three dimensions. First, there is hardware question, the form factor. We have seen humanoid just before. I think that they have a very exciting form factor. There are some other robots that are more not the catwalk version, because I know that it doesn't make cyclic the CEO, but I think that there is this very human looking human weed. There is others that are very small and very nice for entertainment. So there is clearly a question about the form factor that will be critical. Suddenly, there is beyond hardware. Don't just look about what the robot looks like. Don't look about just the payloads. You need to have a validation that you can control the human read, that you can train the AI of the human read, and you can integrate the human read in your existing system. So looking about purely the hardware is the biggest error, in my opinion. The third point is you will not have just one single human read in your company. There will be lot of human reads. I mean, look about this. You will have maybe one that is more for dexterity, so more that are more for EV charge and lifting. So there will be not just one single human read per industry or per company. There will be multiple human read depending upon the task and the capability. And obviously, I don't think that there is today one single use case killing use case for human needs. I think that the beauty of the human needs is a versatility of the capabilities that the robot can offer. So now there is the first question. The first question is how to integrate human needs in the processes and in the operation. It is a critical point as well about how you are going to go to the scale. We are looking about a lot of pilots, but the scale is critical to make sure that the robot is going to operate in an efficient way. So today, we are recommending to be starting digital twin simulation, but the physical simulation, I mean having truly a space where you can test out use cases, testing out how the robots are going to operate, and making sure that you can measure the efficiency of your human weights. So I would like to start by presenting one project that we delivered recently that is not human we led, but you will understand the logic about how we are going to transform workforce operation for client understanding about how humanoid are going to step in this journey. So just a short video of two minutes with our clients. Kim,

S Speaker 313:45you professional services and Nvidia are bringing physical AI to the $1 trillion warehouse and distribution center market managing high performance warehouse logistics involves navigating a complex web of decisions influenced by constantly shifting variables. These include daily and seasonal demand changes, space constraints, workforce availability and the integration of diverse robotic and automated systems. And predicting operational KPIs of a physical warehouse is nearly impossible today to tackle these challenges, Keon is adopting mega an NVIDIA Omniverse blueprint for building industrial digital twins to test and optimize robotic fleets. First, keon's Warehouse Management Solution assigns tasks to the industrial AI brains in the digital twin such as moving a load from a buffer location to a shuttle storage solution, the robot's brains are in a simulation of a physical warehouse, digitalized into Omniverse using open USD connectors to aggregate CAD video and image to 3d LIDAR to point cloud and AI generated data the fleet of robots execute tasks by perceiving and reasoning about their Omniverse digital twin environment, planning their next motion and acting. The robot brains can see the resulting state through sensor simulations and decide their next action, the loop continues while mega precisely tracks the state of everything in the digital twin now Kion can simulate infinite scenarios at scale while measuring operational KPIs such as throughput, efficiency and utilization, all before deploying changes to the physical warehouse. Together with Nvidia, Kian and Accenture are reinventing industrial autonomy.
