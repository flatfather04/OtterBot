I love New York, and I'll leave here at some point they're gonna have to realize, like, hey, maybe instead of flying Mason and teams to San Francisco, you know, four or five times a year about there, but not gonna put that in their

S Speaker 21:44It's so unbelievably complicated, I'll give you the high level. It's one of my biggest griefs with, like working here. So basically, how we started, originally, probably longer a decade ago, was kind of the thesis that, you know, individual individuals don't have access to venture unless you're, you know, extremely high net worth, or if you're involved in really small, like Angel circles, even that's a pre seed, not really anything else. And the kind of thesis was like, Hey, we can raise capital based on university affiliation. And so that that worked. And so then it scaled up through different university ecosystems. I don't want to call it franchise model, because it was, like, done all under the same, you know, umbrella and investment teams. And so it's really kind of grown out of that. I've had another firm for like, four years. That's really when it started, you know, switching from, hey, that worked. That got us to scale. It's not really our focus now. So we'll still raise money around those kind of continuing, but it's now more into, like, targeted funds that are kind of sector based. So I'm on the agrobiotics team. Yeah, we have a tech Fund, which is actually somewhat the exact same as a robotics at this point. Also like strategic tech. We have the health tech team. So that's kind of we started, and right now it's more we'd see in a more general shop. We have a bunch of different, like, kind of self funds, and the reason for that is based, I believe it's like SEC regulation. With these funds that are open for retail, you can only have a certain number of people in the specific fund, and there's also a capital amount of capital, specific funds. So functionally, we are, I think, legally, like 12 separate teams all under the same roof for our deals. Like multiple kind of self funds will be invested in them at single time. But from anyone else who does not work here, it is extremely complicated, and our website does not provide you any answers. But world story we raised, you know, about one and a half billion dollars a day, you know, mostly committed funds, investing in specific sectors, and some of the fundraising with, like, the school, university stuff, it's just, it's

S Speaker 14:56Like, just this morning, we were having a discussion internally within the team around so how do we provide some of these problems? And we were looking at some of our IPOs. Which have happened recently, trying to figure out what were some of these team profiles. And a very interesting point came up is that people who priy, who have a lot of pride in themselves and are outrageously funny, actually make very interesting founders. So this might be completely correlation, not causation, in that sense, but very interesting. I'm actually

S Speaker 15:43right, right. Maybe I can take a step back, give you an introduction about the fun. I'm not sure if you have met members of the Qualcomm ventures team before, but I can give you overview of the fun and a little bit of my background. I am currently from India. I did my work with an early stage company in series, a solid probe unicorn. That was a great experience. But I've always been very sort of hands down across different ventures, given my entire drafting and wanted to get back into that, so I came to the US to make up everything to venture. Been here for about three and a half years, and have been on board in venture since then. I spent a year in LA working with Office ventures and then a couple of other funds, including mentor ventures and pay and then have been with Qualcomm for about a year and a half year as Senior Associate. What's interesting about the fund Mason is that we have expanded like initially, Qualcomm would be quite a lot investing in IoT hardware, semis, mobile technologies, connectivity technologies. We have expanded quite a lot from there, especially over the last few years, both as a corporate strategy wherein Qualcomm is now not just selling chips on silicon to mobile phones, but also expanded extensively across PCs. Now we have a chipset that go on personal computers and laptops, and has AI inferencing capabilities on device. We have a cloud data center play, which is not as good as MVL overflows, but still serves a lot of influence workloads. We have something in XR which is actually 90% of all XR devices apart the Qualcomm. Then we have quite a lot of IoT networking exposures since our previous year. So the company expanded quite a lot, and that meant that the ventures perspective has also expanded from not just investing in hardware. In fact, hardware is just about 20% of our investments. Now we have extensively started investing in software since the last four or five years, especially in AI. As you can imagine, AI has become one of the biggest focus areas for us. So we made good investments in the foundation model layer, anthropic hugging, phase, scale AI in the tool here. And we have to be looking at both the vertical, horizontal, applied AI stuff and at the same time as well, also embodied AI, which is robotics plus all the software stack that can go below that. So both of these areas, applications in AI and embodied AI are areas that I focus on. Semis has been like I have a partner in the team. She's particularly looking at semis and data center slack as well, such as scale of scale out kind of things. So probably would like to also loop her in the follow on conversation, so it's fair. But then particularly, I look at more software investments and the team itself. We've been around for 25 years, global fund. So have offices in six regions across the globe and invest roughly in us. We aim to deploy 150 to 100 $80 million a year, uh, check sizes two to 10, two to $15 million something like that. And then, very much like ourselves, we don't, we don't lead rounds, we don't negotiate prices and board seats, most of the times we participate around and just have a board of service. So that's that's kind of sweet spot for us from your

S Speaker 28:54Interesting. Yeah, the automotive space is super interesting. But, yeah, I talked to an interesting semiconductor company. It was like one of the head guys at Intel, who's the head of, like, Jim Keller at like, Tim store. And he was like, This guy was known as, like, Mr. Intel, for, like, whatever. That architect then went to Mercedes Benz and did all the AES stuff there. And now, basically they spun this company out of Mercedes to make like, a highly redundant chiplet. Basically, I've heard call it to basically use AI and autonomy and the most strength environments, whether that's, you know, self driving cars, obviously the most extreme. You can also scale it down for different kinds of i different kinds of level two to four, whatever what I'm talking about, but also at the future, also for aerospace and stuff. But Automotive is our team is, like, chewing on because the team there is, like, extraordinarily impressive. They have this, like, joint partnership with Mercedes. But we're also sitting Intel, lay off their entire automotive team. I was talking to the guys at untether for a long time, and ultimately get comfortable on it. And we're also trying to make an automotive that I on it. And we're also trying to make an automotive that acquired by AMD. We don't have intelligence, but it might be something that'd

But Automotive is our team is, like, chewing on because the team there is, like, extraordinarily impressive. They have this, like, joint partnership with Mercedes. But we're also sitting Intel, lay off their entire automotive team. I was talking to the guys at untether for a long time, and ultimately get comfortable on it. And we're also trying to make an automotive that I on it. And we're also trying to make an automotive that acquired by AMD. We don't have intelligence, but it might be something that'd
Interesting. Yeah, the automotive space is super interesting. But, yeah, I talked to an interesting semiconductor company. It was like one of the head guys at Intel, who's the head of, like, Jim Keller at like, Tim store. And he was like, This guy was known as, like, Mr. Intel, for, like, whatever. That architect then went to Mercedes Benz and did all the AES stuff there. And now, basically they spun this company out of Mercedes to make like, a highly redundant chiplet.

S Speaker 19:51be interesting to y'all specifically, yeah, I know there's another part of the team who's looking at automobile tech stack quite extensively. In fact, we were discussing a company called Safe Ride yesterday in the similar driver safety, Ada solution, probably l2, to n, Q, autonomy, uh, more consumer focused, but they barely I didn't get Mason.

S Speaker 210:09in? So we do. I would say new investments generally, seed through series we can go earlier than that. But, like, it's hard for us to do s go investors just do, like, Angel rounds, if that makes sense, and then Series C. I mean, like, you said, really seriously new investment, but like, preferably series A is, like the optimal we do a lot of seed, but it's a slightly different process, smaller checks, much, much like less investment committee involved, but it's extremely streamlined processes versus later stuff. Yeah, that's kind of where we sit for the most

S Speaker 210:52connections there as well. Yeah. I mean, anything that you find interesting, I'll happily take a look at it. I mean, we do we, we do a lot of investments, straight up with that. And, yeah, where, I mean, I'm on the AI robotic scene. It seems like most of the stuff you're looking at is thematically aligned. I mean, the way we kind of break it down now, obviously AI is everything, and so like, every company is.ai so like, our data is now, like, basically everything, but biotech bio, either way, their whole view is, you know, software is now selling actual work, and robotics are just kind of the same side of the coin. It's like one is selling working data center. One is translating intelligence into the physical world.

S Speaker 111:34totally get where you're coming from. So on body day, Qualcomm thesis is that down the line, a lot of these robotic plays, both human right and non humanoid, I would say we'll have multiple chips. Currently, they're using Jetson as Nvidia's Jetson as one of their core compute unit, but there'll be multiple distributed computer units, and Qualcomm would have to play because our power efficiency is better than Nvidia for smaller compute intensive tasks. So I'm doing a more structured thesis around this space, trying to look at not really per se, robotics, but mostly the software stack that would go behind it. So the data, strategy problem, companies acting that simulation, companies
totally get where you're coming from. So on body day, Qualcomm thesis is that down the line, a lot of these robotic plays, both human right and non humanoid, I would say we'll have multiple chips.

S Speaker 113:04human right might be the fact that both of us get proved wrong, but we may end up investing in one humanoid company that's most, mostly strategic mandate within the team. But in the team, we understand humanoid might be long term, even full foundation model for physical AI might be long term. So looking at a few vertical foundation model companies as well. So I put everything together in a small maybe one page and send it across your way sometime next week. So it across

S Speaker 213:23your way sometime next week. Yeah, that'd be great. And I'm trying to think of one other companies we have that are racing somewhat soon, soon. I mean, this might be y'all doing stuff like quantum software. So quantum
your way sometime next week. Yeah, that'd be great. And I'm trying to think of one other companies we have that are racing somewhat soon, soon. I mean, this might be y'all doing stuff like quantum software. So quantum

S Speaker 113:31has surprisingly come back very big now and then there is, there is a effort that we actually discussed yesterday on our Monday meetings that we need to specially look at quantum. There are a few quantum companies which have started reaching out to us through bankers. Us through bankers. And seems like probably the NVIDIA push around quantum data has come back. So we will take a look. We haven't done quantum, say, in the last four, five years. Previous to that, there was some internal research effort at Quantum as well, but, but we started

S Speaker 213:53looking at Quantum. Now, of that chart that like didn't walk out of computers, all the quantum companies like we're in, we're in seven of them. Our deals are like highlighted one of them, if you're a company called, like, Q control, basically, yeah, so like quantum sensing side, not
looking at Quantum. Now, of that chart that like didn't walk out of computers, all the quantum companies like we're in, we're in seven of them. Our deals are like highlighted one of them, if you're a company called, like, Q control, basically, yeah, so like quantum sensing side, not

S Speaker 114:05really, but Q control was a portfolio company at market where I spent a year at. So they're going
really, but Q control was a portfolio company at market where I spent a year at. So they're going
really, but Q control was a portfolio company at market where I spent a year at. So they're going
really, but Q control was a portfolio company at market where I spent a year at. So they're going
S Speaker 214:09out for like a Series C right now. But basically, they did use that same technology that would recognize quantum computers, maybe for quantum sensing. And so they had a thing with, like Airbus and Lockheed Martin for these, you know, small quantum sensors that, yeah, they outperform for GPS and I navigation must be very specific there. But out specific there, but outperform incumbent solutions by, like, 50, 110x like with, obviously what's happening in the Middle East and Russia, Ukraine, plus also Taiwan, China. Like these, GPS tonight, navigation are causing really big trouble for people, and even for just like commercial flights. And so they've gotten a ton of recent traction surrounding that. And like they they like 100 plus million dollars in the bank, but they're just, like, strategically raising capital. That's a little different than, like the traditional, you know, Qualcomm comms, but it is adjacent, if it's interested there. Absolutely,
out for like a Series C right now. But basically, they did use that same technology that would recognize quantum computers, maybe for quantum sensing.

S Speaker 114:49I think that would be interesting. We the managing partner, is involved. We are looking at Quantum there is a push from the leadership. So for sure, it would be interesting.

S Speaker 215:04so that's kind of that side. I'm trying to think who else would be that world most on the software side, it's human to Yeah, kind of take it there and think that's kind of all that's coming up. And you said, y'all do call it seed through
so that's kind of that side. I'm trying to think who else would be that world most on the software side, it's human to Yeah, kind of take it there and think that's kind of all that's coming up. And you said, y'all do call it seed through

S Speaker 115:22seed through even pre IPO round. So the later, the easier for us. I would say, just
seed through even pre IPO round. So the later, the easier for us. I would say, just
seed through even pre IPO round. So the later, the easier for us. I would say, just
seed through even pre IPO round. So the later, the easier for us. I would say, just
S Speaker 215:28because there's more, yeah, more traction that makes, that makes complete sense on the robotic side. I mean, any interest in in mining, by any chance,
because there's more, yeah, more traction that makes, that makes complete sense on the robotic side. I mean, any interest in in mining, by any chance,

S Speaker 115:39haven't really looked at that. So we've been looking at some humanoid companies. Figure in terms of traction has been the most advanced, but the valuation is crazy. They're raising at a 40 billion. And let me
haven't really looked at that. So we've been looking at some humanoid companies. Figure in terms of traction has been the most advanced, but the valuation is crazy. They're raising at a 40 billion. And let me

S Speaker 215:54restate my earlier statement. I am bullish at humanoid robots at the price they're at. Like I have a friend who's an early investor, I'd figure it. I think he just dumped all of his least, like half of secondaries, like he's I know what the company actually does and where they are, and it's like, it's not 39 billion
restate my earlier statement. I am bullish at humanoid robots at the price they're at. Like I have a friend who's an early investor, I'd figure it.

S Speaker 116:13totally. I get that we've been looking at a few other companies humanoid space, but we haven't looked at vertical robotics across different sectors. More recently, I think we evaluated a food robotics company recently, sometime back, sorry, is it chef robotics? Yes, it was chef robotics, yeah.

So we've been invested in chef for probably two and a half years now. So chefs.
S Speaker 116:36Chef was actually quite a good company, very, very strong traction, and the pipeline also was very strong. Unfortunately, we could not do it, but it will probably end up as one of our regrets.

S Speaker 216:47Yeah, well, I mean, I hope y'all regret that personally, but yeah. I mean, we have a couple other things in the robotic space. I mean, I tend to look at what I call, like, kind of critical industries, whether it's energy, like, things that are just high value. So we have a, I'm a board observer at a company called Eric's robotics that basically does oil and gas refinery pipeline inspection. So all of those are, like, under installation, and so, like, basically no one checks these pipelines and they blow up. Like, every year I say blow up. It's not, like, cute, boom. But like, when you have to turn off a refinery for two or three days, three days, you know, that's 20 plus million dollars. And so they basically are able to give you continuous data on it. And so they're doing pretty well. And then the mining company specifically was, yeah, autonomous drilling for, like, very thin and narrow veins. They're raising a Series A right now, but it's like, if you imagine, you do all the geophysical surveying for to try to find these minerals, only certain parts of it make economical sense to extract. Like, no, there's shit ton of stuff here, but it's like, super narrow and vertical, and in order for us to, like, excavate it, we'd lose money doing it. And they're basically using, you know, AI guided stuff, to extract it. And so it's super interesting. Might be out of your wheelhouse, but
Yeah, well, I mean, I hope y'all regret that personally, but yeah. I mean, we have a couple other things in the robotic space.

S Speaker 118:05for some of these companies, Mason, do you think at the stage, at around series A do they show enough traction? Do we have enough on their data room? I would say, like a chef would for us to create a story around the current traction, in the pipeline, in the future, I think that's a critical factor for us. In

I guess they'll have, like, a million of revenue or like, but it's not, you know, it's not like software, you know, it's not like recurring, it's like, we did a million dollars of pilots this year, and you're kind of just like, yeah, sure, and they're usually priced accordingly also, but it is, for sure, a lot of

S Speaker 219:05trying to think if it was, look at a couple other vertical AI companies right now, though, if that's, if that's more nails wheelhouse, they're just, yeah, just straight up vertical AI. There's one, it's kind of like a Harvey alternative, but it's more open source and better. It's one of my good friends actually founded it. It's like, the CEO is a guy who's, like, big loft right here. Is the other guy runs Oh AI research lab, and I think it's the largest sub stack for artificial intelligence called the it's literally called artificial intelligence made simple, but he's like, super embedded with the anthropic cursors, what have you, of the world and most knowledgeable person who own AI, and they're getting a lot of traction. They went from, I think zero to think 400,000 in ARR within three months or four months since just launched. It'd be a seed stage. Also, it might be too small of a round for y'all. I think they're only trying to raise like two to raise like two to 3 million,

S Speaker 220:50yeah? Because, I mean, there's one company on the semiconductor side that I didn't mention, just because it's they, they were going to raise a Series A and then they got so much government funding that they, like, don't need to anymore, yeah. But I'm just like, can you please just raise an A like, because, like, we have, like, a seed check in there, and so usually we step up for the A, and I'm like, No, I don't want you to skip the A. I want to, right? But basically, they're making, I would think of it. It's like, not quite, it's between, like, an FPGA.

So it's like a reprogrammable ASIC performance, but a completely reprogrammable, but mostly for for comms, you sensor fusion and stuff like that, but on a very, very small scale. So they're using it a lot for, like software, to find radios and stuff like that. But it's very, very much like comms, sensor fusion, that kind of stuff. Obviously, it has applications for, like, self driving cars, but I'm telling them not to do automotive. Yeah, it's a graveyard, but that would be one that I think would be really interesting just given work Qualcomm, you know, the actual Qualcomm business lines,

S Speaker 223:06yeah, I'll let you know. I think I am, though, going to plan to come for hot chips at the end of August. And then, honestly, we have so many companies out there that I'll probably go to the conference like one or two days, and then, like, maniacally, go between the Bay Area and downtown San Francisco because I am incapable of planning that. I always think right next to each other and spending half my time in the car. But it's is what it is. But I'll let you know. And yeah, we'd love to make this like a quarterly and once you finish other kind of internal thoughts on on that, just send it to me next week.
