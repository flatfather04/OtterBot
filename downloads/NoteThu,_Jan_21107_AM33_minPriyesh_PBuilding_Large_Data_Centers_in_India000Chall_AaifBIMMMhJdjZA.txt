S Speaker 10:00To focus on photos, documents, on detail, stuff. So the bottleneck in this thing is, where can we build these large data centers and power them? Where can we get the power Yeah. And if you look at the World Data Center market, most of it is in the US, yes. And India now, I mean, it's very much focusing on having its own sovereign AI, so it wants to incentivize Indian based companies to build infrastructure owned by owned and completely deployed within India. So looking at this, we have named our next we have named our company unfixed cloud, yeah. And what we are trying to build is get access to huge amount of electricity. So, I mean, you might know, people are talking about gig, about level of electricity, and the bottleneck is, where do you get the powers? Or these things are coming, that nuclear power station that's next to it now, yeah, all these things are coming. And of course, you talk about sustainability. So people want to be sustainable. I mean, these people have sustainable metrics. But where do you get the power so all these market demands comes. So this is where this thing is from a market point of view. I also tell where I am coming from. So I mean, from a CS student. The most important thing is, how do you train these models? How do

S Speaker 11:34vision models you can develop like a GPU cluster. You can do it on your house. But if you start working with transformers, you need large compute, which I ended up meeting. But because compute was not there, no progress was able to then we thought, okay, let's focus on Compute. Because if I am facing this problem, hundreds of people other than us are facing this problem, nobody is able to get compute sustainably, like if you go to Google Cloud, like you might go to the end page and they will say, No, we don't have so last year there was a huge crunch. Now it's easy because I mean Nvidia also production lines are happening, and other players are also entering among the cerebral and couple of more. So what is happening is, yes, GPUs are available, but now what is happening is where you are not able to sustainably get power. So if all across the world, USS has the most data centers, there is need for more data centers, specifically for gi compute. So we are focusing on India. Get compute in India, build a compute in India service all across the world. So very much built in India, service everywhere. And this was very much not a SaaS kind of structure, which is like very small based company, just an idea. And it's more like a long term deployment of capital infrastructure. Because, you know, the South itself, and infrastructure, if it comes in, and government comes because you can't do a proper public, sorry, private, complete implement. So last six months since we met, I mean, I was there in SF, just to understand, I mean, what really the market itself, yeah. So since then, since last six months, my semester was also happening, but also I've been working to so we have come to a place that we have got Park, which is very, very important, because that is something just disclosing this in open forum, 100 people will come. Okay, let's see we can get power immediately. So we have got power. I have some papers also. I'll show you which the government things are there. And so power is the most important thing. Other thing is network. So the fiber has already been laid by fiber, which is right now, being used just for Facebook and Instagram, all this thing, but fiber is there. So we have gone we are talking to multiple states. One state is very prominent with us, and they have promising power network. And we are having discussions about land. So we had, like, at least 1015, site visits. Okay, is this a good place? Because all three things have to have to be the power network, and another thing is cooling, because these GPUs require huge amount of compute, you need to cool them sustainably. So you need to have access to water just next to the compute to be able to water cool the whole system. So, because number of constraints, increase the number of side points, increases we have right now come down to two sites. So this is in terms of the site.
vision models you can develop like a GPU cluster. You can do it on your house. But if you start working with transformers, you need large compute, which I ended up meeting.

S Speaker 15:13priority of the central government. There are, we are talking about, you know, 10,000 crores this whole budget, and we are buying, and if they are asking other people to buy another because they understand that. Now, let me show you the commitment letter. So this is something which people who invest in this, right? They will look at it, okay, these guys have power, and they will try to come in and say, Okay, let us finance as an earlier financing. Because if any government body is telling you you have power and they're willing to put in the same then they then all these big guys come in say that, okay, but we don't want to go that route. What we want to do is we want to do the VC route, because we want to start small. We want to say, Okay, this is something which we are going to do a proof of concept with, buy some GPU, buy the land by the buying thing, and after proving that, because then we have this thing that we want to focus more on startups, more on those systems, other than directly selling into Google, Microsoft, those guys, yeah, if I, if you publicly disclose these, these guys can come in and, you know, crush us down and say, okay, only Google is going to come in this year. We don't want that. The Indian government does not want that. The state government does not want that because software, it is priority.

S Speaker 26:42This is very interesting, and it's also a very large scale problem, like you mentioned. It's not like a SaaS business that you can build up any other day. I'm just very curious on how are you able to manage this entire large scale project?
This is very interesting, and it's also a very large scale problem, like you mentioned. It's not like a SaaS business that you can build up any other day. I'm just very curious on how are you able to manage this entire large scale project?

S Speaker 16:55Yeah, the thing is, technically, it's not very challenging.
Yeah, the thing is, technically, it's not very challenging.
Yeah, the thing is, technically, it's not very challenging.
Yeah, the thing is, technically, it's not very challenging.
7:02Can you say this thing? Not yet. No, what about now?
Can you say this thing? Not yet. No, what about now?
Can you say this thing? Not yet. No, what about now?
Can you say this thing? Not yet. No, what about now?
7:08No, no, I can see that Infinity Mirror thing.
No, no, I can see that Infinity Mirror thing.
No, no, I can see that Infinity Mirror thing.
No, no, I can see that Infinity Mirror thing.
S Speaker 17:17Oh, sorry. Now, yes, okay, so so
Oh, sorry. Now, yes, okay, so so
Oh, sorry. Now, yes, okay, so so
Oh, sorry. Now, yes, okay, so so
S Speaker 17:28you can see this. Check, yeah. Okay. Now this, so this is state of Uttarakhand, you know, which has very high levels of renewable energy. So lots of dams are here. There is steady damage in India, Pakistan, and all of it goes to national grid. And the status thing from the national grid will, we are willing to send it to you. This is one of the very important sites which we have basically shot down to right. So this is a canal, okay, so this is water canal. And these lines are all power lines. So this is 400 kilowatt, this is 200 kilowatt, 130 kilowatt, 600 kilowatt. So these are, like huge amount of power infrastructure is already there this. Take this takes power from this. Will take it from TV dam and deliver it to me. Are you familiar with this region? Whether, not as much. No. So, okay, okay. So, let me just say this is a very premium site. Okay. This is something that an industrial park is here, so lot of infrastructure is already there, okay? And we have been able to figure it land, which is next to water, which is important for our constraints, and the power infrastructure is already there. Why this is important is because any other side, right? Any other general thing, people talk, okay, let's build a data center here. Let's talk to utility companies. Bring the power cables here. Let's bring the network companies bring the cables here, right? So power is already here. And in terms of network, I have another figure. So fiber is also very nearby, right? So this is a side key there. The fiber is also there new data. So most of the infrastructure is there. But the thing is, in India, people don't know the importance of resource. Most of this work is happening in the US. In India, the data center companies, which are there, they are also focusing on journal compute, which is like, how do you run these servers for your Netflix applications, for YouTube applications? So most of a compute, not very much of genai compute, is so if you want to go buy a computer in India, Mumbai is there. Otherwise, Singapore is there. These are the two cases. And most of the computers in Singapore, they have their own data logs and stuff like that. So there is a need for not just training, even inference. Yeah, as we all know, we all are and since last year, we have been using all these AI, exponentially and publicity and all these things. These guys need compute. And India has to need compute. Right now. The API goal is going to Singapore and Mumbai. All of this region is being underserved. So there is a need for DC from data center infrastructure in India. This is very near to Delhi as well. Next I'm going to show you is so this is the power thing, which we are going to tap it. All these lines are already there.
you can see this. Check, yeah. Okay. Now this, so this is state of Uttarakhand, you know, which has very high levels of renewable energy. So lots of dams are here. There is steady damage in India, Pakistan, and all of it goes to national grid. And the status thing from the national grid will, we are willing to send it to you.

There is steady damage in India, Pakistan, and all of it goes to national grid. And the status thing from the national grid will, we are willing to send it to you. This is one of the very important sites which we have basically shot down to right. So this is a canal, okay, so this is water canal. And these lines are all power lines. So this is 400 kilowatt, this is 200 kilowatt, 130 kilowatt, 600 kilowatt. So these are, like huge amount of power infrastructure is already there this. Take this takes power from this. Will take it from TV dam and deliver it to me. Are you familiar with this region? Whether, not as much. No. So, okay, okay. So, let me just say this is a very premium site. Okay. This is something that an industrial park is here, so lot of infrastructure is already there, okay? And we have been able to figure it land, which is next to water, which is important for our constraints, and the power infrastructure is already there. Why this is important is because any other side, right? Any other general thing, people talk, okay, let's build a data center here. Let's talk to utility companies. Bring the power cables here. Let's bring the network companies bring the cables here, right? So power is already here. And in terms of network, I have another figure. So fiber is also very nearby, right? So this is a side key there. The fiber is also there new data. So most of the infrastructure is there. But the thing is, in India, people don't know the importance of resource. Most of this work is happening in the US. In India, the data center companies, which are there, they are also focusing on journal compute, which is like, how do you run these servers for your Netflix applications, for YouTube applications? So most of a compute, not very much of genai compute, is so if you want to go buy a computer in India, Mumbai is there. Otherwise, Singapore is there. These are the two cases. And most of the computers in Singapore, they have their own data logs and stuff like that. So there is a need for not just training, even inference. Yeah, as we all know, we all are and since last year, we have been using all these AI, exponentially and publicity and all these things. These guys need compute. And India has to need compute. Right now. The API goal is going to Singapore and Mumbai. All of this region is being underserved. So there is a need for DC from data center infrastructure in India. This is very near to Delhi as well. Next I'm going to show you is so this is the power thing, which we are going to tap it. All these lines are already there.
S Speaker 210:43Yeah, and this is government land, is it? This is irrigation land,
Yeah, and this is government land, is it? This is irrigation land,
Yeah, and this is government land, is it? This is irrigation land,
Yeah, and this is government land, is it? This is irrigation land,
12:33so that they can begin that land process.
so that they can begin that land process.
so that they can begin that land process.
so that they can begin that land process.
S Speaker 112:38This is that, you know, okay, our company is there, but they want to know the promoters of the company, which we have been able to do this much work without any need for a specific financed committee, because we have, I'll show you, my team also, I think I don't know.
This is that, you know, okay, our company is there, but they want to know the promoters of the company, which we have been able to do this much work without any need for a specific financed committee, because we have, I'll show you, my team also, I think I don't know.

13:03I'll find that document right now. Yeah, so, so what, where we are is
I'll find that document right now. Yeah, so, so what, where we are is
I'll find that document right now. Yeah, so, so what, where we are is
I'll find that document right now. Yeah, so, so what, where we are is
15:29build in this space as
build in this space as

build in this space as
S Speaker 115:34basically convincing them, you know, this is a real project. And once that thing happens, then we will go to the markets and see that, you know, all our ingredients are ready. Now we are going to raise capital. So the capital which, the first capital which we raise, will be about, you know, buying the land, because this is government land, so you lease it for 99 years, or depending on how much you want. So that thing
basically convincing them, you know, this is a real project. And once that thing happens, then we will go to the markets and see that, you know, all our ingredients are ready.

So that thing
15:59and the power Bucha.
S Speaker 116:02So even the kind of scale which we are talking about is very key. I don't want to directly talk to anyone out there, because if I talk to someone and say, this much amount of power is available, which is like half a gigawatt. So that that kind of scale, I'm scared, you know, anybody would just hog over us with the kind of capital. Once I have that power purchase agreement signed in, you understand power, the utility will provide this power, and this is, these are the so once that is signed on, then I can go to open markets and saying that now we have secured this. We are going to be building this now. We are happy to welcome investors, in a sense. So, so this is where I am in general. And

S Speaker 216:55So bro, how what? Give me a sense of the timeline from the point of you getting an LOI to acquisition of land, to signing power position and building the entire infrastructure, getting customers to revenue coming in, how long do you think that entire timeline would

S Speaker 119:23right to tell the government that, you know, what we are building is valuable, and lot of companies, including ourselves, are willing to invest in this project, given that all the basic ingredients are covered. You know, network, power, utility, environmental clearances and these things. This is not like a non committed letter. It is just convincing them that the global market is willing and moving in this direction. And this is something which like from at least even, for example, at a stretch, saying that even we would be willing to invest in the space, given that, you know, all these constraints are there? Constraint basically, conditions are

20:11figured out interesting.
figured out interesting.

figured out interesting.
S Speaker 220:35Make sense, bro, one constraint that I feel right now is it doesn't like, I'm being honest with you, it doesn't feel very much like a VC investment space kyogi. There is one, a lot of risk involved. And those risks are, aren't something that I would say a VC investor would understand, basically, land acquisition, India may regulations, policy or yes, even Qualcomm has an investment in COVID But did it only because of the hardware angle behind it, but not because there was an entire infrastructure risk, regulation, risk and things like that. At least if I, if I discuss this within the team, they will completely show it off because samajal or they won't be able to underwrite it. And the second thing is, the project completion would take five years, so at least Qualcomm, although we have an evergreen fund, but most of the VC funds, they need to deploy capital in three years and start exiting in seven years. Let's say a fund would have a timeline of 10 years. So 7 million exit Karna. So if you say that, if you invest today, I will be building it in five years, so it doesn't meet the timelines. And hence, that would also be a concern for a lot of VC funds. So much decree at the top of it, yeah, you were saying something just
Make sense, bro, one constraint that I feel right now is it doesn't like, I'm being honest with you, it doesn't feel very much like a VC investment space kyogi. There is one, a lot of risk involved.

22:04to answer that. You know,
to answer that. You know,
to answer that. You know,
to answer that. You know,
S Speaker 122:08it's not five years, five years till full capacity. So since POC happens in two years, then it's like a linear scale, moving on. And of course, I also understand this is a huge the ticket size is huge. Yeah, the ticket size is huge. And I understand that VCs don't invest this ticket size. But the thing is, if I go to corporate VC or CBR, CBRE or JL, these guys like I what I want is, I don't need VCs money exactly, but I need they're saying that, okay, you know, this is a very valuable project. And given the space we are there right now, lots of investors, including ourselves, to invest in this space in a sense that, you know, so that what, basically, I need the government to understand that, you know, this is valuable, and investors, we have backers that, you know, if I say that, I'm going to you're doing all this work. You're processing on this land tomorrow. This is something very valuable, and people are willing to underwrite land acquisition and power purchase, agreement acquisition. The other why I'm taking this out and not the other out is because once the PPE is done, then I can openly say to everyone, you know, this is thing. If the PPA before that, then it becomes like, you know, we are still a startup. If a Google comes in and says, you know, just throw them out. And so this will allow me to completely capture the space.
it's not five years, five years till full capacity. So since POC happens in two years, then it's like a linear scale, moving on.

S Speaker 223:46Makes sense, man. So from that perspective, would you will it be fine if you get someone to write you an LOI is a non minding So, and then they don't complete
Makes sense, man. So from that perspective, would you will it be fine if you get someone to write you an LOI is a non minding So, and then they don't complete

S Speaker 124:01100% on, I don't want anything non binding. What I want is something convincing them I don't whatever you write, if you want to write or maybe discuss with your team and say, I don't want it's nothing to do with writing, sorry, binding. You can completely write all these terms, conditions, whatever, however the language is. I don't want anything to do with that. But I just want to show them that people are interested in this. And people, if, you know, if, for example, the Joint Secretary has to bring five departments together, he has motivation saying that, you know, tomorrow, these people are interested. And this is a real project, because he has different kind of thinking. This kind of project is not there in India right now. It's not like manufacturing motorcycles or building a pharmaceutical. It's like a different kind of field space, right? So, so that, that is how so even if you write something, it's not like you have to put money, or even commit to put money or just say, just say that. You know, this is space we like to invest and
100% on, I don't want anything non binding.

You know, this is space we like to invest and
S Speaker 125:06we are looking at there, and given all conditions constraints are required, we, among other investors, do like to invest in this space, something like that. So how and language is something which can be figured out. It's not like I don't want non binding. There's nothing illegal about it, but more like convincing those Joint Secretary to, you know, work on
we are looking at there, and given all conditions constraints are required, we, among other investors, do like to invest in this space, something like that.

S Speaker 125:39The thing is, I don't mind about tears, but I want them to know this company is real. It's like, you know, if some, like some I taught them street funds, they have their company's name, but nobody knows that. So convincing them, it will be like, this is actually, they don't have a good website, but they are real in a sense, right, right?

S Speaker 127:08What I was thinking is, maybe, because I want completely non binding, I don't want to put any pressure, yeah, if, because Qualcomm is invested in COVID, so they understand, yes, what the business is even tomorrow, if COVID wants to expand in India, right then, we are there. The site is there, the power is there. The chips are there. You can come and, you know, buy compute from austerity. So this like an expansion of their compute in this continent. Right now, COVID is in us, and I think London, they're building something like huh? Let me, let me have a chat. I do see it will be very difficult, but my bad, Monday, go everyone like the office starts on Monday, so I will have this discussion on the sixth. I will let you know.

S Speaker 227:57But it seems difficult. I'm just being honest with you. It seems difficult, because the team is that way. They don't want to take a lot of random risk, and it would be and it'll be difficult to get it through compliance.

S Speaker 228:15Nobody would like to sign on it right? And then there are a few people who sign on and on behalf of Qualcomm or Qualcomm ventures, and then you for them to sign on it, they have a specific compliance team or legal review team to take a look at everything that they're signing and then it will start raising a lot of questions. Before we do this, all of that,

S Speaker 129:57your chips, many actually Qualcomm chips can name. We are actually also talking to Grog CD press. So if Qualcomm says, you know, we have, this is a facility. Who are Nvidia? Are they selling it? They are sending it to data centers, yeah, for example, it's like a supply chain thing. No, yeah, if you build a customer, then tomorrow we can buy your chips. This thing we are thinking of doing with Samsung, actually, Samsung sells such hard drives, right? They sell their hard drives. They want to, rather than getting an upfront, they want to do a subscription, sorry, storage as a subscription kind of service. So they, rather than upfront costs, they are willing to do a monthly rent master. So there are those kind of business models. But the thing is, for me to, I think now is the time, because now it's I have to build solutions. Right now. I was thinking more in terms of land, okay, so figure out,
your chips, many actually Qualcomm chips can name. We are actually also talking to Grog CD press. So if Qualcomm says, you know, we have, this is a facility. Who are Nvidia? Are they selling it?

31:06as our situation,
S Speaker 131:09actually, it's a good proposition. If Qualcomm is trying to sell these chips, right, they are going to sell it to data centers only, and they would also need a POC, yeah, you know, if a data center says that your chips are very well, and we have integrated them into the whole system, and we have APIs running llms Running on our chips, and so that can be like a proof of concept, because Qualcomm would need to do a POC with someone or the other, right? Yeah, they have recently started a POC with G 42
actually, it's a good proposition.
