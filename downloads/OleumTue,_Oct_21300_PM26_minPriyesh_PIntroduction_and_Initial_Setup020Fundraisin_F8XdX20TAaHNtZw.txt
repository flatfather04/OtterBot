S Speaker 10:37about you? I understood. Evan, the team Qualcomm ventures, most of us are here in the Bay Area, and then some members in San Diego. Office, where are headquarters is, yeah, it was great to catch up catch the demo on the speedrun demo day. Even pretty interesting product. We have spent some time in the entire, I would say, data preparation space for ml workflows, and one of our investments in this area was K AI a couple of rounds before their acquisition. So we have spent some time in this space. Very interesting before we start. Evan, happy to give you an intro about myself and the fund and how we operate. What are our decision timelines and processes like that? I just want to quickly sort of understand how big a round Are you raising right now, and how long would the time, or what's the timeline internally on your end? Yeah,

S Speaker 21:28so I can just give it kind of framework. So I think we're thinking in the three to 4 million range in terms of timeline. You received a verbal offer confirm that we'll receive a term sheet tomorrow that will cover the entire round. We're not committed to accepting that, and we've also made it very clear with every investor we talked to that we're not going to be really time pressured, and that the main point of this round actually is to get in some seed stage funds or funds that we would not be able to work with later. Yeah, we find the partnerships to be valuable. Because initially our plan before Demo Day was actually to just skip the seed and raise an A about four months, five months. But we had a lot of inbound from seed funds that wanted to get into this round, so we thought we would at least talk to them and make and see if there are any partnerships that we really wanted to make while we still could. So that's our viewing. It not super time sensitive,

S Speaker 15:17that's where we are. Evan, happy to have a chat. The my major concern would be the round size at the moment, so just wanted to be open about that. But I would love to have a chat, sort of learn more about what you guys are building, and maybe we have space for the next

S Speaker 25:32round. Yeah, that makes sense. I mean, as you said, the lowest would be two to 2.5 Yes. Andy, are you What is? What is the concern is that, because we're going to raise more

S Speaker 25:46don't think it should be a huge concern. It would probably be slightly under the five, which you said was, like your target, like lower end of the target. But, yeah, as I said, we're not the the capital and the valuation are less sensitive than picking the right partners right we would have use for for money in any case. But yeah, I'm happy to have this conversation. We'll see if it works for this round or next. But yeah, some makes sense to do. I give my my introduction, and then the team, and then kind of the company and we go from there,

S Speaker 26:25my background, I started, I got involved in startups when I was very young. I was 15 years old, and I was auditing a class at UC Berkeley, and I was waiting for my mom to pick me up in a park, and there were these two guys walking around, and they were, you know, putting their phones in people's faces and taking notes. And I was curious what they were doing, so I walked over and they gave me the pitch for this app they made. Called down to lunch, and they showed me the app and asked for my feedback. And I told them very honestly that I did not really like it, and I had a lot of negative feedback from they it told me that they actually like negative feedback more than positive. So that they asked to take me to lunch and we got Chipotle. They told me about like more about their working on to get more feedback. At the end of it, they invited me to their apartment, and they said, How would you like to spend your summer, basically just envy a partner with us, and we'll basically show you product features. You can give us feedback. And I told them, that sounded great. So I worked with these two founders for that summer, the summer following, and they continually pivoted to new new products. And eventually, when I was 17 or 18, my senior year of high school, they landed on alchemy, and I joined as like the first non engineering hire. The team was about six people at the time, and I watched it scale from that to being a $10 billion company. It was kind of in the passenger seat while Nikhil and Joe ran the show, but I learned a lot just kind of being surrounded by that, and yeah, Kiel has been a great mentor to me, so that was kind of my foray into the space. After working there for a while, I realized that I love the startup energy, but I wanted it to be my company, like, I wanted to have, like, a more central role in determining things. So I was always on the on the lookout for cool, cool opportunities. And about seven months into working at alchemy full time, after graduating college, my friend Leo, who I know since I was 11, he was my high school debate partner and childhood friend, he told me he was thinking about leaving Bridgewater, where he had been a quant researcher for three years, to start a startup. And he tried to pitch me on it and explain why it would be worth leaving, and I was pretty convinced. So the two of us decided to leave our jobs. And as Leo was leaving, he told one of his co workers, who had been a quant researcher for seven years about what they were planning to do, and actually convinced him to leave his job, leave Bridgewater as well. So the three of us all left around January, raised a $2.4 million pre seed led by village global and a 16 that round closed in June. We built out the product for a couple months and then started our sales process about, I guess, two months ago. Now, since raising that money, we hired Leo, our CEO's former manager from Bridgewater. He was the head of Asia strategies at the firm, and he is now our Head of Product Engineering. And then we added one more software engineer, so we're five people. Product MVP is built, and sales process is kind of just getting started, but that's kind of overhead

S Speaker 19:53that's amazing, Evan, and thanks a lot for sharing the background. It's a lot of successes in a very short period of time. So congrats on that. That it means a lot, like you hitting the right traction so early, it means a lot. So congrats on that. That's incredible. Evan, I would love to understand a little bit more about the market what we have the companies that we have spoken to have mostly been around, say, data cleaning and data preparation before ml workflow start. And I believe this is probably a step ahead in the workflow. But correct me if I'm wrong there, and I'd love to understand how this market operates and why, probably that's the second question. So I'll come to that later.

S Speaker 210:34Okay, yeah, so where we kind of sit, so I guess, like the product, just to make it more concrete, is we just build AI agents for individual data sets. So when a guy makes a data set, they make a lot of decisions, and they try to document those decisions in a PDF they then send to the client, so the client can understand what they're looking at. The issue is, it does a very, very poor job at explaining what the data actually shows and how it should be used, ideally. So anyone using third party data will usually have a period of time, maybe two to three weeks, if not longer, where they're just trying to wrangle the data and understand what they're looking at, what the cleaning procedures would even be. And all this is downstream from basically the context that the human being, the SME, who made it decisions he made. So what we try to do is take all of the knowledge that that subject matter expert has, the guy who made the data set originally, and consolidate it and make an AI agent out of it, and then deploy that to the client. So the idea here is, anything you want to do downstream, whether it's the cleaning, whether it's modeling, normalizing, back, testing, all of these functions we think are informed by the context you have about the data. So that's what we've basically built. We basically build this, a agent that accompanies the data set so that when the data vendor sells, it me as the buyer. I'm not like sitting in a support queue trying to ask a question to this product expert. I can just ask the chat bot and get up to speed on the data, figure out how things were calculated, how tables relate to each other, and then it also serves like a co pilot for them doing the rest of the process, the kind of cleaning and modeling that you discuss

And all this is downstream from basically the context that the human being, the SME, who made it decisions he made. So what we try to do is take all of the knowledge that that subject matter expert has, the guy who made the data set originally, and consolidate it and make an AI agent out of it, and then deploy that to the client. So the idea here is, anything you want to do downstream, whether it's the cleaning, whether it's modeling, normalizing, back, testing, all of these functions we think are informed by the context you have about the data. So that's what we've basically built. We basically build this, a agent that accompanies the data set so that when the data vendor sells, it me as the buyer. I'm not like sitting in a support queue trying to ask a question to this product expert. I can just ask the chat bot and get up to speed on the data, figure out how things were calculated, how tables relate to each other, and then it also serves like a co pilot for them doing the rest of the process, the kind of cleaning and modeling that you discuss
Okay, yeah, so where we kind of sit, so I guess, like the product, just to make it more concrete, is we just build AI agents for individual data sets. So when a guy makes a data set, they make a lot of decisions, and they try to document those decisions in a PDF they then send to the client, so the client can understand what they're looking at. The issue is, it does a very, very poor job at explaining what the data actually shows and how it should be used, ideally. So anyone using third party data will usually have a period of time, maybe two to three weeks, if not longer, where they're just trying to wrangle the data and understand what they're looking at, what the cleaning procedures would even be.

S Speaker 112:24understood and Evan, so in that case, your buyers would be the sellers of these data sources, rather than the buyers of data, right? It's actually both, okay, yeah,
understood and Evan, so in that case, your buyers would be the sellers of these data sources, rather than the buyers of data, right? It's actually both, okay, yeah,

understood and Evan, so in that case, your buyers would be the sellers of these data sources, rather than the buyers of data, right? It's actually both, okay, yeah,
S Speaker 213:54So yeah, there's a ton that you would never be able to find otherwise. Like, for example, I might have a column titled date, date and time, and it shows the date, and that shows the time. I don't know as the buyer, if that was the date that the event occurred, or if it's the date that the data was collected. And if I want to make like a time series, I need to know the exact point in time that would not show up in a table. It shows up in documentation, and in some cases, it doesn't show up in documentation. And if it doesn't, and there's some reason you need that information, or there's some edge case about like, how it was sampled, right? That I want to know there's only usually one person at SNP global or at FactSet who has my answer, and it might take me two weeks to get that answer from the guy. So, yeah, basically what we do is we take all the information that is not in the data and make an AI agent out of it. With that in mind, though, the AI agents still can do a lot of the data discovery chat GPT, or like GPT five is quite poor at understanding things like tables and rows, not to say that it won't get there. I assume it will. In the meantime, though, we have built an algorithm that does a lot of this schema inference. It kind of infers how things are related based on just the structure of the data, right? So we built that out already, but most of the value comes from our ability to like, collect context from the vendor, and then also collect context from the buyer. So because we deploy this agent into your individual server, like your personal environment, your company's private environment, our customers feel confident they can actually include their own code bases, their own, like Confluence pages that discuss how they use data, and then the agents basically talk together to figure out how, given these two sides of context, should we go about cleaning this data? Because all that is once again downstream from, like the use case, it's downstream from how the data was collected. So that's kind of how it functions.
So yeah, there's a ton that you would never be able to find otherwise. Like, for example, I might have a column titled date, date and time, and it shows the date, and that shows the time.

S Speaker 219:41Yeah, the way that it works, at least in the hedge fund world, is quite straightforward. We basically have an aggregated list of the largest hedge funds by data spend. Yeah, we start at the top, and then we go down. I map out the org charts. Use our various connections meetings so far. Even though our sales process is only a month old, we have scheduled meetings with six of the 10 largest hedge funds in the world, and all of them, we are speaking with someone who's either a partner or more senior. So it's really just question of, are they sold on the product? But we've had a pretty easy time getting into them. For Experian, it was actually inbound, which is kind of funny, because we're completely in stealth. We have no website, but one of our, one of the partners at Andreessen, mentioned us to the head of North American ventures at Experian, and that person introduced us to their head of data, and that's how we got introduced to them. So it's really just, yeah, mapping out work charts and then selling individually to these buyers. And then once we have the buyer on board, we basically use that as a point of contact to then say, hey, all the people you're buying data from, like, make the introduction for us. And then we'll get we'll get you guys started with the with the product.

S Speaker 120:55Super interesting, Evan and you, you mentioned, say, not tying yourself down to one industry. How does that change? The product decisions that you take, do you are you say, Fine tuning the models for understanding financial data better? How does that change?

Yeah, luckily we this was kind of a this
S Speaker 221:16was a decision we made before we left our jobs like we basically said, we are not going to be a hedge fund Tool Company like the idea is much broader than that. Yeah. So the way that's factored in the product is because we do a lot of on prem or like VPC deployments, we are not fine tuning our own model. We're basically giving each individual client the ability to have like their own context be the one what is training the model. So we're pretty agnostic to industry and type of data. It doesn't matter if it's geospatial or credit card. It doesn't matter if it's like the financial use case or a healthcare use case. The context does most of the work for us. So it's really about can you get to the people who have this information and then build a structure around it that has like sophisticated enough rag and ability to pull in context well enough that you can answer questions very broadly?

Kevin and Evan, probably the last question on my end, I will need to do a little bit more scoping on my end, just to understand the market, the product, and flesh out the differentiation slightly better.

S Speaker 223:57So as I said, we've already been approved by the InfoSec at this hedge fund, so we kind of know how the deployment works. It's really not that strenuous. All that really is required is that we are deploying to a server that they manage. Beyond that, it's not that important. They just want to make sure that it's kind of a walled garden. Nothing is getting out. But other than that, the deployment has not been a sticking point for anyone. It does take a little bit for various security conscious firms, but as of now, has not really been something we've run into as an issue. Yeah, we also don't anticipate that being a major issue, because this first client was probably the most security conscious buyer that exists,
