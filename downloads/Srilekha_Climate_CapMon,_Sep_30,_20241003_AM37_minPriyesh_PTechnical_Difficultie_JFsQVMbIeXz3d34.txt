S Speaker 20:44I haven't seen this happen, but a bunch of other things have happened, so I'm not surprised. Do you? If I'll just drop a quick zoom link, let's, let's just join on that.

S Speaker 22:43It was we like suddenly I was looking at the YC companies. There are a few good prospects in there. And then there are a couple of companies I want to dig deeper into, one in the climate space, but turns out they recently closed around. It's a company called Ruby. It's a YC company, and they have their own ml algorithms to work with the grid and predict when to charge their batteries and when to discharge it. So they r, e, w,

S Speaker 13:16B, I, Ruby. Yeah, got it, okay, yeah, I think we were looking at YC companies too, and some one of the partners was in charge of, just like, shortlisting all the ones who interest. And looks like Ruby was on the list.

S Speaker 23:31Yeah, yeah, pretty interesting company and quite good founders, but they closed their seat round 4 million round a few weeks back, so I was a little bit late to the party.

S Speaker 13:41I yeah, I don't think we engage with them either. So wait, hold on, I think we already invested in a previous round for them. Oh, wow, that's a surprise. Yeah, no. Climate capital has a surprisingly large portfolio. We have like 400 plus portfolio companies, because they have so many different ways of deploying because they have, like, an index fund, which is micro checks, yeah, you have an SPV for, like, a syndicate of angel investors, and then they have two funds. So I feel like across all of these instruments, they've gathered a lot of companies. So I just want to know what, and it looks like we did invest in them previously through a small check size. But yeah,
I yeah, I don't think we engage with them either. So wait, hold on, I think we already invested in a previous round for them. Oh, wow, that's a surprise. Yeah, no.

S Speaker 24:31that's nice. How early is early for you guys? Like, How early do you guys get in

S Speaker 24:43to series. So with just a team and an idea and a deck, would you invest or would do you want an MVP?
to series. So with just a team and an idea and a deck, would you invest or would do you want an MVP?

S Speaker 14:53So as a fellow, what I do is I talk to people or look at ideas and promoting, facilitate internally, but when I look at the partners and how they do it, I feel like it's very relationship based, because if it's someone they know, and if it's deal flow coming from a trusted source, then they're more likely to look at it than just, you know, someone saying it's a good idea. But that being said, obviously I think it's both ways, like, if they find like, if they start thinking of strategy in a particular way, and find areas of interest. Then they look. They would look for companies in that area of interest. If it's just a deck and an idea, I think they would just pass it on to their deal flow like DL, and see if any of the angel like Angel investors and they care partners want to take it up. Yeah. So unless it's like something, something to make them pause and look at it more deeply, I feel like it just goes through that. And that's kind of where I try to pick up on things. So I try to look at other companies that are going through this just unfiltered deal, full list, attending events and things like that. So I think very specific things like YC or like hacks, where we met, they actually go through the website and the companies in detail. But I feel like otherwise, not necessarily.

S Speaker 26:12Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Otherwise, there's a lot of noise out there, so for sure, they have to filters. They have to have some filters out there. But that's great. Srilaka, I guess you seems like you're seeing a lot out there in the market. That's something I want to do, especially in the clean tech focus of ours. And like I mentioned the last time we were chatting, it's pretty new for us. We have made a few opportunistic investments here and there, but it hasn't been a strategy, and I'm working with one of the matching partners today, over the last few months, and trying to create a thesis over there. So feels like in that specific area, there'll be a lot of synergies, and we can really collaborate.

S Speaker 16:57I think post this fellowship, I'm looking for full time roles as well. So if you happen to build out a climate strategy team at Qualcomm, yeah, I'll be very happy to Oh,

S Speaker 27:14absolutely we will make sure we keep all the doors open. I just feel the climate strategy wouldn't be as big a focus for us. It's something that I'm pushing, and it turns out my managing director had an interest in it. So we might write a few checks, probably two or three over a year or so. But AI is where the team wants to be really focused at but I know a lot of good firms in climate tech. I had a background in here. So when I was recruiting, I really wanted to sort of also create a focus for climate funds. And I want, I was networking quite a lot with funds like that. So if anything around that pops up, I'd be happy to refer you.

8:00You wanna Yeah? Yes. Oh, sorry. Can you hear me now? Yes, I said I completely

S Speaker 18:03understand. Because, like, cvcs, you would want to keep to the company strategy. So that makes a lot of sense. That being said, I came across a link of AI related, I met, like, startups or something i i can't see right now, just looking for that, but one I do find that I can send it across, because that's a pretty like interesting intersection graphic. Yeah, it was a great infographic as well. Was it? Was it

S Speaker 18:34think so, yes, yes, yes, I saw the stage companies, not like early stage companies. So unless Qualcomm is specifically like, okay with doing I don't know, Series B, Series C, then, you know, I don't know if it's that relevant to us. Yeah,
think so, yes, yes, yes, I saw the stage companies, not like early stage companies. So unless Qualcomm is specifically like, okay with doing I don't know, Series B, Series C, then, you know, I don't know if it's that relevant to us. Yeah,

S Speaker 28:49for us, I think a series B, series A Series B would fly better internally in the team, especially because we don't have a lot of climate talent in in the within the team. So if the numbers are there to support it, it's usually an easier story to sell.

S Speaker 19:04Yeah, that being said, if you want to, like, I don't know, just brainstorm about any climate strategies that would be great, because I feel like that is something that is slightly harder to do now that I've kind of moved into the space a little more, I'm seeing clear differences with East Coast, West Coast. But also, you know, here, it's more individualistic, so I feel like you need to work harder to create, like, a pure network. It's not like, you know, you work for the same company, you have all these people who you can bounce ideas off of. Sometimes it just feels like you need to find out yourself more in this industry. So I've actually been reaching out to people and kind of setting up, like recurring chats, or, you know, these channels where we just have, like, idea jams or something. Oh yeah, this is what I'm looking at. Is very interesting. You know, what are your thoughts? Or,

S Speaker 29:58I don't know, absolutely, absolutely, and it was a little bit surprising to me, but more recently, I've sort of realized that a lot of associate, Senior Associate and partners have these circles going on, and they have recurring calls over the over, like probably every month or every two months. And it's also turns out to be one of the best, most filtered deal flow opportunities. So always happy to do that. I'm happy to set up something on our calendar, probably once a month, every time, and could discuss everything that we have come across over the month, how things are, looking at, what kind of friends we see, any good companies that could work well for either of our funds? Absolutely, that makes a lot of

S Speaker 210:47It does make sense, right at times, I do come across a lot of early stage companies that I just have to then push it onto my Excel sheet and put a monitor over there, and maybe down the line, it will become a prospect. But that could be something that would be way more exciting for you at this stage. So always happy to make those connections. I think we should do something like this for sure.

S Speaker 111:07Yeah, because I feel like, in some sense, we are definitely like a pure group. And I feel like looking at the people exactly as you start looking at the people who have actually successfully made it. They have actually made the effort to create these circles for themselves, even if it's not like a formal like, you know, have a meet up, you know, like women in climate or something, like people in climate or something it's, it doesn't have to be that formal. It just feels like they have, like, good connections, right?

S Speaker 211:46was just saying that I have this one, one more person, like a very close friend from UCLA. He's currently at elemental accelerator. Now they've shifted to elemental impact. So he also looks at right, so is he in New York? No, he's an SF I guess they also have an office here.

S Speaker 112:01Oh, I didn't know that. Okay, I met someone from elemental at as the clever way, but I guess you should be on because he gave me the impression that they mostly had operations in New York. Okay,

S Speaker 113:46I think one of the I started looking into it because one of our companies was like this vertically integrated electricity supplier that was trying to provide electricity, but also have a software that automates demand response and can train in real time. And so that got me thinking, like I need to understand a little bit more about this. So I think the key word you want to look for is energy imbalance markets. Because what happens there is, I think there are depending on the ISO or RTO. So do you know how like the RTO and ISO. I

S Speaker 114:34So, but while I'm finding, I'm just gonna keep, like, walking you through it. So yes, basically you have a very different grid set up here in the US, as you must know by now. And stop me if at any point this is obvious,

and I'm sure you like know some of this already, but
and I'm sure you like know some of this already, but
and I'm sure you like know some of this already, but
S Speaker 114:51I think what happens is, because they kind of opened up the energy markets to make it more competitive, you have some of these bodies that are just doing it themselves, along with the traditional utility companies. So you have, I think, three ISOs and four RTOS that exist right now. And ISOs and RTOs are these more independent bodies that want to try to be competitive and do it themselves. ISOs are basically RTOS, but RTOS have gone one step ahead in some kind of regulating process or capability. California has its own ISO ca ISO. New York has its own ISO and yso. And then there is one RTO, I think, in the Midwest, or something miso, which is also a pretty well known RTO.

S Speaker 215:33And I think Texas has something, yeah, yeah. So
S Speaker 115:36you have all of these blocks and sometimes to kind of balance the load, they also trade with each other, like they trade energy with each other. And I'm still looking into it, so I'll probably have a much more detailed explanation for this in our next call. But if I'm understanding this correctly, because you're not really an island, you're operating as a world country, you want to kind of, you know, not spend too much on infrastructure within your own region to over produce. Instead, you would kind of build infrastructure which is just enough and trade with other regions. And so you do, you kind of want to create this balance. So that's why they

S Speaker 119:40So the transmission capacity problem is still outlined. That problem is just there. And I think that's that's like a different topic. So we can revisit that once again through this. What you're saying is, what is the trading Exactly? That's something that I'm also trying to figure out. But it's not marketing like market trading is trading on the price of electricity. So that's going to be like commodities market, where you're like, trading on the price of electricity. So it's going to be like futures, derivatives, or, you know, whatever, commodities. So that's not what I'm referring to, although that is also its own thing. I think what I'm referring to is actual trading of energy. And if I'm not mistaken, because all of these systems are connected, you can actually just transfer energy from your region to that region. Got it, I think that's how it works. And based on what I read recently, there are two ways to do it. So one is day ahead, planning where you plan the next day based on a predictive model of how much energy is going to be used in your region. And the other, I think, is real time. But that's as far as I've gotten. Up and trying to dig even

S Speaker 121:29grid? So the great question is different from the parties question, yes, the commodities question is going to be it's actually it is definitely linked to energy, because that's like the underlying market that you're tracking, but that's more like a financial startup they're looking at training.

S Speaker 122:19a good question. I don't know, I think that's something that we could definitely look into. Would be very interesting. But what I do know is it's not going to be easy, because right now, one of the reasons for the blockage for transmission, transmission build out is simply permitting. That's like one of the one of the blockages. So you have so much of renewable energy available right now, and we're not able to put it on the grip simply because there's no transmission capacity. So I think our current usage is 1.5 terawatt or something. And in terms of availability renewable energy, it's like two terawatts. So it's like more than what already exists completely. And the entire electricity market in the US permitting is a problem, because now that the grid is very delicate, they are taking a longer time to keep assessing if this product is going to make or break, like, if it's going to break anything, it's going to be like the straw that broke the camel's back or something. So earlier, it used to be like a year to maybe two years. Now, I think it's four years. But recently, there was a regulation passed that's trying to, like, reprocess the whole thing. I definitely think that might have bearing on whether independent power producers and other viewers can easily, like, make themselves available to the market or, you know, get into the market themselves,

S Speaker 124:16not even going to be energy shading, like on the infrastructure side. It's going to be like commodities, energy sharing, yeah. And so I guess with the weather prediction, they can predict blackouts, brownouts, more effectively, spikes in utility prices, yeah.

And I came across the podcast I didn't listen to, but I came across the podcast by energy on the Kuma, like on the trading floor, who is dealing with derivatives and futures, with regards to, I think this. So maybe if you listen to that, it would give you a lot of like, straight from the horse's mouth. Oh, yeah. I'd

25:15absolutely love to look, look into that. Yeah. So
S Speaker 125:19do you? Do you still want that brief of, like, transmission capacity? Because I don't think that's related to this direct,

S Speaker 127:17that sounds really interesting. I've not looked into any company that's doing that's, I guess, building energy out of methearing. Not recently, at least, I did come across a company that's doing a lot of green hydrogen. I think it's called cytok Hydrogen pirates, and they are very interesting model, but they're in Germany, so I'm not, I'm not too familiar with how like prevalent it is there, how much of infrastructure they would need to kind of deliver that and but I do remember they had, like a circularity model that was very interesting as well.

S Speaker 130:41be Okay, interesting because I'm literally like digging deeper into batteries and transmission, these two things, I'm digging into more with more detail to try to have a stronger opinion about where I think this is going to go. And what would be interesting here. Absolutely,

S Speaker 230:59I'd make a note to send that to you. And when you say transmission capacity, are you looking at technologies which will make the current, current transmission capacity work, or optimize them or perform them better today? Or are you looking for technologies for new transmission capacity building? That's a great question

S Speaker 234:01that's that's very interesting. Srilaka, I guess the last layer that you mentioned about is something that is our primary focus at the moment, but 100% agree that I do need to understand the layers on top of it to really get to the core of the problem. There was this one company. It was in materials innovation for transmission line and their new material based transmission lines were way more optimum or cost efficient, and I know one of the good VCs invested in them. I'll find the name. I'll send it to you. I think it'll be interesting and parallely. I need to create my list of storage companies and send it to you. I'll send the report. You don't you don't have to do anything. I have it in Excel sheet, so I just have to pick out the right names in there, copy it all together and send it to

S Speaker 134:57I would just caution you to be careful, because in case that's something you're interested in, from like a corporate perspective, like you think you'll actually be investing in it, I would say, Just be cautious if you're distributing it to especially other VCs. But definitely,

S Speaker 236:22I don't know. It's the early days. So not a lot of companies who have gone from the from that 30 million era marked 100 million error, and that's where I guess the industry is a little bit cautious about. But yes, a lot of these companies are getting those early revenues pretty fast, the first $5 million that's pretty easy to come by. If there's a burden. Yeah, that's how we are seeing it Yeah, got it.
