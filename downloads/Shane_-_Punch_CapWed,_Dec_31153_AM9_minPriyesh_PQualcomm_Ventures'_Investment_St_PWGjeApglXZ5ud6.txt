S Speaker 10:00About two years prior to that, I was I spent some time with Menlo Ventures in Bay, and then some time with Morpheus ventures in LA I did my MBA from UCLA. So I had like, a lot of touch points with La VC funds as well. About Qualcomm ventures, corporate venture arm of Qualcomm, typically aim to deploy about 100 $50 million every year in US geography, and then we have offices across the globe, so quite open to investing in immigrant founders, most of the times, if they have already moved to the US, the US team sort of takes those deals, but if they are operating out of one of our global regions, we have global teams to work with them as well. So that's where I feel there would be a lot of overlap. Investing actively in AI, both infrastructure agents. That's where my focus area is, as well. Robotics, both the tech and hardware that goes behind it, IoT, industrial automation, automobile tech stack, anything around software as well. And then Shane from a strategic angle, corporate venture arm. So Qualcomm as a corporate has been expanding quite a lot across different platforms. So initially was a mobile plus networking player. Now we have our chipsets which go into robots. There is it. They go into PCs, they go into XR IoT. There's a cloud inferencing chip which competes with Nvidia and AMD. So a lot of platforms, and we feel a lot of companies. We meet either prospects portfolios. We can either sort of always evaluate Qualcomm as a customer, but at the same time also sort of bundle them, bundle software solutions along with our silicon go to the market together. Do some engineering partnerships, do some go to market partnerships. So a lot of say partnership proposition that the business units are also very actively evaluating right now. And then, yeah, quickly on the check sizes. Shane, so we prefer to come in around series A that's where I saw some of your emails with some active leads. Pretty amazing deals, such good founders, but they felt around early for us, we have done seed, and our check size, as low as it can go, would be roughly around 2 million. So we have done seed in when seed rounds are big, big, say, relatively seven to 10, kind of ballpark figure. And then check sizes can go from anywhere from two to 15 for us. So stage agnostic,

S Speaker 28:10At endpoint, we have an amazing intern who's really effectively systematized processes so we don't accomplish by Friday on execution, we have what's called side task Saturday, and this is somewhere in between, because it's relevant for a portfolio. Relevant for portfolio companies. I thought about going out to reliance, or reliance that billionaire out in India, yes, we have kind of an in I guess they're very active as far as CVC portfolio collaboration. So let's kick it off. We're going to send you an email or vice Yeah, we'll just take the initiative and do it. Send something your way so that we can thereafter. Well, if you want to skip us up, just send it to us. But ultimately, we're going to send it to our portfolio companies for them to determine, hey, do I want to call Qualcomm, you know, or not? Right? Absolutely. Yeah, sounds funny. That's amazing. I'm really looking forward to collaborating. Yeah. Sounds good your wife and really appreciate your
