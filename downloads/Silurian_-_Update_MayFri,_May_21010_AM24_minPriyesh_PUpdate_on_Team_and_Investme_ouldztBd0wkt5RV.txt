S Speaker 10:35spoke, I was still learning the team. So things have been good. So far, made a few investments role in the team. Looking forward to some more interesting prospects this year. I actually want to catch a bridge, because I am trying to create a thesis on physical AI. And my focus there would be one on Earth models, which I guess you are very clear in. So wanted to get some insights there. But at the same time, also look at some models which can power robotics, digital twin and simulation models, and any infrastructure companies in that space. Any infrastructure companies in that space which would be the makers for some of these models. So so broadly, wanted to chat around that front and at the same time maybe take a taken a great on salute in Tushar. And I, both of us, we still remain to be very excited about what you're building. So down the line, and there's another fundraising route we'd love to re evaluate that. And are you still in Seattle? Yes, okay, and you plan to be there, right? Yeah, we also have like Chris and did you do Okay, right? And the entire team is

S Speaker 11:41yeah, absolutely, I get that so great to be connected again. What? What is super interesting that I'd love to do, maybe an update on where you are today. I remember we were speaking, and you mentioned that you closed around you also joined total energies accelerator, right? And how has that been going for you? Total energies? May

S Speaker 21:58I be able to get data from their assets and be able to evaluate how our model performs actually locations where these things are. They know what their senses and we perform extremely managed compared to existing things. We working with them to kind of demonstrate how their data come into our model and improve forecasting performance for them in some ways, like personalization of these forecasts for their operational needs, but their training team has also been evaluating our general forecast as well, and they found it to be quite good compared to other things. Hopefully, we can get the pitch to the CEO, but very likely we should be able to convert them as like, not just as a pilot customer. They also have like, Texas presence, and they have, like, one of them was able to evaluate Texas. Again, we actually performed extremely well offshore was possible, but haven't been able to demonstrate a bunch of other things yet. But they're trying to pull those people in at least. The main thing with all these companies that we have done is very least. The main thing with all these

S Speaker 23:13they have different needs, but they have their own assets, like transition lines, everything else. They already have the marketing systems, but it's like, really like talking about positive transmission lines of damages and everything. So they invested on being able to forecast those things. So any for classic improvements are very valuable. So again, one that we would evaluate our existing models at those remote citing cellular perform extremely well, and we're going to target the process of demonstrating how we can leverage their data to improve forecasting performance. Their data to improve, like 10% improvements, like very early experiments, but they also have driven educators using APIs per month now. So

S Speaker 24:06us model, there's nothing like pre collaborative distribution forecast for shorter license in the US and we see a lot of interesting conversations because of this, US markets and something that we are working on, simplify market, good market. Basically the only the top thoughts can actually use metadata directly. That's what we learned most of the players in the US and work with power for test in Denver and whether they used to condition their strategy. Sometimes they're not actively directly using raw weather values. So again, working on demonstrating how you can just directly predict load and generate that will come over the next few months. Right?

S Speaker 14:41Very exciting. And then this is the question I had as well, like, from a thesis perspective as well, when we were talking initially, you mentioned that weather forecasting is a base layer, and GFP model is the base layer. But you can sort of in, let's say, traditional colloquial language. You can fine tune that model to target different industries across insurance, agriculture, yield forecasting, power forecasting, like you mentioned. How does that effectively work? Is that something that you plan to be targeting, where you see yourself being an infrastructure player and more people depending on top of it? How do you forecast that

S Speaker 25:10market to evolve? I think overall, the market is not very heavy, like, it's not like a large language, very simple tech stock already, large number of machine learning people kind of already being aware of like, being aware of, like, the high level principles of the problems to be solved this kind of telemarketers not like, that's going to be more enterprisey, I guess so. The thing is more like valid, and therefore it's not less of it for you to do a lot of those things. But it's very unlikely, like some third party is going to really solve it early on. It's very much possible that we're kind of building it in a way that these things generalize and become much more quickly to deploy. And there's obviously requirements for utilities in some of these folks as well. Like there are security places, but like a lot of the stuff that, like their data, doesn't even have to come to us today, like an edge compute aspect of it as well. But you kind of get partnership the model in a way that that is you that is so that's the kind of stuff that you're building. Customer stuff is slightly more work. It requires a lot less work. And that's what I would say, that you can generalize to other markets as well. It's the same underlying problem, just optimization objectives are different. And even for technical it's the same kind of problem they have their assets. They have this same kind of CSV kind of come in. But obviously the different like is more about some of the extreme events that they care about, or the transmission lines, as well as some of the general better things, the dispatch problem, like what happens to their devices without lands, and how its power they will generate in other things. So same the same foundation, whatever this kind of deal with the CSE and its sparse observational data and the same development process of evaluators. So for C being like a dev driven back, we will, like, have to at least build out the initial platform, but we're trying to build it. To build in a way that a lot of the stuff can be automated. The CSV policy. The same physics is happening everywhere. The same physical processes are being pointed. The objectives are different. Like, some people care about getting the wind drives. People care about this extreme event, like, really big, right? So we are users are sometimes the FTP or data. The back and forth happens on FTP. So then you can expect them to play very quickly machine

S Speaker 17:38so then in that case, the user persona that you would probably be selling to some of these adjacent markets would be like you mentioned, very non technical. And hence, a player like you would need to develop an end to end platform, not just for fine during the model, but also for them to use with the custom UI and things like that. That's how you think

S Speaker 19:56And again, in terms of data, what, and I'm early in terms of my research here, but what I realized is there are two ways models, and here I'm generalizing models. So this, these could be not common based llms as well, but two based models are trying to embed physics into their reasoning. One is more latent, one is more early fusion llms, I would say most of them have today. They're training it on a bunch of data, and expect the model to learn physics on its own from the training data, but I believe your approach would be more specifically, training the model on specific physics examples and giving the physics reasoning more early. Is that true? And do you see this approach differing between different kind of

S Speaker 210:38actually details that matter from a preferred perspective. You know what actually works in that space to like play input models and everything else matters. But a lot of details, many different ways of doing it will work, like the LLM space, like there are, nobody actually knows anymore, like, what the underlying models are decoded on the models, they assume this expert like what is actually happening. So somebody seems obviously like proper index on what is specific thing that is running right now? This is always an empirical thing, and you are always evaluating different approaches. But for us, it's kind of important to design the model in a way that you can take in your sources of data after the fact, basically not like retraining the full model again and again. You can design a way to design it in a way that you can kind of ingest like pathways for the model to take in this new data, process both as inputs but also as targets, so that that's kind of overall but I would not tell you when it backs on any particular model. Likely we still be transformer like things that work and generalize best, because we know how to scale those approaches, but the specific implementation, that's all a trade off about Compute and other resources you have,

S Speaker 111:55that's that's fair. Jayesh, thanks. Thanks for that. That saves me some time, probably going deep into a rabbit hole which which would not made sense. And in terms of data, again, Jayesh, I am assuming you probably trained the model focusing on some very specific variables which have, let's say, a high propensity to protect energy or weather forecast down the line.

How do you keep improving and solving the downstream not just coming in the RMS, etc, are fine, and we obviously are also doing that. Honestly, we should spend less time on that downstream. That's kind of what our focus is over the next few months, build out and showcase some of these power forecasting things on top. And we can? Yeah, we can. I see ourselves as like, this is a more general model. We are not a weather company. We were never a weather company. So whether it was a starting point where there's a ton of data and you can bootstrap a good model, but no, everybody cares about whether that the governments, I would say everybody cares about the weather only in terms of, like, how it impacts them.

And they're like, 10 forms that probably can make use of this valuable to them, but, yeah, everybody will probably get there, even if we do it. Yeah, so we are. I mean, we are. We have some internal things there, but, like, we're trying to target something which will last longer. And we're always more interested in the infrastructure space itself, like, how does it actually impact the infrastructure? But we do have digital customers, they are using the API.

S Speaker 221:30what the market is. Should we do it now? When or should we, yeah, like, again, hit some of the revenue milestones and other things like, but I think overall targeting, let's see how some of these, how long it takes for the permissions, for the total and recovery stuff to be released. At least, we'll also have our nature, actually, the COVID paper coming out in nature next month. So we kind of will probably consider like, if it makes sense to like start,

S Speaker 123:41assumption? Yeah, yeah. Many other times internally with the fund as well, we, we are, I would say, a little bit less opportunistic, in the sense that, if we come across a great team and we really want to invest, do anything, don't understand the market, do we take that risk? So I believe if I am able to go through this thesis as well, this will be enough of a knowledge material research inside the team that we will be able to make that sort of it so that should have to change some of the things internally.
