S Speaker 33:27to read the article, just because, anyway, we can actually leverage the article to replace the founder. It turns out seven four seats here, three from investors, four from company and but this is four seats the funder actually has the right to appoint them. So that was happening back to 2016 actually, at that time, it still is our CEO Summit, september 30, we last day, and all the board realized, okay, we actually the board convinced the three main team to vote to replace the founder, but the founder actually has the right to appoint the new guys. So we start to move on. September 30, the whole board meeting and with the students send seats on the board seats actually agreed on to replace the founder. That's done, and that board meeting is really, really not happy once, because within that meeting, for 20 million support keeps saying, No, I don't know, keep saying that repeatedly, but fortunately we get it done, and we spin up that that business and that business originally, one day we can exit fortunately on that and that company, and we act up by the worry street cash control policies, so we just let COVID now. So first of all, our group data, CEO, we also put a sample Genesis, okay, you have to have full cash expansion every month for any expense over, I mean, accumulated over 4000 400,000 or cut

S Speaker 35:19Yeah. So first of all, you know, because when the two partners have kind of conflict, and the first thing you you learn this one is the trust that produced you, and result is almost zero, which means it's two partners cannot work out together anyway, cannot. So we have to wait up one, number one, so and number two is you need to figure out the mechanics
Yeah. So first of all, you know, because when the two partners have kind of conflict, and the first thing you you learn this one is the trust that produced you, and result is almost zero, which means it's two partners cannot work out together anyway, cannot.

5:42and how to replace
S Speaker 35:44and you have to move really fast, because if we wait for another one today, the funder will appoint new three guys on the scene, and the whole thing got to have to make decisions before they happen. I hold more meeting, a good example. So long learning.

S Speaker 36:07to we keep so if something anything, not between funders, but between board members, if you figure out there is sometimes a conflict about coupling is really deep for the materials, and first you have to do this. You evaluate the trust that will come on this to the parties, whether the question is whether you can keep working together or not. If not, that means you have to replace one, and you choose a side, and you talk to other COVID First, whether, and you think the winning side is really important. But sometimes you think maybe for me, I think the father is good. My best friend, a good friend, was here, but turns out, okay, he cannot win, right? So if you win inside and you read articles, try to find your dependence on how to make things legal and ethical faculty, and then you

The key point is, if we can earn two or three more days, the situation will be different, because it's too severe, and the board felt like, oh, people are in the founder side.

One, founders getting breakfast, one founders, husband, wife getting me in a funny situation. And you've spoken about Qualcomm, but these are sort of gray. But the more obvious ones is when a company has cash crunch, right? And how do we as a board observer, with limited voting rights, you know, control that situation?

S Speaker 719:10maybe I'll leave with the punch line, as far as best practices go, from at least my perspective as a as a Qualcomm person, I think probably the best practice is don't be a board member. It's

S Speaker 719:28always fun to leave with the punch fund. But I think that, you know, that's mainly it. You know, servios, like all cash constrained situations, are always unique situations. I think you know, one of the potential learnings from it, as far as even before getting into the investment is, you know, really understanding the investor base and the board as well. Probably most of our portfolio companies and brain included, were also important. I guess you know when you're leading up to a cash crunch situation, challenge at the board level, and kind of coming up with the right game plan is understanding who else is around the table and their pressure points as well. So in Servius case, very competent board members was Lux, Shasta, and then a strategic place, which was MGM, Amazon.

We would have a separate conversation with Team okay and the prune to understand what from prune understand what their true priority is, to build the telemetry solution for the CPE moments, and
So that's one example, yeah. And for photo companies, I think in Chrome's case, I think that's another example.

S Speaker 931:57you. And on the second part, strategic positioning, a few locations, for example, data, power go sci fi, I found out when we because we see so many different companies across the industry, across different sectors, and also more on the on the cutting edge of seeing this AI In regions, but for companies, there is down executing, yeah, they are not aware of the broader ecosystem. So when we bring the information and knowledge into that, into the ballroom and talk about positioning, how they align themselves, how they you know, like, for example, in safaris case, there are so hands down during their IP they don't see them. So one time I made a suggestion. Say, Hey, there's so many ai coddies, right? So why not? We've applied some AI coding techniques into the front and this process because they use these two sort of program, right? They pride themselves for being 10 times more efficient. Then they actually say, Hey, you actually write up. And this is something they already thought about, but I would never really seriously think

you. And on the second part, strategic positioning, a few locations, for example, data, power go sci fi, I found out when we because we see so many different companies across the industry, across different sectors, and also more on the on the cutting edge of seeing this AI In regions, but for companies, there is down executing, yeah, they are not aware of the broader ecosystem. So when we bring the information and knowledge into that, into the ballroom and talk about positioning, how they align themselves, how they you know, like, for example, in safaris case, there are so hands down during their IP they don't see them. So one time I made a suggestion. Say, Hey, there's so many ai coddies, right? So why not? We've applied some AI coding techniques into the front and this process because they use these two sort of program, right? They pride themselves for being 10 times more efficient.

They're diluted too early. So I just make a comment to them, saying that, guys, we need to solve this. I invest or not, it's a different thing. It's for your own good to figure out how you gonna work with your board and investors, right? Figure out the milestones inside some right? So two instances that happen later, much later, one company is getting to a unicorn. One of the events, he came to me and said, That was a great advice. And then, more recently, another founder came back and said, Thank you for that advice, because I have not solved this problem. Now he's raising funds, and say, Would you be interested?

I've seen what I'll give, a simple example company where we could have worked very dangerous chipset. They have, they sit on the OBD port. They then they have 60 TV of data on, you know, IC engines, very relevant for Qualcomm. Brought it in November. I mean, till April, we didn't get a response, right? And now they have a term sheet from Tiger. There's no chance we could enter it.

Of course, before we do it by the price, right? The chipset price, we try want to let them to use the Qualcomm price, or Qualcomm chip. But sometimes the price too high, but sometimes we do it by ad hoc, right? We have them to negotiate, but I'm not sure whether we can leverage the whole team, right? Maybe aggregated the volume, or even aggregate the influence to negotiate some kind of program. Otherwise, the QC startup, you can entitle some kind of the discount.
