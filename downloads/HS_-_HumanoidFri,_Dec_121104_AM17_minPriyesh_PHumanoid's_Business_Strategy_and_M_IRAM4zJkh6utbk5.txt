S Speaker 13:19the wheel alpha, the alpha, as mentioned, made particular for the industry, for the clients in the industry and manufacturing space. And they're talking about different things, right? We heard some topics like safety, obviously, that's clear and important. You don't want to have an unsafe robot next to your coworkers. They predominantly talk about TCO, total cost of ownership of our ROI. That's super crucial, and this is exactly what we are trying to deliver. Hence, a couple of product decisions have led to exactly that design you see here, a real platform. Why? It's stable, it's reliable, right? And it's certifiable, right? Which is not the case for bipedal so far. Also, we're added some sort of superhuman capabilities. So this is really a huge rod, two meter, 20, you know, and the reach is even higher. The payload right now 15 kilograms, but it's only a starting point. From there, we obviously go higher. And the bipedal on the right hand side today is mostly our r&d platform for us. We don't want to miss out, because 80, 85% of the use cases out there today can be solved with the wheel platform, right? We could even go so far and send a wheel platform into Lyft, right? AMRs today, they're part of center, but we don't want to miss out, and hence also continue the development on the bipedal our product roadmap looks like this. Everything started in q2 actually this year with the pre alpha that was off the shelf, hardware screwed together, while the team just focused on AI and software, part of things, and very early POCs already. This is something we're doing differently than many other players out there. We are very customer focused and commercial focused. We didn't want to drop a product three years after the company was founded, and then realized there's no product market fit. We really could nearly co develop that with clients. We are right now on Alpha, as shown before, 12 units around are built. By the end of the year, we should reach the 15th, also on the bipedal the first two we have out there, or three, sorry, we have out there. And then next year, actually, a big milestone is coming with our beta platform, which is the first certifiable robot we're bringing out to the wine. And from there you see like startup production and MS, and also like the volumes getting up. Yeah, we talked about industry soaked in a bit more on the product itself and the robot itself. So what are we actually doing? Speed needs focus, and today we see incredible demand and excitement, particularly in manufacturing and the logistics area, where we are heavily focused on today with all sorts of use cases we are doing there, from material handling to assembly support or tool based operations, kidding in the logistics part de palatizing, sortation, all kinds of things in that area, and we bring out the skills, actually over four phases. Let me simplify, maybe describe a bit of information here phase one. Think about it like very simple use case. You bring a big box from A to B, right? While phase four is more targeting human parity, right? So we are adding here, or we can manipulate here, also small parts like a computer chip, right for example, or we can manipulate and work with soft objects like cables or towels and do inspections and have product maintenance and so on. Today, we're in phase two as a company. That means we can do all the object manipulation static, but also doing the first dynamic ones, where you take a box from a conveyor. For example, we do machine feeding. We've just done and delivered the very first project to a big OAM in that space, which was fascinating. We're working on our first machinery, operating like pulling a huge lever, switching 1000s of kilowatt with that, and avoiding arc sparks and so on. So it's a safety use case here, and then next year, entering in the first half, also phase three. This is our customer journey. So how do we serve clients? How do we try to create value for them? With them,
