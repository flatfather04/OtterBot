S Speaker 10:31I am doing? Well, just a heads up, there was a an emergency at daycare today, so I had to pick up my two and a half year old daughter. Yeah, he's busy and calm right now, but that could change at any moment. So appreciate any patience.

but that's where we are right now. Yeah,
S Speaker 24:06and I'm very early in the process, so I'm very sorry if I cannot give you a very broader context over here. I mean, you were very upfront
and I'm very early in the process, so I'm very sorry if I cannot give you a very broader context over here. I mean, you were very upfront

S Speaker 14:12with that. I figured it was just the time to just get a little bit of an idea what you were doing. And then I can give you the high level overview of Spike, and then we can see if next step makes that next steps make sense at that point. Yeah, I'm sorry, trying, trying to focus here.
with that. I figured it was just the time to just get a little bit of an idea what you were doing. And then I can give you the high level overview of Spike, and then we can see if next step makes that next steps make sense at that point. Yeah, I'm sorry, trying, trying to focus here.

S Speaker 24:54So we're talking to Jua, which is an European player. We are talking to klimavision, and I am supposed to reach out to probably Jupiter and a couple more players in my list, but I haven't done those reach outs yet. Yeah,
So we're talking to Jua, which is an European player. We are talking to klimavision, and I am supposed to reach out to probably Jupiter and a couple more players in my list, but I haven't done those reach outs yet. Yeah,
So we're talking to Jua, which is an European player. We are talking to klimavision, and I am supposed to reach out to probably Jupiter and a couple more players in my list, but I haven't done those reach outs yet. Yeah,
So we're talking to Jua, which is an European player. We are talking to klimavision, and I am supposed to reach out to probably Jupiter and a couple more players in my list, but I haven't done those reach outs yet. Yeah,
S Speaker 213:50made. Absolutely, yeah, I was recruiting. Is only increasing.

S Speaker 217:13Jeffrey on that point. So the high resolution models that you have today, which are doing well for this for the six day time period. Are those physics based models, or are those AI models? Yeah, okay,
Jeffrey on that point. So the high resolution models that you have today, which are doing well for this for the six day time period. Are those physics based models, or are those AI models? Yeah, okay,
Jeffrey on that point. So the high resolution models that you have today, which are doing well for this for the six day time period. Are those physics based models, or are those AI models? Yeah, okay,
Jeffrey on that point. So the high resolution models that you have today, which are doing well for this for the six day time period. Are those physics based models, or are those AI models? Yeah, okay,
S Speaker 117:26yeah. They're physics based numerical other prediction models, just the standard, old stuff. So, right? But yeah, we, like I said, it's just, you know, we don't have the the data to train those on. There are a few small areas I think I saw over Japan, they were doing pretty good, but it's just there's way too many data gaps in the US. I mean, I like to go tornado chasing, and I live in Minnesota, yeah. And when I'll go out west, you'll be in areas where you don't see anything on radar really, right? It's the radar beam is 25,000 feet in the air, and you know the rotation that's going to catch the top of the storm, but there's so much of the storm underneath that that you're missing so and then in the winter, you'll see snow. It won't even show up on the radar, because the top of it's a 10,000 feet. So you won't see the snow show up on radar until it gets within 5050, miles of the radar. But, you know, there's snow everywhere, but you don't know that. You can't train the models just because the data isn't there. So you know, climate vision is doing some really cool work with the radars that they have, maybe filling in the gaps eventually, but I would imagine there's still at least 10 years and a billion dollars short of actually plugging all of the gaps that they'll ultimately need to get. But as a meteorologist, I'm excited about what they're doing as well. I think every weather company just niche. Why? Like, we all have our own niches, and they're we're all doing some cool stuff out there. So it's competitive market. It's fun to play it. That's
yeah. They're physics based numerical other prediction models, just the standard, old stuff. So, right? But yeah, we, like I said, it's just, you know, we don't have the the data to train those on.

S Speaker 218:42a very interesting thought, Jeffrey, and maybe I have a question for you as a meteorologist, would you say that data lacking is the biggest sort roadblock currently for these AI models to develop that high resolution accuracy, accuracy? Or I have come across some of these very early stage companies super early, so they wouldn't really be a partner target for us, but these guys do promise to be high resolution, AI native for and targeting energy trading to start with. How do you think about them? It

How do you think about them? It
S Speaker 119:19is data, yeah, it's compute. It's combination of those two things. It's it's very expensive to get your hand on the computer. And it's also the data. What a lot of other companies are doing now, which there's some shady stuff going on, is that they're saying that it's an AI model, yeah, when, in reality, the bones of the model are a numerical weather prediction model, right? And then they put AI on top of it, yeah, so they call it an AI model, but it's not an AI model. It's a numerical weather prediction that you know, it's almost more the classical sense of machine learning, where you're post processing and refining it from what the numerical weather prediction model tells you, and you can use AI to try to figure out what's wrong with it. But nobody is using a high resolution model today that is strictly AI, right? It's always numerical weather prediction with some AI layered on top of it. So it's not a lot of these people are in AI models, and you can dig deeper into that. I don't want to throw any shape, but, yeah, that's the data is the biggest issue. Got it, but then compute, yeah, I mean, how many 10s of millions of dollars is it going to take to train a lot of these models? That's why we're these models? That's why we're so lucky with Nvidia. If we're going to pull out our own checkbook to do this, it would be so expensive. And I think I probably shouldn't say this, but our general manager, Mike IELTS, he's been in the space forever. He said what Nvidia is essentially doing is giving us cocaine for free for 30 days, and then they're gonna cut us off and then, you know, we're gonna have to come back. They obviously have a vested interest in that. If everyone's using these AI models, well, they're gonna need GPUs to run it all. So I think that's why Nvidia has a lot of skin in the game to kind of partner with a lot of folks to bring them into the environment. Yeah. And then once we're in, we're, you know, there's no going back
is data, yeah, it's compute. It's combination of those two things. It's it's very expensive to get your hand on the computer. And it's also the data.

And then once we're in, we're, you know, there's no going back
S Speaker 221:00and with Nvidia, you mean the Nvidia, Stormcast and Earth models, is that the team you're talking about

S Speaker 226:36Jeffrey, just because we are nearing the end of the time, and I do have to run at one. I would love to understand a little bit more about the pricing. What kind of business model you have around the pricing? Is it usage based? And typically, how does, how would like the fixed cost look like there?
Jeffrey, just because we are nearing the end of the time, and I do have to run at one. I would love to understand a little bit more about the pricing. What kind of business model you have around the pricing? Is it usage based? And typically, how does, how would like the fixed cost look like there?

S Speaker 126:53Yeah. So typically, the way it works is it's the geographic size of the area that you're looking at paired with what you're planning to do with the data, right? If you're going to use derivative products, if you just want to, like, redistribute it, stuff like that, that, that will all factor into it. So you're planning on taking the data, I'm guessing it's a derivative product, where you're going to use the data that we have, you're going to do your own data science, yeah, and you know stuff behind the scenes, then you're going to sell that to your customers as a way to pretty much do everything that you know. Did any of these stick out to you here, these five things over here, like, you know, wind energy, solar energy, electricity demand, stuff like that. I
Yeah. So typically, the way it works is it's the geographic size of the area that you're looking at paired with what you're planning to do with the data, right? If you're going to use derivative products, if you just want to, like, redistribute it, stuff like that, that, that will all factor into it.

Did any of these stick out to you here, these five things over here, like, you know, wind energy, solar energy, electricity demand, stuff like that. I
S Speaker 227:36think wildfire risk, solar and wind energy production would be our focus areas. Yeah, yeah.
think wildfire risk, solar and wind energy production would be our focus areas. Yeah, yeah.
think wildfire risk, solar and wind energy production would be our focus areas. Yeah, yeah.
think wildfire risk, solar and wind energy production would be our focus areas. Yeah, yeah.
27:43Gotcha write those down,
Gotcha write those down,
Gotcha write those down,
Gotcha write those down,
S Speaker 127:48yeah. So those would be the big things I got to get my product manager on before I do that. It just it varies a lot depending on your specific use application, and they don't give me the keys to the car. So you know when the time is right, when you know more about what you're going to do, we can get a mutual NDA signed absolutely, you know, kind of open up the conversation without having to worry about that. And then we can figure it out it is three, so you have to run. Do you have a timeline when it would make sense to, you know, really kick off this evaluation, or when you're going to dive in deep?
yeah. So those would be the big things I got to get my product manager on before I do that.
