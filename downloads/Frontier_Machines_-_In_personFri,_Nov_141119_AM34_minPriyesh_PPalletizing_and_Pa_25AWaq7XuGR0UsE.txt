S Speaker 10:00Not palletizing, but they are working at the size of boxes. So the packaging line was already done. Yeah, there's stuff in a large box. Now it's in a truck. So what they're doing is like somebody already palletized, put it in a truck. They'll unload, unload, or they will load the truck. So that's still like on the other side of the packaging line, vast majority of labor in most companies is doing before end of life, from

0:27the end of the line to pallets, yeah,
the end of the line to pallets, yeah,
the end of the line to pallets, yeah,
the end of the line to pallets, yeah,
S Speaker 10:29before palletizing, yeah. So putting this in boxes, got it, got it right, so
before palletizing, yeah. So putting this in boxes, got it, got it right, so
before palletizing, yeah. So putting this in boxes, got it, got it right, so
before palletizing, yeah. So putting this in boxes, got it, got it right, so
0:34that that's still folding boxes and everything, right?
that that's still folding boxes and everything, right?
that that's still folding boxes and everything, right?
that that's still folding boxes and everything, right?
S Speaker 10:37Yeah, yeah. And so, for example, like this customer site, like, they'll have like, 10 people on the line. I'd say one person is just like a line lead, nine people, seven of them, are doing before end of line work. Two people in the end are making the big box, putting it on a pallet and the palettes ready. Forklift guy comes and takes it. So So now how much labor spend is attributed to before end of line work that you just couldn't do before. Why? Because rule based robotics. The second is, what's the cost of the robot to the customer? So if you run two three shifts,
Yeah, yeah. And so, for example, like this customer site, like, they'll have like, 10 people on the line. I'd say one person is just like a line lead, nine people, seven of them, are doing before end of line work.

The second is, what's the cost of the robot to the customer? So if you run two three shifts,
S Speaker 21:15so this robot is doing at the end of the line, this robot is doing what all? Yeah. So there's, so we have a

S Speaker 11:35does, then the second somebody does is takes a tube out of a box and puts an Earth in there. Okay, then it goes towards, like, then there are people who, like, put six of these, yeah, one person doing this, okay, one person's putting this, okay. Then there's two people putting tablets inside this, okay. There's another person who's closing the lid, okay, and there's another person then who puts, I mean, these are new tubes, but they'll print a lot code here, all products without put it in a certain orientation, okay? It will then go from there. Lot code gets printed, okay? Another guy takes a bunch of these tubes, puts it in a larger box, okay, that box goes on a pallet, right? And so we can automate tube opening. Put the tube on the thing, yeah, put these tablets in the tube, and we let one person do a combination of QA plus Qa plus put it on a thing to do lot code, oh, there's also a step where you apply a circular sticker on the side when the thing is sealed.

S Speaker 12:55you look at the line right now, let's say this is the line products flowing from here to here. There's one person standing here, there's like another person standing here, then there's two people standing here. So essentially,
you look at the line right now, let's say this is the line products flowing from here to here. There's one person standing here, there's like another person standing here, then there's two people standing here. So essentially,

S Speaker 13:13those, you go from 10 people on the line to four people on the line. Yeah. Plus, let's say six to eight robots. Okay. The robot costs 20,000 a year for a customer, costs us to make 10k even if this thing lasts for us three years, eventually, these things will last 60k lifetime value, 10k bomb, we have line of sight to making for less than 10 it's the 10k bomb that's a huge deal. Robots have never been mentioned. These robot arms are 3000 Yes, and we're talking to a company right now that will sell. No, I think I mean the man.

S Speaker 14:10ROI and a lot of that is basically integration cost. Integration cost in the past has been very high because of all these asterisks. Well, the robot cannot do that. So I need a little sensor here. I need a little machine here, right? And that a lot of that gets addressed by the fact that generative models handle diversity. One simple example of that is, what if I'm taking these bags off pretty traditional robotics wouldn't be able to deal with but with enough data, you can train these arms to, just like, handle those things. So, but the key thing is low integration cost, because you don't need permanent fixtures.

S Speaker 15:40ask is a will end to end learning work? That's one fundamental question. Yes, somebody might say, like, I don't believe in that, right, right now, the best example of end to end learning in the real world is FSD. I don't know if you've tried the latest version, but it's crazy. It'll take a wide lot of data. Then the second question is, When will generalized end to end learning work, and when will overfitted End to End learning? What we are essentially saying in the near term is just overfit to a task that is immediately a valuable product, so we limit the diversity the robot looks at and the robot just as is one thing at a station that's a skill. And if you think about it, that level of diversity is even less than the diversity some AI software agent has to face all these things. And so the variety is like, okay, these things are in various different orientations, right? Maybe the conveyor sometimes is slightly differently placed, but it's not like there's a table randomly someday, right, which is the kind of diversity of self driving cargo. And so if you collect data, train a model to do that one thing, and then you follow that up with reinforcement learning for that one task, one skill that will work the earliest that lets you go to market. You still build a data set towards more generality, and what you avoid is we will do tech development for 10 years.

S Speaker 18:22their whole idea is they will build a foundation model that will just work everywhere. And theoretically, I agree that'll happen at some point, right? Is it going to happen in four years? I don't think so. You don't absolutely not. Yeah. Again, right? Like, think about how long Tesla has been collecting data, and that thing still needs some intervention. So the collecting data would be, yeah? Like, think, look, chat, GPT is great. It makes a lot of mistakes, and we just forgive it, right? But you don't forgive that mistake in a robot, right? Like, it's not okay for a robot just drop eggs on your kitchen floor and be like, All right?

but it'll take a while.
S Speaker 19:12If I were them, the thing I would be concerned about is, even when a model is sort of ready for people to use, and let's say they do their own fine tuning. On top of that, their revenue is gated by physical deployments. Where are the physical deployment are? This is going to let system integrators do it. And if they do that right, then all the issues with like, my robot arm is not long enough, it cannot pick up enough payload. Like, is that going to get figured out? Then that's going to take a few years to get figured out right. You don't just build a better robot arm and one money. So I feel like companies going to market early will collect data anyway. The data is more valuable because the data is actual in our case, it's actual data that the robots expected to see when it's running, as opposed to, I have a warehouse in China where, like, fold a lot of clothes. I don't feel like physical intelligence right now is like renting everything kind of representative. But, like, is this still a messy house because kids left boys on the floor. It's not right, it's it's different the so we will collect data over time. Anyway, you make revenue. The big benefit of that is, whenever there's a funding winter in robotics, the difference will be which companies have built a business, yeah? And on the other other side of that, you know, we will have collected real data, yeah, we understand customer needs. So, for example, we already know that these arms for a lot of cases may not be long enough, yeah, and that needs to be fixed now. And it's not okay to do teleoperation, and you, you're doing data collection in this hemisphere, yeah, and you show up at a customer side, and they're like, Well, no, like, you need to put three products in a bag. So three products need this much reach. That's too late to find that out. So you find that out. Talk to contract manufacturers, set up the supply chain. When you go from 10 robots to 50 robots to 100 robots, right? That makes for a much better machine to then keep improving the model and deploying robots four or five years from now. And so my main concern with those approaches would be, it's a very Go big or go home thing, if it somehow works magically, and then
If I were them, the thing I would be concerned about is, even when a model is sort of ready for people to use, and let's say they do their own fine tuning. On top of that, their revenue is gated by physical deployments. Where are the physical deployment are? This is going to let system integrators do it. And if they do that right, then all the issues with like, my robot arm is not long enough, it cannot pick up enough payload. Like, is that going to get figured out? Then that's going to take a few years to get figured out right. You don't just build a better robot arm and one money. So I feel like companies going to market early will collect data anyway.

this kind of stuff, it doesn't Right. Like, again,
S Speaker 212:32they're more dynamic than one home robot. This kind of stuff is like you already know, yeah, and also like you already know the 15 things that will go
they're more dynamic than one home robot. This kind of stuff is like you already know, yeah, and also like you already know the 15 things that will go
they're more dynamic than one home robot. This kind of stuff is like you already know, yeah, and also like you already know the 15 things that will go

S Speaker 112:41wrong. Yeah, if you, if you put a lower bound on customer size, so if they're making, let's say, 10 million of revenue already, which is like, like, I don't know there's, like, something like 30,000 companies in the US and factoring sector, then make more than 10 million of revenue that size. You've already specialized labor. You've already thought about operations. You're not running like a chaotic thing. You already have thoughts are like, no, no, I have to have these people do just one thing they don't if they think they slow down my line, right? And so that world is already set up for the person to not think you almost actively want to avoid that, because that reduces throughput. And when labor is expensive, you want to maximize throughput per person, because eventually it boils down to like, Okay, what cut Am I getting per tube when I sell this to this customer, which gets sold in a target. And so that's the idea. Like reasoning, in that sense, it's largely in the short term, like a waste of time in the industrial world, home robots. I don't think so. Maybe it matters. But again, that approach is very much like we'll wait eight to 10 years and see how it goes, which is fine, right? Like if they can finance it at first. But how many of those kind of self driving car efforts
wrong. Yeah, if you, if you put a lower bound on customer size, so if they're making, let's say, 10 million of revenue already, which is like, like, I don't know there's, like, something like 30,000 companies in the US and factoring sector, then make more than 10 million of revenue that size.

S Speaker 115:15company will also migrate. So there's no winning here, right? Like at the end of the day, either robots have to work in industry, and they're going to grow like B to B, SAS, it won't. So there's a certain expectation that some people have from this kind of robotics, like, it's just not going to grow like software. Flip side is that it's very, very resilient revenue. When you deploy 50 robots at a customer say they're not going to get rid of that over a month, assuming they work?

S Speaker 120:13seed, like, what, 8 million so, and think about it this way, like, I think we have to do three things in the next 24 months. Yes. One is, we have to complete a couple pilots, which is just like a few robots. It's fine, yeah, few robots, few tasks. The second thing immediately is like, if we complete the pilot with this customer, we've already given them a quote for a full time. And full line. And they, in some sense, the reason why they like do the pilot is because they're like, Oh, you can save me 40% in labor costs on the full line. That's going to be roughly two robots. That's a 200k like that. Then we want to deploy this across multiple lines we have. This customer is a private equity portfolio company. Other portfolio companies of that parent, pe firm, are very similar, medium sized customer. A lot of work. So the three things we have to do is a couple pilots. Let's say 10 robots, and then, let's say 50 to 100 robots, 50,000 robots puts us in one to 2 million revenue range. Yes, the question is like, at what, at what stage do we raise a Series A, technically hardware company. We can raise a Series A, if you can say you have 200k revenue,

S Speaker 121:57there, okay, so. But those are the milestones, yes, and then, and at that time, when we have one to 2 million of revenue, then you have maybe three customers, then you basically, we get the claim that it's not that we have a product, POC, that's promising technology. Then we say, now we are going to distribute this. And at that point, we say, we're talking about system ingredients. We understand how much of a cut we need to give them to sufficiently incentivize them while we still make margins, and we will, like, build that network and let them go do things with employment
there, okay, so.

We understand how much of a cut we need to give them to sufficiently incentivize them while we still make margins, and we will, like, build that network and let them go do things with employment
