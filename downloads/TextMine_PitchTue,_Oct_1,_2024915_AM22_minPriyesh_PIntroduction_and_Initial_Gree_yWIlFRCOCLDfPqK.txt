S Speaker 20:40were very grateful. KTM so grateful.
S Speaker 10:45I'm glad it worked out. So you guys are based out of London, is it? And what's the time there right now?

S Speaker 10:59Well, that's great team. So I believe I came across text mind during the New York Conference. I was not able to be there in person myself, but it ended a conference virtually. And would love to know more about what you guys are building. If there is any possibility for call commenters to support you and to start our conversation, I guess I can give you a brief background about myself and the fund here, how we operate, and we'll then pass it over to you to take it from there. How does that sound? Absolutely and let me know if you have any other questions for me. But broadly, I'm priyesh. I work here as a senior associate. I have I'm one of the newest members of Team. I've been with the team for about eight months now. Prior to that, I was working with mango ventures for some time, and then Morpheus ventures prior to that. And I'm originally from India, so during my time there, I've worked with a lot of startups early stage across different industries. Loved entrepreneurship quite a lot and moved to the US to pivot into venture. So I've been in venture for about two and a half years now. As a fund, we have been around for more than 25 years. We currently have 250, plus active portfolio companies in AI, IoT, industrial automation, computer vision in AI, both the infrastructure, tooling and application stack. So we invest. Our spectrum is quite broad. We invest out of the balance sheet of Qualcomm, but our mandates are quite independent of that. So we operate as a financial fund in that sense, typically in the US. We aim to invest somewhere between 150 $280 million a year and then we are a global team. So we have offices in London, in China, India, Israel, Latin America and us. And I believe if the if the company is based out of London, we will have to down the line route it through our London team. So I will have to make that connection going forward, but always happy to take that introductory call and then pass it on to the glow or regional team from there on. Thanks

S Speaker 13:12very quickly. One thing I didn't mention, our check sizes are roughly between two to 10 million that's where we try to come in at we are, preferably a Series A investor, but we with AI. We are doing seed opportunistically, if that makes sense for the team.

S Speaker 23:46Charles background in engineering in France. And, yeah, we started the company four and a half years ago where we basically were frustrated with, you know, how data was tracked and contracts, and we looked at applying knowledge graphs to tracking this data. And really, in the past year, we've been applying our own large language models to the extraction of data. So really, although we've been, you know, really building a lot of domain expertise with contracts for the past four years, we only really launched in March this year, and we've sort of broadened our scope also to include other documents that enterprises deal with. So this can be statements of work, invoices. It can also be KYC documents, so really a broad range of use cases, but yeah, fundamentally, we're using our own models. So our product

S Speaker 34:47has we have three products under our platform. We have a data extraction platform. We have a document creation and a Template Management solution. So the data extraction piece essentially what it does it ingest documents. So these could be legacy documents, ingest it, and it then extracts the key data point. So that varies between document type, whether it's an invoice or contract or just a document. The template generation piece, essentially it structures unstructured documents from inception. So from day one, you can embed a smartphone within the document. So when you are creating it, you can stipulate which parts of the document can be to be edited by junior team members. And then we have the Template Management solution, which essentially allows you to create and send out documents for signature, but also look at all your documents within your teams and across your business at scale, so you can look at, say, 1000 documents, and ask the model to essentially sift through all these documents and extrapolate the documents that are due to expire in the next Three months, and answer similar questions, such as, that got

S Speaker 26:47Yeah, sure. So on the technical front, yeah, we're taking foundational models, which we're fine tuning and self hosting. But I'd say what we've found is that to get you know, foundational models to do what our business users need. Obviously, there's a huge amount of fine tuning, so in terms of we've got over 100,000 records that we've labeled in house, but there's also, you know, additional parts of the process, especially around data standardization, so that it's in the right format. And also, it's not just using LLM, sometimes it's also using computer vision models, OCR. Because a lot of our legacy, the legacy documents which are ingesting, they might be scans. And also what we find is our clients also want to, for example, detect signatures or extract tables. So you know, at the core, we use llms that we fine tune. But there are also other sort of models in the stack. And yeah, in terms of business users, customers, it's the three main pockets are in procurement, compliance and KYC and legal. And
Yeah, sure. So on the technical front, yeah, we're taking foundational models, which we're fine tuning and self hosting.

S Speaker 48:01I guess, yeah, just for clarity, we don't use open AI, yeah, Asr and open source models that we function

S Speaker 18:10so do you have, do you specifically train the models for different industries and different use cases, like you mentioned, or is it one model which is serving all of these cases for now?
so do you have, do you specifically train the models for different industries and different use cases, like you mentioned, or is it one model which is serving all of these cases for now?

so do you have, do you specifically train the models for different industries and different use cases, like you mentioned, or is it one model which is serving all of these cases for now?
S Speaker 28:22So it's one model serving all these use cases. Yeah,
So it's one model serving all these use cases. Yeah,
So it's one model serving all these use cases. Yeah,
So it's one model serving all these use cases. Yeah,
S Speaker 18:25got it. And one question about this team, and would love to understand how you are thinking about it. Extracting information from unstructured data documents is one form of it. Is one of the core functionalities that a lot of leading llms are trying to target. So do you see down the line, the next version of chat GPT just does this on its own, and you don't need, really need fine tuned models for it.

S Speaker 110:15and I'd love to understand a little bit more about the workflow itself. Document extraction, Template Management is one part of it. Do you plan to expand into? Let's say, giving analytics becoming the next glean. How do you see some of your users use it? What's the workflow on their end look like?

S Speaker 311:08I'd say we would definitely have a look at incorporating more analytics onto the platform. But the reality is is most these users, they don't just want to view analytics. They want to be able to take this data and actually do something with it outside of the platform. And another sort of feature that's on the roadmap, which is probably have pretty soon, is as an example, if you sign a document and via DocuSign and it's sent into your email inbox, we want to be able to have an integration that automatically takes that document from your inbox and pushes it through Vault so no document gets lost.

S Speaker 312:07yeah, what we're definitely trying to do is a land and expand approach. So as an example, we have a US bank that we're speaking to, and we started the trial with, and for them, we're currently working with their KYC team, but they have multiple different teams within the organization that are paying attention and are actively assessing how it fits into their workflow.

S Speaker 212:36Well, we've been doubling prices every month because, you know, one thing is, you know, we're sort of really starting to see the value that we can't unlock. And also think, right now, we have taken the more of a user based pricing, but we're also seeing use cases where maybe it's sort of an analysis of 400,000 documents and that, in which case we sort of starting to introduce more of a document based pricing. But the great thing is, you know, these enterprises, they're huge, and they have millions of documents.

S Speaker 113:21Okay, one segment I would like to understand a little bit more is, at the outset, I have seen a lot of companies working on extracting information from unstructured data, and that data could be documents, that data at some places could be videos, and another places could be customer interactions in terms of conversations or chat bots documents. Seems to me like a place where there are a lot of players, and I wouldn't be able to say that tech is the main differentiation between a lot of these players today. So how are you thinking about the market. Do you see it crowded when you're talking to clients? Do you seek a lot of competition in the market? And what's your what's your perception around it?

S Speaker 214:10I mean, I think one of the key things is it is very easy to build an app with OpenAI, but, you know, and therefore, maybe that's why you sort of see lots of players, but when we're going sort of face to face and, you know, procurement processes, we're not in competition with other SaaS companies, because, you know, we're one of the very few players that actually has invested in open source and building our own models in house, which means that, you know, they trust us with their data, because we're dealing with sensitive documents, you know, contracts, invoices, statements of work. These are all documents which you don't want to send to open AI. And that sort of eliminates 99.9% of the competition. And then the second differentiator, obviously, is the public API. So we do actually, so the public API, for example, is powering the back office of a global law firm. And because a lot of these enterprise clients, but there is a bit of a fatigue with SaaS products, and they just want to be able to know that the task is being done by an AI somewhere. So that's sort of a key differentiator. And then, you know, although we are document agnostic, we obviously do have quite a strong position when it comes to understanding legal and financial concepts. And what we find is, you know, the trials sort of speak for themselves. We will, obviously, you know, sign an NDA will do them on their documents. And then if they want to play around the system, they will. And we find that, you know, it actually is doing a great job, because, as you know, AI, if it's, if it's garbage out there's no value. And just just this week, we've had two successful trials, fully users playing by themselves and then quite content with the performance.

S Speaker 115:52Interesting. Interesting. Are you guys raising around now?
Interesting. Interesting. Are you guys raising around now?
Interesting. Interesting. Are you guys raising around now?
Interesting. Interesting. Are you guys raising around now?
15:59Do you plan to be raising a rounding time soon.
S Speaker 316:04we're currently, we've just started our raise.
S Speaker 116:07Got it and what kind of round would be. How big are you thinking about it? What milestones runway Do you think that will cover?

S Speaker 216:15So yeah, 10 million is how much we're raising and obviously improving the product, but the key milestone is expanding to the US,

S Speaker 116:23interesting and 10 million. I'm curious about it. Why? Why 10? It seems like a big round, especially with a small traction right now. I'm assuming it's a seed round for you guys. How are you thinking about it? How long do you think this round would take you.

S Speaker 216:43I mean, a lot of the competitions that are working with open aI have raised 15 million, 200 million, so it's quite small in the context of the market. But I'd say, you know, although you know, traction is modest, or numerically, you know, next year, we're on target, even without the funding rounds, to get to 2 million in ARR so, you know, we're at an inflection point. And, you know, it's a huge market, and we can't keep up with demand right now.

S Speaker 117:15That's fair. That's fair. I totally understand there is a good willingness to pay for this market, and there is money to be making right away. So with this 10 million round, when do you think you would raise your next round? Probably by end of next year. Is that the plan is

S Speaker 217:34runway based on 10 million. Yeah, the idea is to have two years of runway with this round. And yeah, obviously, if we hit milestones, then we'll raise, you know, next year or early the year after
runway based on 10 million. Yeah, the idea is to have two years of runway with this round. And yeah, obviously, if we hit milestones, then we'll raise, you know, next year or early the year after

Would love to take a look at that, and I will go ahead connect you to my London team with Michelle, who works out of London, and I would introduce the team to the her, and would let her take it from you in the deck. If you can highlight, I'm sure it would be there, but traction and the tech pipeline is something we would like to look at. So that would be great if you can highlight that. Sounds

S Speaker 118:44in the US team, we are looking a lot at AI applications and foundation models as well. Personally, I am looking at the AI agent tech space, trying to take a more strategic look at it like we do not want to make up bets better here and there. So the plan is to really scan the market quite a lot. I've been talking to a lot of agent tech companies today, and at the same time, some foundational models which have very orthogonal approaches. So we are looking at a lot of physical AI foundational models, foundation models which can power cameras, mobile devices, AR and VR companies. Then a few foundational models which are very specialized. So one is in Earth simulation, things like that. So we're taking a look at all of that. And then I would say some of our recent investments was in one of the stealth foundation model companies working for physical AI. So this company can power all of your camera vision, and you can prompt things like, let me know when a dog which passes by this camera feed and box, and you can point to that specific draw and down the line, you can ask a drone to follow that dog. So that's an interesting company we looked at, made an investment in an retail automation company. So down the line, you can go into any store, the cameras would capture your face automatically, and you do not have to pay anywhere. You can walk out and your transaction would happen seamlessly. Seems like a very big market, early stage in terms of technology, but it's also a very exciting prospect, very

S Speaker 220:25interesting. We find there's definitely a lot of interest in agents when we speak to clients. But I guess what we found is to do agents Well, the underlying model is to be very accurate. Otherwise, you know, you can't really chain anything together. So that's that's why we've sort of delayed the implementation of the agents until we're sort of truly confident in the baseline accuracy,

S Speaker 120:47right? And I've seen a few companies tackle this by the way that they have understood, what are these edge cases where the agents actually fail? They have cohorted them, and they've made sure that for this specific edge cases their workflow, make sure that they have a human in loop, and they take these edge cases through that. So that's something you can explore. And especially with legal and financial it seems like the industry is way more mature in understanding AI, than the other industries today. So in that aspect, you can actually be a first mover. You
