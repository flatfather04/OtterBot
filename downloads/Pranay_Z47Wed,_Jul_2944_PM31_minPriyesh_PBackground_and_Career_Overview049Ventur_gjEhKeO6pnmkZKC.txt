S Speaker 11:21me. I would say, Yeah, understood. All right, that's why it's the first time we are chatting, and I want to make sure we are on time, just so that you can get to other interesting things. So I'll just start with a quick background after that, like I have seen your profiles on LinkedIn and saw some of the background, but we'll have to exchange your productions, and then maybe sort of dive a little deep into kind of how you're thinking about life, motivators and stuff like that. Yeah. So from my side, quickly, like I've been with for four years to work in enterprise software investing, and my focus is mostly on application layer, because that is my background. And before this, I was over at FreshWorks Gen X, over there for like, seven years, series eight to three, IPO, 5 million to three, 50 million revenues, and did a bunch of did a bunch of different things, but work with the CEO gracious, then let's optem do fundraisers and acquisitions there. Then move to the marketing side and build and let demand channel grow and see marketing teams, right? So all kind of go to market experience, but fortunate for that experience, because I learned how we built software in India, distributed globally, and was in the better opportunities in that scenario, prior to that phi.

The entire three years I've spent working with different so if I start from, I did my internet from IIT Madras was working with, I wasn't batting college discipline did not really follow my core discipline was working across several early stage startups during that time. So I would say undergrad worked with 10 plus early stage startups, interned with all of them, graduated and joined Team maths, which is a B to B renewable energy company in Bangalore. Worked there for about three and a half years. I joined in the business development team and then went on to start a few new business models for the company. Great experience. What years were you at IIT Madras? So I was 2013 to 2018 five year course. Yeah, I was in adore TV course,

So the plan is to get back to India. I want to get a lot of experience in venture started building, seeing some success story, I started to build, and then, essentially, either join a very reputed Indian venture fund or start something of my own. So that's longer plan. I think maybe next three to four years us may get some experience here, learn the playbooks and come back and apply them to

S Speaker 26:57buy? Interesting so one company from India that have recently met fiber AI. They are an Accel India back company fits my thesis of how marketing spaces are changing. So I broadly look at AI as across the different domains. But one of the domains that I particularly am very excited about is how AI is changing interactions with machines. And I see down the line, initially, interaction with machines were more code first, and then it changed to graphical user interface, then it changed to different form factors, from mobile to different variables, and now voice and AI skills particularly changing how interactions happen. So fiber AI fits that thesis where I see them dynamically changing different website based on a person's landing page. So a person clicks on an ad based on their demographic, based on their past experiences. And personalization, the landing page of the website is personalized. Every copy, every content, is dynamically generated, and that is allowing them to be very actively sort of tuned conversions, tune the right subject matter for some of these landing page guys. I also saw one more company called two frame, which was funded by COSLA here in the Bay. And these are the directly competing with them, a very big market. Seems like that would how a lot of websites would down the line change, and that would be one of the companies I would invest in. We evaluated their roundtable interface. So it did not work out for Qualcomm ventures. And that ventures at that point, but I'm sure they have closed around now, let me think of one more company that I can come across. Well, slightly, slightly personal for that matter, but my roommate from IIT Madras, he is working on a biotechnology company, so he has 12 packets around it, and his entire idea is, how do you work, or how do you take a person's DNA and personalize your entire workout regime, nutrition, disease prediction, lifestyle management around it? He is still in an R D project for now. He has built the platform. He's trying to find some design partners would probably like to

S Speaker 28:47founder. How do you think about Ankur? So Ankur, if I remember correctly, had his MBA from Stanford. We dug a little bit deeper into this background during Stanford. And turns out he explored quite a lot, which was something that I personally could relate with him. He had started a consumer brand company. Did you see which successfully exited? And that's a good signal, but particularly not really focusing my thesis around that. I would say, during his days at Stanford, Ankur did quite a lot of exploration around how venture markets are built, and he went to Brazil. He did a search fund around Brazil. So I would say I particularly rated him as a very ambitious founder. I would say he had big vision towards where he would build fiber from fiber too, and particularly today it's fiber is a landing page optimization company. But his vision, and with some of the background that he did, he was really trying to build something which would change how people interact with websites, or web based solutions, very broadly in the interface. So as a founder, I think his vision work. Well. He had strong technical background. He had work in the US. He I'm sure he would have had good networks. He also had race capital from accent, which would give him broad backing. And that was interesting. Few pros, I would say, in his background,

walk me through some of the deals
S Speaker 210:04that you've done. So Brad did three deal deals in the last year or so, wrote term sheets in two months where we did not get allocation. So the most latest deal that I did was a company called fondax Ai. This was a deal that I had sourced. We have known the founder for a year, and now they raised a PC round, which was smaller for us. Then we did their seed round, $10 million round, co invested with Lux capital and general capitalist. Now these are behind context, $2 million so $2 million we are usually a follow on check. We don't lead rounds. And thesis behind context AI is that they are particularly AI native office suite, so they think of it as a 60 with AI native integrations. Now there are a lot of vertical point solutions targeting this market, knowledge workers. There are different applications for presentation generation, different applications for data analysis, different for web research, but a lot of these workflows are very tightly ingrained in each other. So for me, I see myself researching on the web, taking some of those insights, putting it on a doc, taking some insights of that, putting it on Excel, creating a few chart, putting it back on a dock, and putting it back on a doc and essentially creating a PPD at the end, these workflows are tied together. So context is one platform which ties all of these workflows together. They've also done a lot of work on long context understanding and long term memory. So when we tried the app, it actually really worked well in terms of the extensive amount of data. It could research, a lot of deep research does that both Google and OpenAI now, but they for one particular context. They used to do it very well with all of your internal knowledge sources as well. So all of your internal data sources, it would understand a person's identification within the entire enterprise context. So it's pre issues of senior associated call commenters, and is probably approaching this thesis in a particular way. And hence, let's fine tune the presentations in a particular way, versus Bucha imagined Qualcomm ventures would create something in a different way. So it would understand that as well, and you would be able and you would be able to do the entire workflow on that. They were pre product. So they were they would go GA next month, and we tried the beta app. They have design partners as McKinsey and zs associates and a few other consultancy also. They're selling into consultancy strategy, Biz Ops, role product teams, venture capitalists, private equity people. And really felt that this, this is a the team itself, I would say, going back to the founder, Joseph is a drop up. He's a thief fellow, and he, since probably the age of 12, has been tinkering with a lot of solutions. He built, he has built three or four AI native companies which scale very fast in the consumer market. So also felt his product velocity and ability to gain virality was very high, which I feel would be very critical in a very crowded space like this, to
that you've done. So Brad did three deal deals in the last year or so, wrote term sheets in two months where we did not get allocation.

It could research, a lot of deep research does that both Google and OpenAI now, but they for one particular context. They used to do it very well with all of your internal knowledge sources as well. So all of your internal data sources, it would understand a person's identification within the entire enterprise context. So it's pre issues of senior associated call commenters, and is probably approaching this thesis in a particular way. And hence, let's fine tune the presentations in a particular way, versus Bucha imagined Qualcomm ventures would create something in a different way. So it would understand that as well, and you would be able and you would be able to do the entire workflow on that. They were pre product. So they were they would go GA next month, and we tried the beta app. They have design partners as McKinsey and zs associates and a few other consultancy also. They're selling into consultancy strategy, Biz Ops, role product teams, venture capitalists, private equity people. And really felt that this, this is a the team itself, I would say, going back to the founder, Joseph is a drop up. He's a thief fellow, and he, since probably the age of 12, has been tinkering with a lot of solutions. He built, he has built three or four AI native companies which scale very fast in the consumer market. So also felt his product velocity and ability to gain virality was very high, which I feel would be very critical in a very crowded space like this, to
that you've done. So Brad did three deal deals in the last year or so, wrote term sheets in two months where we did not get allocation. So the most latest deal that I did was a company called fondax Ai. This was a deal that I had sourced. We have known the founder for a year, and now they raised a PC round, which was smaller for us. Then we did their seed round, $10 million round, co invested with Lux capital and general capitalist. Now these are behind context, $2 million so $2 million we are usually a follow on check. We don't lead rounds. And thesis behind context AI is that they are particularly AI native office suite, so they think of it as a 60 with AI native integrations. Now there are a lot of vertical point solutions targeting this market, knowledge workers. There are different applications for presentation generation, different applications for data analysis, different for web research, but a lot of these workflows are very tightly ingrained in each other. So for me, I see myself researching on the web, taking some of those insights, putting it on a doc, taking some insights of that, putting it on Excel, creating a few chart, putting it back on a dock, and putting it back on a doc and essentially creating a PPD at the end, these workflows are tied together.

S Speaker 216:43early and they haven't decided a category yet. Most of the users are coming from audio books, marketing education, use cases. So I wouldn't say they have defined a vertical yet they would want to go enterprise as per say, that they would have an enterprise offering, they would create a platform, they would have an API based solution, and they want to build up, but that's not where they want to spend most of their massive muscle in we, with Qualcomm, discussed a few applications. We may be able to set up an enterprise side of things with for them, but their particular focus is being the consumer layer. So where these guys want to expand on it is not just being like you mentioned. It's a very competitive space infrastructure. A lot of companies are providing voice infrastructure. They want to expand into voice companions and beyond. Voice companions does not act as something like a character AI or Chai, but go beyond that and create an agentic infrastructure behind it. So they want to be the OS, where people want to talk to AI for more emotional use cases, they would go to Open audios product. You want to sort of expand from that companion to also take actions on your behalf, mostly on mobile devices. You would go on open audios application. And then lastly, they want it as a two way feed. So it's not like a chatbot where you go and speak to a companion. It's also a two way feed in the sense that they would understand your preferences, they would personalize the companion based on you, and the companion could start conversation down the line so they again, similarly, they're working on long term memory, which I feel would be key to sort of unlocking this area. But coming back to your initial question, I spoke quite a lot about different aspects. They haven't decided on a vertical as per se. They haven't created a very marketing first motion, yet most of their users are coming organically from their open source communities. So on where they see less competition, and based on where they see market pool, they will probably expand the prosumer navigation there, but they're just using this, the entire voice API, part of things, to build on the consumer app. Similar question

They don't have didn't they had one model that, but it wasn't very differentiated in the market, and there were a lot of players. So was it interesting enough? But I stayed connected to the people. Then I saw CJ hfos residency. HFO is one of the areas accelerator actually quite wide, well known, and they they back with the founders. So during that time, went to HF. Was Demo Day, saw him again presenting. Saw that he got very crazy traction in a few months during HFO residency. And that was interesting point. We started those discussions he wasn't raising at that point. So we, while we preempted, wanted to launch this new dialog based model that he has launched now, and wanted to raise post that after creating a big wave. But at that point, we preempted around. We got him connected to a lot of business units at Qualcomm, particularly because some of his models are very small. One of the smallest models he has is a 400 million parameters model, which could work both on running influence on the mobile itself, and then maybe down the line, he could even quantify run on wherever. So that was interesting business unit propositions that Qualcomm was also interested in. So we got some of those connections going, and then we emptied around. He was excited to get Qualcomm on board, because he felt we could kick start his enterprise offering, and then the podium can then focus on consumer application, and maybe the enterprise app becomes a cash cow. They also did a lot of work on their inference stacks. So one of the engineers was from Tiktok inference team, and their gross margins on this platform was 99% they could undercut 11 laps by 2x 3x and still provide similar levels of accuracy, although we had to test all of these out, but they could have done that. So that was also an interesting proposition. Interesting proposition. And eventually we did not write this check, because it got flagged in Qualcomm's compliance checks. And AI companion is something that Qualcomm is a little bit worried about. So it could go in different directions. It could be an AI, girlfriend, boyfriend, it could expand into that. And the founder's motivations were also coming from that place. So it got flagged there, and we could not write a check. Eventually they are raising around now. So we preempted it. We, we wanted to write a few words. We got they he raised from an angel at 100 million Valley. We, he was ready to raise with us at 60 so, so that was a great proposition. We and, but we did not write that. So he launched his model, I could say, a couple of weeks back, and he's currently

S Speaker 129:10if you're a COVID deals, right, you need one of three or four things, either you are first and fastest, right, which means either you're only putting it, or you're contrarian that you're looking at things, or you're running a fast process straight to the answer first, yes. So you are fast, or you pay the highest price, right? Or you have some kind of brand or reputation or pool, right now you have to win on behalf. Right now, what works in India is usually brand and reputation. What works in the US, or what we anticipate most in the US, is we have to be first and fast, right? And usually, see, even in India, we follow the same philosophy that we want to do deals preemptively, like all the deals that I've done at this like idea stage right, we see are founders who have not finalized what to build, but with them, I think my medium sort of founder relationship. Before a seed investment relations. We've actually churned through ideas with them, done like 25 conversations together. And when the time comes to actually formalize it, we are like first founder, right? Same way, if it is series A you're basically trying to break through and get to those founders before they're in market. Because in very market, it's a market deal at market price. You know, many competitive bid show up. We usually don't play that, right? So ideally, we first asked, contrary to the best of our abilities, but obviously there will be evolution from what we do in India, right? I think the other question you asked also relevant. But I guess in the US, it sort of become like this, almost a powerful approach, where there's a large platforms, mainly GC, like speed addressing, who can get a $20 billion fund to intercede, to exercise, optionally, uh, that's the game. So series, a series is the hardest stage to offer. And then there's the two pre seed funds who are 101, 5200, I think those deals are a lot more collaborative. These people have been degraded distribution. Get a lot of access early on. So I think we probably email earlier rather than later, right? Because if you have $500 million CDs fund, it's actually right. You keep like, see access and Bs, it's these, usually the larger platforms who are, like, extremely competitive with, like, valuation that price, right? So we'll probably go earlier, right? And we've seen it usually, I see like, two, 3 million party rounds. People are collab. Rounds. People are collaborative, putting opportunities. It's probably a good place for us. Yeah,

And when the time comes to actually formalize it, we are like first founder, right? Same way, if it is series A you're basically trying to break through and get to those founders before they're in market. Because in very market, it's a market deal at market price. You know, many competitive bid show up. We usually don't play that, right? So ideally, we first asked, contrary to the best of our abilities, but obviously there will be evolution from what we do in India, right? I think the other question you asked also relevant. But I guess in the US, it sort of become like this, almost a powerful approach, where there's a large platforms, mainly GC, like speed addressing, who can get a $20 billion fund to intercede, to exercise, optionally, uh, that's the game. So series, a series is the hardest stage to offer. And then there's the two pre seed funds who are 101, 5200, I think those deals are a lot more collaborative. These people have been degraded distribution. Get a lot of access early on. So I think we probably email earlier rather than later, right? Because if you have $500 million CDs fund, it's actually right. You keep like, see access and Bs, it's these, usually the larger platforms who are, like, extremely competitive with, like, valuation that price, right? So we'll probably go earlier, right? And we've seen it usually, I see like, two, 3 million party rounds. People are collab. Rounds. People are collaborative, putting opportunities. It's probably a good place for us. Yeah,
if you're a COVID deals, right, you need one of three or four things, either you are first and fastest, right, which means either you're only putting it, or you're contrarian that you're looking at things, or you're running a fast process straight to the answer first, yes. So you are fast, or you pay the highest price, right? Or you have some kind of brand or reputation or pool, right now you have to win on behalf. Right now, what works in India is usually brand and reputation. What works in the US, or what we anticipate most in the US, is we have to be first and fast, right?
