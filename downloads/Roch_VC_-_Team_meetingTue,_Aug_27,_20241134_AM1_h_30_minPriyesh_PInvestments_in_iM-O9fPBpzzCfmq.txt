0:00One two investments, one in China, one in the US.
S Speaker 15:40So that's, that's, that's a product, existing use case, new, the new use cases being unlocked. And, you know, it's a series B Company. Next year they'll raise, they'll start to raise a Series C round. They took an investment in a strategic partnership with lendings and gear earlier this year. It's public information, lenders and gear invested $50 million and they want to lend us a gear as a leader in smart meters, basically looking at their future and says, okay, there isn't a whole lot to grow from here. So they are looking to white label the spend panel so they can get a bitter bigger footprint in the homes. And so with the investment came some partner channel, partner technology opportunities and some product co development opportunities.

S Speaker 17:48Yeah, I think Carlos that would love the intro, just especially in advance of any kind of fundraise, get spelled, see, see how there's areas where we could work together. I mean, that's a empowering founders. That's core to kind of what we do is just got to know what's your name is fighting this company says he founder, CEO, still the head, yeah, yeah, yeah. Single founder, like I said, super impressive guy I was. I was really awestruck by his vision and his ability to execute as I sit through board meetings, is like his, you know, how he's thinking about developing new variants of the product that unlock new revenue streams and new revenue opportunities. It's pretty impressive. And he's assembled, you know, pretty solid team. So that's awesome. Well, yeah, would definitely welcome the intro. We appreciate that sounds like a really interesting company, and love the founder aspect of it as well. That's pretty rare. We've come across a lot of your two fields, yeah, yeah, great.

S Speaker 111:41would be better to invest in software only companies, right? Because you don't have the issues of product, supply chain, gross margins and all that. But, you know, and there's a lot of companies out there doing this, priyesh and I are trying to unpack. You look at the websites, they all kind of like, look the same. We do this, we do that, so trying to unpack, really, what they do, etc. So have started talking to startups to try to get a better understanding. And so I'll turn it over to you guys. I'd love to hear from you. What are your thoughts on this space? What are you focusing on? What's your thesis? Are there any companies we should? We should? You know, adopt? Yeah, I would love to do that. And just made you guys think about the amount of deals you screen, and so you've made two investments. I mean, how many deals are you looking at? And what's your goal? Do you have any goals in terms of wait? Typically, adults set goals for ourselves. Maybe one area has been AI. If you heard of AI, everybody's excited about it.

33:47we can move the supply chain, if that makes sense.
S Speaker 133:48Yeah, let's switch over, and I'm gonna slowly move to my mobile here, so be off camera. That's good supply chain front. So Keaton spent a lot of time in this over the last several years. I'm kind of ramping up over the last few months, but they really what motivate says. I mean, you think about the amount of freight that we move and the amount of manufacturing sites that we have, we just have a lot of good capabilities and touch points here. And so we're big believers of the autonomous movement of goods. I think that that'll continue to accelerate. I think one of the lessons learned there is just the hardware component can be a bit challenging in terms of developing that to a commercial business model that actually makes money. And so we actually stayed out of a lot of investments over the last few years, just given that dynamic. And Keaton got a great rule of thumb. And for traded companies, if you're 95% there, he's really curious on any five, because that sounds great, but you still have a long ways to go potentially. And so that's kind of how we think about the space. And Keith can highlight any investments that I think we have a couple interesting ones that we're highlighting, and then we can go from there. Yeah, great. So I think, as John noted, the last couple years, we've continued to be active in the market in this space, but haven't done quite as many deals. We've continued to, I'll say, generally, Scout technology for our Coke operating companies, and continue to be interested in seeing and hearing about anything that could be interesting to our operating companies. But it's just been tougher to get deals done, partially due to the dynamics that John noted around some of these for AI, vision based robotics solutions, we've seen a lot of them struggle to actually put out a product that's producing a real customer. Roi, but then additionally, as I'm sure you guys have observed, if you're spending any time in the space at all, is just following covid right with the supply chain issues, and then a hot time in the financial markets. On top of that, there was just what felt like endless money pouring into the space. And so valuations went nuts, and it feels like we're kind of hitting a point here where we're seeing some of those company resets, revaluations, and so growing more optimistic, the more good investment opportunities will be there. But, but they still seem there's still a little a little challenging to find right now, and you're, in some ways, you're kind of having to pick up the pieces a little bit. For some of these companies that are having to reset a little bit, but a couple of the maybe more noteworthy investments we've made, and I'll dance around a few. So please interrupt if anything's particularly interesting or there's questions, but a couple of autonomous robotics companies. So Outrider is one with you on that one. Okay, excellent, excellent. I'm sorry I forgot.

S Speaker 136:54third wave. We looked at Outrider by fall. Couldn't come across the valuation numbers, so we passed on that really like Android team. But so we ended up putting a bet, placing a bet on third wave, which is forklifts, autonomous forklifts and warehouses. We thought the sort of the environment of warehouses, you know, without inclement weather and things like that were easier problem to solve, if you will. And but we know the team,

S Speaker 137:39No Carlos very much agree on the warehouse perspective. And so we've actually, we're familiar with third wave. We've actually got an investment in a company that's, I don't know that they're directly competitive today, but I think they may be in the future, company called Gideon brothers out of Croatia. So they're specifically focused on trailer, load, unload today, but from a from a high level, they are autonomous forklifts. And so I understand third waves, not is a little more broad, maybe in their focus today, but, but I think your your thesis on the inside of the four walls of the warehouse. We very much agree with and we've spent more focus there, yeah. Unfortunately for Andrew, when we visited the company in Denver, it started snowing, and then all of a sudden, very quickly, the lighters weren't working, etc. There's not quite ready for prime time. Yeah,
No Carlos very much agree on the warehouse perspective. And so we've actually, we're familiar with third wave.

Yeah,
S Speaker 138:37Yeah, they usually snow inside of the warehouse. But, yeah, outriders still got in, frankly, on that weather issue. It goes beyond Outrider, right? I think just some of the sensor limitations that exist today, there's going to need to be some advancements. But we, we see a bunch of potential there, and we're really interested in that. Gatic is another one that's doing more. Describe it as middle mile, but it's it's over the road, repeatable, fixed routes, and so it would be like a right now, they're running routes for like Walmart, from a dark store to the storefront where they're just running that circle all day long. And so it's again, fixed, repeatable routes, so they can, well map it, reduce the number of variables in that regard. So that's another one in the space that's interesting. We're also in trachonomy, which I think in some ways, is probably competitive to I think I saw you guys are in time and roam be maybe. So it's so it's broader than just tracking devices in it's really the miniaturization of just about any sensor. And so we've actually got some more experimenting with some different coke use cases around even like vibration sensors for predictive maintenance and things like that. And so I think across Coke, there's a lot of really interesting ways we're experimenting. And so I think we're we're getting a lot of value from the company and hopefully creating value for the company at the same time. REPA repower is one in the freight space. It's effectively an Airbnb for freight trailers. So it's basically the large enterprise fleets, the large trucking companies, carriers that have an excess of trailers that are highly underutilized, are kind of the supply side, and it gives them an opportunity to list that underutilized capacity on the marketplace. And then a lot of the smaller Mom and Pop owner operators, Joe's trucking company that has maybe a truck, but no trailers, is more the demand side, so they have an opportunity to access those trailers, ultimately making the whole system more efficient. That's a pretty early stage one today. That's that's had some really interesting organic growth, that has a really interesting business model in a space that hasn't gotten a lot of attention historically. Maybe one, one other worth noting, and then I'll pause for a minute, is percepto, autonomous drone inspection of our industrial sites. So we've got a handful of our Coke operating sites today. It's basically displacing some of the I'll call it human walking around the site on a daily basis just to do visual inspections. We're doing it with a drum, fixed, repeatable, autonomous flights that can be done a couple times a day. And so, again, a fairly odd focus, interested in anything that could be interesting to any of our Coke operating companies, which which results in us being pretty broad and pretty opportunistic in the space.
Yeah, they usually snow inside of the warehouse. But, yeah, outriders still got in, frankly, on that weather issue. It goes beyond Outrider, right? I think just some of the sensor limitations that exist today, there's going to need to be some advancements. But we, we see a bunch of potential there, and we're really interested in that. Gatic is another one that's doing more.

And so it's again, fixed, repeatable routes, so they can, well map it, reduce the number of variables in that regard. So that's another one in the space that's interesting. We're also in trachonomy, which I think in some ways, is probably competitive to I think I saw you guys are in time and roam be maybe. So it's so it's broader than just tracking devices in it's really the miniaturization of just about any sensor. And so we've actually got some more experimenting with some different coke use cases around even like vibration sensors for predictive maintenance and things like that. And so I think across Coke, there's a lot of really interesting ways we're experimenting. And so I think we're we're getting a lot of value from the company and hopefully creating value for the company at the same time. REPA repower is one in the freight space. It's effectively an Airbnb for freight trailers. So it's basically the large enterprise fleets, the large trucking companies, carriers that have an excess of trailers that are highly underutilized, are kind of the supply side, and it gives them an opportunity to list that underutilized capacity on the marketplace. And then a lot of the smaller Mom and Pop owner operators, Joe's trucking company that has maybe a truck, but no trailers, is more the demand side, so they have an opportunity to access those trailers, ultimately making the whole system more efficient. That's a pretty early stage one today. That's that's had some really interesting organic growth, that has a really interesting business model in a space that hasn't gotten a lot of attention historically. Maybe one, one other worth noting, and then I'll pause for a minute, is percepto, autonomous drone inspection of our industrial sites. So we've got a handful of our Coke operating sites today. It's basically displacing some of the I'll call it human walking around the site on a daily basis just to do visual inspections. We're doing it with a drum, fixed, repeatable, autonomous flights that can be done a couple times a day. And so, again, a fairly odd focus, interested in anything that could be interesting to any of our Coke operating companies, which which results in us being pretty broad and pretty opportunistic in the space.
Yeah, they usually snow inside of the warehouse. But, yeah, outriders still got in, frankly, on that weather issue. It goes beyond Outrider, right? I think just some of the sensor limitations that exist today, there's going to need to be some advancements. But we, we see a bunch of potential there, and we're really interested in that.

S Speaker 151:20But Rich. I think overall, just given a few of your comments, I think there could be some really interesting overlap here. Even your comment around, like, more of the logistics, kind of closer to the delivery. I think one of the observations we've had over time is that some of the I guess I'll just say, like, maybe venture back to like, more successful companies in the supply chain space have been those that are a little more services oriented, and so they've taken more time to grow. But it really feels like those that have been kind of outsized winners have been more kind of in that vein. So yeah, no, absolutely. I mean, we took a lot of heat over the initial couple of years on aerospace as a tech enabled service provider and not a true SAS player. And you know, we're happy we took that bet. Yeah.

S Speaker 154:13you know, there's a lot of cross thematic interest, right? And the door is open for collaboration, back and towards us, right? I mean, we would love to have you guys resources to get your guys's perspective on things, because, I mean, it's not every day that we run across partners that are interested in energy and supply chain and the number of things that we're mutually interested in. So you guys touch markets that we just simply don't or we touch in different ways. So we appreciate your collaboration up to this point and look forward to continuing conversations from here. Yeah, same, absolutely
