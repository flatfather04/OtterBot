============================================================

S Speaker 10:00Be a clearing house on the back end in some of the cases. Yeah. Does that make sense? And yeah, we should, you should also have a chat with Ketel. Ketel has a very deep understanding, yeah,

yes, makes sense. Got
S Speaker 30:31it. And one more change that I've made. Version here is they mentioned that they've got these estimates from JP Morgan that the average transaction size would increase from 15 to 35 over years. I've just given it a haircut and made it from 15 to 25 okay, and that
it. And one more change that I've made. Version here is they mentioned that they've got these estimates from JP Morgan that the average transaction size would increase from 15 to 35 over years. I've just given it a haircut and made it from 15 to 25 okay, and that

S Speaker 11:00we can take over, right? And once this is done, that would be good,

S Speaker 31:04yeah, that'd make a much better readable version of a Tencent.
yeah, that'd make a much better readable version of a Tencent.
yeah, that'd make a much better readable version of a Tencent.
yeah, that'd make a much better readable version of a Tencent.
S Speaker 31:15one more point was, again given by JPMC. And I think if we have jpmcs commercial contract, we can validate some of these, but they say that ACH adoption would increase significantly over years. Let me see what management had it before. I saw last year, it increased 7.5% they were increasing it very aggressively. So from 10 to 30, I saw it increased by 7.5% last year, so I've just increased it by 15% year on year, and then probably about 20, 25% in later years. That's probably
one more point was, again given by JPMC. And I think if we have jpmcs commercial contract, we can validate some of these, but they say that ACH adoption would increase significantly over years.

S Speaker 21:55like the part that I'm personally like, the most pessimistic. Or I don't, I don't, I don't see how they get to 20% I unless the credit cards, they also, they all avoid their, yeah, exactly otherwise, like, what
like the part that I'm personally like, the most pessimistic. Or I don't, I don't, I don't see how they get to 20% I unless the credit cards, they also, they all avoid their, yeah, exactly otherwise, like, what

S Speaker 12:12this can also be debit, debit. So one is, debit goes directly, right? Debit doesn't go on the rails of MasterCard, Visa, and then if it is PayPal or sell or others, but yeah, you have to believe that you will move out of a card to Ach,
this can also be debit, debit. So one is, debit goes directly, right? Debit doesn't go on the rails of MasterCard, Visa, and then if it is PayPal or sell or others, but yeah, you have to believe that you will move out of a card to Ach,

2:31yeah, which, yes,
2:36I didn't buy that on the pitch. That's the
I didn't buy that on the pitch. That's the
I didn't buy that on the pitch. That's the
I didn't buy that on the pitch. That's the
2:37only thing. Fair point.

S Speaker 32:41Okay, okay, so on the model perspective, made those changes for
Okay, okay, so on the model perspective, made those changes for
Okay, okay, so on the model perspective, made those changes for
Okay, okay, so on the model perspective, made those changes for
S Speaker 12:47and then go back to the summary for a second. So, so the way we have done the revenue projections is we have just like, slash them by, is there a logic to the slashing? So
and then go back to the summary for a second. So, so the way we have done the revenue projections is we have just like, slash them by, is there a logic to the slashing? So
and then go back to the summary for a second. So, so the way we have done the revenue projections is we have just like, slash them by, is there a logic to the slashing? So
and then go back to the summary for a second. So, so the way we have done the revenue projections is we have just like, slash them by, is there a logic to the slashing? So
S Speaker 33:01the only top line slashing that I've done Bucha, is on the licensing revenue, which I've sort of discounted by 85% it seemed too high, 360, 5 million in five years. But other than that, JPMC, non JPMC. Again, like I mentioned, the slashing has been on one how many non JPMC merchants do they acquire? Will the biometric the percentage
the only top line slashing that I've done Bucha, is on the licensing revenue, which I've sort of discounted by 85% it seemed too high, 360, 5 million in five years.

S Speaker 13:27the same right that they get the point, whatever the Yes, yes, yeah, we just reduce the number of yes, okay,
the same right that they get the point, whatever the Yes, yes, yeah, we just reduce the number of yes, okay,
the same right that they get the point, whatever the Yes, yes, yeah, we just reduce the number of yes, okay,
the same right that they get the point, whatever the Yes, yes, yeah, we just reduce the number of yes, okay,
S Speaker 33:37total biometric transaction size and ACH adoption. Okay, so one question I had here was, are we sure that the numbers that JPMC is projecting, they will be able to hit because they mentioned that it's not contractually obligated for JPMC to bring that those many merchants, but they have some sort of downside protection there. Yeah,
total biometric transaction size and ACH adoption. Okay, so one question I had here was, are we sure that the numbers that JPMC is projecting, they will be able to hit because they mentioned that it's not contractually obligated for JPMC to bring that those many merchants, but they have some sort of downside protection there.

Yeah,
4:01no, no, right? It's hard to say, to say, understood.
no, no, right? It's hard to say, to say, understood.
no, no, right? It's hard to say, to say, understood.
no, no, right? It's hard to say, to say, understood.
S Speaker 34:23number of transactions, or transaction payment volume. You had
number of transactions, or transaction payment volume. You had
number of transactions, or transaction payment volume. You had
number of transactions, or transaction payment volume. You had
S Speaker 14:26that the the assumptions, which was 4% or 20% of the 4% yes, yes. So we should add something on top, saying, What does this imply? How much they capture? Okay,
that the the assumptions, which was 4% or 20% of the 4% yes, yes. So we should add something on top, saying, What does this imply? How much they capture? Okay,
that the the assumptions, which was 4% or 20% of the 4% yes, yes. So we should add something on top, saying, What does this imply? How much they capture? Okay,
that the the assumptions, which was 4% or 20% of the 4% yes, yes. So we should add something on top, saying, What does this imply? How much they capture? Okay,
4:41I will add that. Let's
I will add that. Let's
I will add that. Let's
I will add that. Let's
4:42just add that on top
S Speaker 14:50and the and we can just do a simple math that for this to happen, the it's roughly 80 million revenue in the end. Yeah. And if we just use the lower number of assumption, which was point one two, they just use point oh, five as I think that's that's another thing we can just add on top, which will be the total payment volume. Okay,
and the and we can just do a simple math that for this to happen, the it's roughly 80 million revenue in the end. Yeah. And if we just use the lower number of assumption, which was point one two, they just use point oh, five as I think that's that's another thing we can just add on top, which will be the total payment volume.

Okay,
5:19cross JVP. Okay. GBP
S Speaker 35:23got it. I haven't made any big changes on the cogs. Yeah, most of the cogs were fixed. Cogs on the technology side, and then some revenue sharing, so I haven't changed that. And gross profit OPEX kept it constant.
got it. I haven't made any big changes on the cogs. Yeah, most of the cogs were fixed. Cogs on the technology side, and then some revenue sharing, so I haven't changed that. And gross profit OPEX kept it constant.

got it. I haven't made any big changes on the cogs. Yeah, most of the cogs were fixed. Cogs on the technology side, and then some revenue sharing, so I haven't changed that. And gross profit OPEX kept it constant.
S Speaker 15:44OPEX is 5.3 going to 11 over. Okay, all right, 11 million to get to look at that. David, what a scalable business. 11 million OPEX to get to like 400 million in revenue. Okay? So we get the OPEX the same the cost. What is, can you add a gross margin? Yes, yeah, just add the template we have for IC Yeah. I'll
OPEX is 5.3 going to 11 over. Okay, all right, 11 million to get to look at that. David, what a scalable business. 11 million OPEX to get to like 400 million in revenue. Okay? So we get the OPEX the same the cost. What is, can you add a gross margin? Yes, yeah, just add the template we have for IC Yeah. I'll

OPEX is 5.3 going to 11 over. Okay, all right, 11 million to get to look at that. David, what a scalable business. 11 million OPEX to get to like 400 million in revenue. Okay? So we get the OPEX the same the cost. What is, can you add a gross margin? Yes, yeah, just add the template we have for IC Yeah. I'll
6:13put it in the IC template, yeah.
put it in the IC template, yeah.
put it in the IC template, yeah.
put it in the IC template, yeah.
S Speaker 16:19And so we are assuming it doesn't require any more funding beyond the 15 million. Yeah,
And so we are assuming it doesn't require any more funding beyond the 15 million. Yeah,
And so we are assuming it doesn't require any more funding beyond the 15 million. Yeah,
And so we are assuming it doesn't require any more funding beyond the 15 million. Yeah,
6:24it seems like that, but in 2020 follow on funding next year, right? Yeah,
it seems like that, but in 2020 follow on funding next year, right? Yeah,
it seems like that, but in 2020 follow on funding next year, right? Yeah,
it seems like that, but in 2020 follow on funding next year, right? Yeah,
S Speaker 16:34yeah, let's add another funding of 30 million. Okay, because you have 4 million ending cash balance. 3 million cash balance is very low, yeah. So we can even add a 50 million financing, okay?
yeah, let's add another funding of 30 million. Okay, because you have 4 million ending cash balance. 3 million cash balance is very low, yeah. So we can even add a 50 million financing, okay?
yeah, let's add another funding of 30 million. Okay, because you have 4 million ending cash balance. 3 million cash balance is very low, yeah. So we can even add a 50 million financing, okay?
yeah, let's add another funding of 30 million. Okay, because you have 4 million ending cash balance. 3 million cash balance is very low, yeah. So we can even add a 50 million financing, okay?
S Speaker 26:49And Quinn, Quinn is gonna say, like, there's gonna be another financing for sure. Yeah, yeah.
And Quinn, Quinn is gonna say, like, there's gonna be another financing for sure. Yeah, yeah.
And Quinn, Quinn is gonna say, like, there's gonna be another financing for sure. Yeah, yeah.
And Quinn, Quinn is gonna say, like, there's gonna be another financing for sure. Yeah, yeah.
S Speaker 16:54So that's why just, like, just preempt all those questions and just get everything done in the first shot.
So that's why just, like, just preempt all those questions and just get everything done in the first shot.
So that's why just, like, just preempt all those questions and just get everything done in the first shot.
So that's why just, like, just preempt all those questions and just get everything done in the first shot.
S Speaker 37:01Okay? 50 million in 2026, and I will so Varsha for that round in our return analysis, do we assume pro rata? Yeah, okay.
Okay? 50 million in 2026, and I will so Varsha for that round in our return analysis, do we assume pro rata? Yeah, okay.
Okay? 50 million in 2026, and I will so Varsha for that round in our return analysis, do we assume pro rata? Yeah, okay.
Okay? 50 million in 2026, and I will so Varsha for that round in our return analysis, do we assume pro rata? Yeah, okay.
S Speaker 17:14Assume 2 million investment here, yeah. Assume that the valuation is 38 million, because I know is sliding. Okay, right? So 2 million investment, and then 38 million
Assume 2 million investment here, yeah. Assume that the valuation is 38 million, because I know is sliding. Okay, right? So 2 million investment, and then 38 million
Assume 2 million investment here, yeah. Assume that the valuation is 38 million, because I know is sliding. Okay, right? So 2 million investment, and then 38 million
Assume 2 million investment here, yeah. Assume that the valuation is 38 million, because I know is sliding. Okay, right? So 2 million investment, and then 38 million
S Speaker 37:29got it. And then last question on my end, Bucha was on return analysis. How do I model the warrants? Because I know it's dependent on some business milestones to be achieved.
got it. And then last question on my end, Bucha was on return analysis. How do I model the warrants? Because I know it's dependent on some business milestones to be achieved.
got it. And then last question on my end, Bucha was on return analysis. How do I model the warrants? Because I know it's dependent on some business milestones to be achieved.
got it. And then last question on my end, Bucha was on return analysis. How do I model the warrants? Because I know it's dependent on some business milestones to be achieved.
S Speaker 17:41Yeah, so just assume, like, just model without and model with.
Yeah, so just assume, like, just model without and model with.
Yeah, so just assume, like, just model without and model with.
Yeah, so just assume, like, just model without and model with.
S Speaker 37:46So I so the way I understood the warrant so far is that 50% of it gets vested once we have a commercial agreement and once we sell some chips, and then another 50 should
So I so the way I understood the warrant so far is that 50% of it gets vested once we have a commercial agreement and once we sell some chips, and then another 50 should
So I so the way I understood the warrant so far is that 50% of it gets vested once we have a commercial agreement and once we sell some chips, and then another 50 should
So I so the way I understood the warrant so far is that 50% of it gets vested once we have a commercial agreement and once we sell some chips, and then another 50 should
8:03happen this year,
S Speaker 38:06according to them, got it, and another 50 is with UPI partnership and some another agreement. So, so
according to them, got it, and another 50 is with UPI partnership and some another agreement. So, so
according to them, got it, and another 50 is with UPI partnership and some another agreement. So, so
according to them, got it, and another 50 is with UPI partnership and some another agreement. So, so
S Speaker 18:12our exit is, like, four years out, right? Five years out, yeah, so just assume that the warrants happen. Okay?
our exit is, like, four years out, right? Five years out, yeah, so just assume that the warrants happen. Okay?
our exit is, like, four years out, right? Five years out, yeah, so just assume that the warrants happen. Okay?
our exit is, like, four years out, right? Five years out, yeah, so just assume that the warrants happen. Okay?
8:23So, yeah, so we have an additional investment there, right? Yes,
So, yeah, so we have an additional investment there, right? Yes,
So, yeah, so we have an additional investment there, right? Yes,
So, yeah, so we have an additional investment there, right? Yes,
8:31those warrants Priyesh or Penny warrants or,
those warrants Priyesh or Penny warrants or,
those warrants Priyesh or Penny warrants or,
those warrants Priyesh or Penny warrants or,
8:34yeah, yes, they are.
S Speaker 18:52Okay, okay, so let's just assume for return calculation, it's 100% vested. Yeah,
Okay, okay, so let's just assume for return calculation, it's 100% vested. Yeah,
Okay, okay, so let's just assume for return calculation, it's 100% vested. Yeah,
Okay, okay, so let's just assume for return calculation, it's 100% vested. Yeah,
S Speaker 39:00understood. Okay, for sure. And I'm using a 6x multiple revenue, multiple based on these comps, I think that looks that could be okay.
understood. Okay, for sure. And I'm using a 6x multiple revenue, multiple based on these comps, I think that looks that could be okay.
understood. Okay, for sure. And I'm using a 6x multiple revenue, multiple based on these comps, I think that looks that could be okay.
understood. Okay, for sure. And I'm using a 6x multiple revenue, multiple based on these comps, I think that looks that could be okay.
S Speaker 19:17So, so that is five serve, David, use, so don't use Ping and Okta, because those are actually hang on one second. So we got, actually got a broad set of companies in there. Yeah, you got clear, right? That's the clear. Yes, okay, that's great. We should get also add,
So, so that is five serve, David, use, so don't use Ping and Okta, because those are actually hang on one second. So we got, actually got a broad set of companies in there. Yeah, you got clear, right? That's the clear. Yes, okay, that's great. We should get also add,
So, so that is five serve, David, use, so don't use Ping and Okta, because those are actually hang on one second. So we got, actually got a broad set of companies in there. Yeah, you got clear, right? That's the clear. Yes, okay, that's great. We should get also add,

S Speaker 19:49would be equivalent of these, the stripes. No, you have the block. I think that's okay. What does Varian do?
would be equivalent of these, the stripes. No, you have the block. I think that's okay. What does Varian do?
would be equivalent of these, the stripes. No, you have the block. I think that's okay. What does Varian do?
would be equivalent of these, the stripes. No, you have the block. I think that's okay. What does Varian do?
9:57Varan, I don't remember right now. It was. One second. Okay,
Varan, I don't remember right now. It was. One second. Okay,
Varan, I don't remember right now. It was. One second. Okay,
Varan, I don't remember right now. It was. One second. Okay,
S Speaker 110:00that's fine. It's a very low multiple, so it's fine to keep.
that's fine. It's a very low multiple, so it's fine to keep.
that's fine. It's a very low multiple, so it's fine to keep.
that's fine. It's a very low multiple, so it's fine to keep.
10:07We can also add PayPal, right?
We can also add PayPal, right?
We can also add PayPal, right?
We can also add PayPal, right?
S Speaker 110:11PayPal is a service, right? So,
PayPal is a service, right? So,
PayPal is a service, right? So,
PayPal is a service, right? So,
10:15Isn't that okay?
S Speaker 110:17We can, I mean, do you know it's fine? We have all the different variations of okay, even clear is a service. But even with this, this comes out high, right? Yeah, just go up a bit. Priyesh, you assume 20% dilution at exit. I haven't No, not yet. Okay, just add that in 20% dilution. Assume follow on what is a it's 3.7% right? So we'll have to assume a follow on of, Oh, it'll be higher than if we assume a 50 million, yeah,
We can, I mean, do you know it's fine? We have all the different variations of okay, even clear is a service. But even with this, this comes out high, right? Yeah, just go up a bit. Priyesh, you assume 20% dilution at exit. I haven't No, not yet. Okay, just add that in 20% dilution. Assume follow on what is a it's 3.7% right?
