S Speaker 21:20and over there, oh, I agree. Every time, like we have our off sites there, every time I go there, I don't want to come back. But possibly most I get what you're saying, just like a pleasure to meet very quickly. Just want to check is, is axonic and Europe headquartered company, or is it in your US company, depending we would loop in our Europe team or the US team for the discussions.

S Speaker 31:46Yeah, it's both. I'd say we were founded in Europe, but we are flipping over to have the parent company be in the US.

S Speaker 21:54And that transition is ongoing, or has that already happened? It will be finished up by your end, okay, okay, that's, that's great to know. That's, that's great. Jessica, I'm happy to give you a brief overview about my background and how the fund operates, and we can kick it off from there, just to set the context, we are just starting a deep market sort of research on AI observability and memory, possibly will tackle it separately, but I was just catching up with May, and she mentioned axonic And the amazing work that you guys are doing. So would love to have an intro chat here. Happy to also loop in few more members of my team in the further conversations going ahead. And then, to kick it off. I am Priyesh. I'm a Senior Associate here in the team. I've been with the Fund for two years. Prior to that, I've spent another two years in venture with Menlo Ventures in the bay and with Morpheus ventures in LA. The fund. We are corporate venture arm of Qualcomm, so we invest out of the balance sheet. Typically aim to deploy about 100 $50 million a year. And check sizes are quite varied, given we have very stage agnostic. So we have done say early stage seed rounds of $1.5 million to late stage pre IPO rounds of $15 million so spreads quite the gamut. Very big focus on AI as well as infra and applications. We have made a lot of investments in foundation model infra companies in the past, AI being a very core focus area for us, especially because Jessica said some context here. Qualcomm, the corporate has been expanding from being, say, a mobile and networking player to now having its silicon going to PCs, XR automotives, and then we also have a cloud inferencing chip now recently announced. So we are expanding across a lot of different platforms, and we feel there are a lot of ecosystem partnerships, GTM partnerships, engineering partnerships, that we can go into with prospects and companies we invest in. So that's on the strategic value add part. We also have a Qualcomm AI hub, which is in partnership with hugging face, one of our portfolio companies. And there we host a lot of infra solutions and expose those solutions to our native developer audience. So that could be an interesting proposition as well. So a lot, a lot of those partnership opportunities can come along. And I mentioned check sizes, anything specific that I can answer from the fund side?

S Speaker 24:42not really. So we have, it's a global fund. We have six different offices. We have some members in our Europe office, if, say, the founding team, and most of the team is based in Europe, it would be more wise for us to just route the entire discussion through our Europe team. So that is what I was trying to coach.

S Speaker 36:17Before that cloud, different cloud spaces and different startups. I'm definitely a builder at heart. When I left Anaconda, they're like, Are you sure you don't want to stay? And I'm like, so I really want to go back to building. You know, this was an amazing ride. I learned so much, but I definitely like to get my hands a little bit dirty and be a part of that space where you're really trying to figure kind of things out, the market position and so forth.

S Speaker 37:19Yeah, all right, I'll go through all of the normal suspect, the people the problem we're tackling, how we're positioning the product, our pipeline, and how we think about that, as well as some of the financials and the performance. So from the people side, this is our European founders, your room and Allard are both still with the company today. They have so much tribal knowledge. Both of them are fairly technical by education and trade, which is great, and they come from both trifork. Trifork is a deep tech consulting firm, and they spin out different projects, and if it has legs, they then make them a company, and they go for it. Elastic came out of trifork as an example. So definitely understands the open source community. So they were working for triforks fund this product out and then made it its own. Prior to that, you can see they've been at different larger companies. Our lead investor is AVP, which is both global here in the US as well as in Europe. And then volta is a European boutique consultancy as well. So this is where it all started, and this is where we really got our feet wet with event sourcing. They built a fantastic, fantastic following, tons of users, but was really trying to figure out how to commercialize, yeah. So that's they brought on Barry Liebert and myself. Barry serves as our chairman of the board. I'm the CEO. We were both at amaconda together, right? Barry was the Chairman and CEO the last two years or so at Anaconda, and I was the president and COO but we worked together before that at Anaconda for five years or so. So know each other really well, have deep respect for each other. Again, saw that revenue growth. We did go through a license change and a know your customer journey there with the open source products. And when Barry came in as CEO, we were about 40 million, and we took it to about 100 over 100 million in less than 12 months, right? And so as hyper growth, we were burning about 3 million a month.

S Speaker 317:13The obligatory logo page that you can see here that there's many different verticals that that we're in the common thread here, as I said, is they have tons of data. They want to have intelligence of what is going on inside of not just the data, but the application itself, of why are things happening? When is it happening? How is it happening? Who is pushing different things? So they can then explain so I would say our, our, our software really is an explainability layer as you're building on top.

S Speaker 318:03Yeah, for sure, I'm trying to think of there's so many. One that's probably the easiest to understand is like Wells Fargo as an example, like credit score and those types of decisions as they're feeding in and making decisions based off of said application, and then so once for the audit piece of then being able to then tell regulators, this is why Jessica was declined, but her Yash was accepted, right? But also as they start getting into AI, and parts of that workflow being augmented with AI and then eventually autonomous with AI, they need all of the kind of that engine of what has happened in the past, not just the current state of right now. Yeah, another use case is we have a very large grocer that uses us for fulfillment, right? FedEx uses us for a lot the Lost packages segment of their technology. So it's very much, I'd say, use cases where lots of decisions are being made by distributed systems or stakeholders. Yeah, and you need to understand the themes and patterns of what's going on to then make better predictions in the future.

Got it and the platform is on the bottom layer is the event sourcing, kind of all of the gnarly underbelly of the very technical piece. We've then built an intelligence layer that then takes the brilliance and the kind of ledger of all of the decisions that the foundation layer is observing, right, and then it powers the application and AI layer, which then you can query and say, Hey, why was q2 down? And it will say, Oh, it looks like it's because x happened, which then, you know, made this thing happen, which made this thing happen, which made this thing happen versus, you know, yes, it's down by 10% and it happened that that's time.

S Speaker 220:45And just top level, top level question there, Jessica on, say, a very macro level, how does the intelligence layer work? Is it more, I would say, causal ml, discovery platform now, or do you have, say, agents forms and you do a brute force Take, take a look at every log and figure out the final reason behind it?

S Speaker 325:52yeah, I'd say, if I had to say one that we hear about the most, it's probably Kafka and Consulate. But we're actually better together, because Kafka just does streaming, yeah, of the events, whereas there's no persistence, right? It's we literally just hired there. We hired a VP of sales, and she comes from consulate, and internally, they call it the dumb pipe, where it's like, we have to get our pipe smarter, and that's how we get your pipe smarter. So there's a lot of synergy there that I think a partnership may happen at some point. But regardless, a lot of our customers use Kafka, but they also want not just the pipe, but to understand what is going on inside of that pipe and storing it and being persistent, that's where we come in.

S Speaker 326:48high level. This is a snapshot of the roadmap. I'd say a few things to point out is just to continue iterating on some of the agents that we talked about, but also leaning into more visibility, you'll see like different dashboards and verification type things to just give enterprise comfort about using AI. And I think through a lot of our research, we feel like trust is kind of the bottleneck of people leaning into that also more functionality beyond just Java today. So Java is our main ecosystem that we play in, which is great, because most enterprises are in Java. But we do have kind of the, I don't know what the kind of connector kits, if you will, that will start working with python.net, Golang, other types of popular languages second half of the year. Yeah, and then, as well as monolithic code having so right now, when we do back end development and that code assist, it's based off of prompting in q1 we're releasing, being able to ingest code itself and then refactor the code, versus that starting with a

S Speaker 328:29So we're in this weird place, and it sounds like your Qualcomm is flexible. We just did a recap series, a show you this. I me show you this. We just did a recap. We set a solid 5 million, 4 million of it was our existing investors taking that. They said we want 1 million left on the table for a US investor, just because we're moving to the US and we know we want Series B to be led by a US investor, but let's get someone in now to take a little bit of it. Maybe they get a discount on B moving. We think that will likely be end of next year, maybe beginning of 2027, but the valuation is very favorable. It's 15 million pre money, 20 million post money. We're at 6 million. Arr, so less than three times. It's just great, a one time flip. So the cap table is super clean. And I think the reason they're recapping and doing this, you're like, why would you do that? You're doing well, I will say that they've been stagnant for the last three years. It was definitely a more lifestyle company, and they started to shake things up with hiring myself and Barry, and they know investors are a little bit like, yes, that's exciting. They have a new management team that has been there, done that. But also that's a different it's, you know, there's time involved and getting all the engines to run. So that's why it's valued the way it is.

S Speaker 230:07Got it Jessica, certainly very interesting, and I love the story. There's definitely a lot of open source traction, and seems like you you and then Barry, are the right folks to sort of start commercializing it. Now, on a check size perspective, it might be slightly smaller for us, but let me have a chat with the team and get back to you quickly on that. At the same time, I would also like to have one more follow on conversation, including one more partner at my team who leads our dev tools investment.

S Speaker 230:42Yeah, he's way more technical than me, so that would be great, and I can have that schedule sometime early next week. But also for us to make an investment, I think the move to us and the headquarters being relocated here would be a consideration, given that that's eventually where the company would be based, I don't see us sort of involving our European team at the moment, and then for us to make an investment, that move needs to happen. So I'll be transparent on that front, but let me have a chat with the team. Get back to you early next week, set up a follow on call, and we can take it up from there.

S Speaker 331:23Awesome. Yeah, we're like, literally in the filing stage. So it's not just the fault of moving like it's actually happening. We're getting we have to do the board resolutions and all that, but those are being prepped
Awesome. Yeah, we're like, literally in the filing stage. So it's not just the fault of moving like it's actually happening. We're getting we have to do the board resolutions and all that, but those are being prepped
