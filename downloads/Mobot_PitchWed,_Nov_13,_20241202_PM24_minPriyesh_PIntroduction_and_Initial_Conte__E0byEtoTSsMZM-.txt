S Speaker 20:08No absolutely my pleasure meeting you, and thanks a lot for taking the time. I couldn't really make it to the event. I usually try to make it to those events in person, but had to miss it this time. But I was quite excited to know what you guys are building. It's a very interesting approach using robots for mobile testing. I have never seen something like that happen, so I was very curious to learn more. And maybe there's a potential play with Qualcomm down the line that we can support.

1:00so I kind of understand, yeah,
so I kind of understand, yeah,

so I kind of understand, yeah,
S Speaker 21:02yeah, absolutely. I can give you a brief about how the fund is structured, where I play, what areas we look at, and no, we do not really have to have a proof of concept with Qualcomm, and that doesn't need to happen. So I'm a Senior Associate here at Qualcomm. I broadly look at AI and electrification investments for us, the team itself has been around for about 25 years or so. We have 250, plus portfolio companies currently about a billion and a half in assets under management. And it's a global fund. So we are based out of us, Latin America, Israel, China, India, to name a few areas, the fund is structured quite like a financial fund. So while we only have Qualcomm as our LP, we take our independent decisions independently. So we take our decisions like a financial VC would, and down the line, we try to support or make connections for our portfolio companies with Qualcomm, and either they sort of act as a vendor, as a supplier to us or down the line, if there's a potential, maybe an M A target, but that's more or less the strategic fit of things. I would say. Still, the decision is independent. The team is based out of Bay Area and San Diego. We operate as independent arm of Qualcomm, I'd say. And in terms of check sizes, yeah, check sizes are two to ten million we are, preferably a Series A investor at times. We do see it as well, but that's more opportunistic, and we don't have a strategy there as such. And as you can imagine, we have a lot of play in AI, compute infrastructure and downstream. We plan to make a lot of investments in foundation models. We have done a few of them. We are making investments in a lot of AI applications. We have made investments in a few robotic companies, few of computer vision companies, some in XR some in automobile tech stack. So broadly, if you see anything which has an interface with Compute or connectivity. That's where qualcomment just has a good plane.

S Speaker 23:19interest. Absolutely, is there anything specific that I can answer for you before I pass it over to you? Um,

interest. Absolutely, is there anything specific that I can answer for you before I pass it over to you? Um,
S Speaker 13:24I think, yeah, that was my main question. Was just like, I know some Well, I guess is it or do you guys invest off of the Qualcomm balance sheet, or it is structured as a different entity, and they're just like, your LP, so
I think, yeah, that was my main question. Was just like, I know some Well, I guess is it or do you guys invest off of the Qualcomm balance sheet, or it is structured as a different entity, and they're just like, your LP, so

I think, yeah, that was my main question. Was just like, I know some Well, I guess is it or do you guys invest off of the Qualcomm balance sheet, or it is structured as a different entity, and they're just like, your LP, so
S Speaker 23:37we invest out of the balance sheet, within the US, US investments. We have a mandate of deploying about 150 $280 million a year. So that's where our broader targets are. But then it's not a struct. It's not structured as an separate entity, if that's the question, yeah. Okay, yeah.
we invest out of the balance sheet, within the US, US investments. We have a mandate of deploying about 150 $280 million a year. So that's where our broader targets are. But then it's not a struct. It's not structured as an separate entity, if that's the question, yeah. Okay, yeah.

S Speaker 24:11at an interesting time. Absolutely, yeah, I'd be happy to sort of evaluate if there is anything, any potential that Qualcomm as a corporate could have either acting as one of your customers or maybe just a technology partner or anything down the line.

S Speaker 14:26Yeah, okay, yeah. I know you did not have a chance to come to Lama land, but if you had, we actually did bring one of our real robots and we demoed it, and at the event, which was pretty cool. People got to see it. But essentially how it works is we operate Infrastructure as a Service. So in a closet in New York, we have server racks where we've crammed them full of these commoditized robots that basically are gutted three printers, if you will, yeah, or pen plotters, and they are able to execute routines on physical devices. And so a lot of our customers are mobile engineering teams, product teams, marketing teams, that have workflows that need to be executed on physical devices. And how it works is there's as we program the robot, we are now able to take an AI based approach, where you can actually communicate with the robot with a prompt in plain English. And so I'll kind of like, pause the video. You can see in the prompt, there's, of course, like the larger system prompt that instructs, like the whole system. There's a prompt that's like, open it, hear it kind of on the bottom right of the screen, open the app, sign in and go to the Payment History screen. These are like plain English instructions from the customer or from any human. And then what we're doing is we've also built our own infrastructure where there's a series, a sequence of different a library of robot instructions that translates to the physical tabs and gestures that you see. So you can see that we're building a test plan here where we're actually reading the text on the screen. We're parsing for icons, and then we're able to figure out and sort of reason like, oh, okay, if I'm being instructed to do this in natural language, here's the observation. Here's the thought and the action that should be taken. I should click on an icon. I should click on text. I should enter text input. I should drag the screen to scroll. And so they're essentially translating, kind of like the human intentions, from the prompt to a sequence of robot instructions. So mobat is doing, you know, we are in order to do the actual initial configuration, we're modifying off the shelf, large language models for that that I think has been working really well for us. We also for the actual execution of the test. Later, we have our own convolutional neural network model that we've trained on 15 million customer images, and we're continuing to also close that feedback loop, so that's a separate process as well. But what you're seeing here is kind of just like the initial piece of like us, leveraging a large language model to actually basically orchestrate and execute real world work on physical devices, whether it's a touch screen, iOS, Android, a point of sale tablet. It could be a connected device, like a smartwatch or a, you know, kiosk at a grocery store, like long term, you know, the vision for where we're going with mobot is, it's not just about, you know, mobile testing. Let me pull up the slide deck, and we can sort of start going through it. And, yeah, feel free to ask me questions.
Yeah, okay, yeah. I know you did not have a chance to come to Lama land, but if you had, we actually did bring one of our real robots and we demoed it, and at the event, which was pretty cool.

S Speaker 27:45Yeah, I think, I think you are probably taking me there, but I have a sense that, why, why do you want to restrict it just to mobile testing using a robot, the core technology or the infrastructure that you're building could be utilized in a lot of agentic spaces right now, I see a lot of companies trying to do that, so would love your voice over on that.
Yeah, I think, I think you are probably taking me there, but I have a sense that, why, why do you want to restrict it just to mobile testing using a robot, the core technology or the infrastructure that you're building could be utilized in a lot of agentic spaces right now, I see a lot of companies trying to do that, so would love your voice over on that.

S Speaker 110:18Yeah, so I do think that, like the existing, traditional automation market is a lot of web, QA, RPA tools, simulators, emulators, like, if you've heard of Browser Stack or head spin or lambda test, like we we can do some of that too, but like, that's a subset of what we can do, right? We can also do all the hard stuff that nobody else can do, and that is typically outsourced to like an Infosys or an applause or qualitest or some kind of EPO like Fitbit does all of their manual QA through Deloitte in Mexico. And so that's just like a lot of money that you're overpaying for Deloitte branded fingers in Mexico. And that's, I think, the opportunity that we want to go after is that this is not total annual spend, but, like just I interviewed a bunch of random people on different product teams and found out at these different companies, this is, like the example contract size that they were paying. Google has a $12 million applause contract. I'm not saying that's their total QA spend, but that was just an example of a contract you should replace. And then, you know, FanDuel is, like, 400k and so we know that, like, essentially, we're trying to build this physical AI agent to replace human labor, and we've been able to do that already with 70 customers. Like, we're doing about 4 million in ARR, you know, we've seen some patterns and some use cases, and some of that comes from, you know, these, if you look at this list, like, this is what we use on our sales deck, like, base ID, two factor, authentication, localization, web feeds. These are things that you're like, Wait, this is just everyday, normal actions, and they're not automatable on iOS and Android. So it's already a pretty complex use case before we add in all the other form factors, which we would love to do. Right
Yeah, so I do think that, like the existing, traditional automation market is a lot of web, QA, RPA tools, simulators, emulators, like, if you've heard of Browser Stack or head spin or lambda test, like we we can do some of that too, but like, that's a subset of what we can do, right?

Like, we're doing about 4 million in ARR, you know, we've seen some patterns and some use cases, and some of that comes from, you know, these, if you look at this list, like, this is what we use on our sales deck, like, base ID, two factor, authentication, localization, web feeds. These are things that you're like, Wait, this is just everyday, normal actions, and they're not automatable on iOS and Android. So it's already a pretty complex use case before we add in all the other form factors, which we would love to do. Right
Yeah, so I do think that, like the existing, traditional automation market is a lot of web, QA, RPA tools, simulators, emulators, like, if you've heard of Browser Stack or head spin or lambda test, like we we can do some of that too, but like, that's a subset of what we can do, right? We can also do all the hard stuff that nobody else can do, and that is typically outsourced to like an Infosys or an applause or qualitest or some kind of EPO like Fitbit does all of their manual QA through Deloitte in Mexico. And so that's just like a lot of money that you're overpaying for Deloitte branded fingers in Mexico. And that's, I think, the opportunity that we want to go after is that this is not total annual spend, but, like just I interviewed a bunch of random people on different product teams and found out at these different companies, this is, like the example contract size that they were paying. Google has a $12 million applause contract. I'm not saying that's their total QA spend, but that was just an example of a contract you should replace. And then, you know, FanDuel is, like, 400k and so we know that, like, essentially, we're trying to build this physical AI agent to replace human labor, and we've been able to do that already with 70 customers.

S Speaker 212:15and for your contracts that you currently have, Eden, are they recurring in a fashion that Do you have a specific use case for one QA, or are they more reckoning nature and you have, you sort of test every update that goes through, every new patch that goes through.

S Speaker 112:32We often are testing for some customers, daily, weekly, bi weekly. They have different schedules. Different teams are on different schedules even within the same company, but essentially, you purchased an annual contract of a certain number of credits. If you use all the credits early, you have to probably buy a new one, or, you know, you have to pay overages. And so we work with our customers to kind of scope up the appropriate contract for what they need. But the way we get there is by, yeah, like taking a look and scoping, like, what is the labor you're currently doing? Give us the checklist, and we'll literally automate it. And that's what gets back into the demo that you saw. Like the open the app and go to the payment history. A lot of these enterprises already have those instructions written out, and it's either they're trying to automate some of it with Appium or in Browser Stack or something, and they're only able to do a portion of that test in those systems. And then they some of those other use cases that I mentioned are not actually automatable, so they end up having manual labor

S Speaker 113:47Yeah, the company's been around for about six years. But of course, like the first year was just me as a solo founder, kind of working on it on the side. And then we went through Y Combinator, you know, and close to seed round, coming out of YC Demo Day in 2019 then we raised our series, a led by Coda capital, in early 2022 The reason we're talking now is that, you know, there is an opportunity to we're raising an extension to that round, and there's also a larger financing that We're considering for next year,

S Speaker 214:20right? I'd love to know a little bit more about the deal details, and maybe if you can send me the deck, I would like to do a little bit of research about the space myself. I don't think I'm as familiar with the market, but it seems quite big. I was surprised to know the spends for some of these companies. That's pretty interesting, especially that they outsource a lot of this work to manual BPOS. That's that's interesting as well. How large are your contract sizes right now for some of your customers, and like, what's the variance there?

16:03you know, like the size of Browser Stack, yeah,
you know, like the size of Browser Stack, yeah,
you know, like the size of Browser Stack, yeah,
you know, like the size of Browser Stack, yeah,
S Speaker 116:05I think that's so constrained with the technology and what they can do. And mobat can do way more than that, because we have the robotics that are more flexible. And so another example is best by health, you know, they signed with us last year, and then partway through, you know, they realized, oh, wow, we can actually do way more with mobot than just like the old the hard cases. So they upgraded to 100% coverage. Then they incurred some overages, and then now we've renewed for a second year. You know, I think that number is actually higher than this. It's closer to 200,000 and we think the total contract there's a there's a couple of additional projects they're signing up for in 2025 that if, if those get approved internally at Best Buy health, they're going to need to use mobile for those as well. Yeah. So we think the total contract value for Best Buy health could be over half a million dollars in 2025 but that's conditional upon those other projects getting approved,
I think that's so constrained with the technology and what they can do. And mobat can do way more than that, because we have the robotics that are more flexible.

S Speaker 217:03right? That's That's pretty interesting. Eden, so I'm assuming robots Iran aren't a very big part of your cogs. Is that a fair assumption to say

right? That's That's pretty interesting. Eden, so I'm assuming robots Iran aren't a very big part of your cogs. Is that a fair assumption to say
S Speaker 117:16that is correct? The biggest part of our cogs, 90% of it actually comes from the data annotation, labor pet so in a post LLM world, it's easier, but as you know, llms are not perfect, and we still have to annotate a lot of customer data and clean things up in order to get the automation to work. Well, we have 70% gross margins, which is not bad, but yes, most of it actually comes from labor. The reason we're able to do this is because you saw the video of the robots. It's just a pen plotter or a 3d printer. So when we were first starting the company, I hired an engineer from MakerBot to basically duplicate what a 3d printer does, but, you know, strip out the elements you don't need. And so we can assemble the robots using commoditized parts. Each robot costs about $1,000 and we think each robot can probably generate over 350,000 in ARR per year. And the life, accelerated lifetime testing tells us each robot can probably run for about three years with minimal maintenance. And so I think, like, that's kind of been working well for us. And the only reason we built our own robots was because no one else was making them cheap enough that it made sense for the unit economics. But I think it has become, you know, as a result, like a bit of a proprietary advantage in how we operationalize the whole tech stack. And then, of course, the way we've that we've applied our own firmware, our own software, our own convolutional neural network model, and the way that we are also applying these llms, I think all of that has kind of been this proprietary sauce.

S Speaker 218:55it. Got it. Even this is interesting. I do have to jump at 1230 so I would like to ask you if there's anything that I should have asked that I haven't already and then probably spend the last few minutes talking about the current deal in process, and you plan to be raising a larger round down the line.

S Speaker 120:46it's looking like somewhere, but like three to 4 million is an extension, Coda capital, heavybit and uncorrelated ventures are you know, of course, our existing investors who are very much engaged and want to be in that round. We do have some existing or some new investors that we've been meeting through Lama lounge and others that are expressing interest. So we're trying to figure out if we need to squeeze in or increase that, and kind of how that will be. But like, yeah, the eight the last round was at like 47 post.

S Speaker 121:51Yeah, of course. I guess out of curiosity, you mentioned previously that your minimum sort of check size is like 2 million. I think that is in alignment with potentially what we're currently looking to do in this extension. But curious, like, how you guys, if you feel like the you know, the current terms and structure I've sort of mentioned, like, Does that seem like something that your team is open to?
Yeah, of course. I guess out of curiosity, you mentioned previously that your minimum sort of check size is like 2 million.

S Speaker 222:12Yes, we would be open. Our sweet spot typically is between five to seven. So we want to have at least about we plan to get about five to 10% of ownership when we invest so in that aspect, it might be slightly smaller for us, but we do plan like we do expect to invest smaller check sizes opportunistically. So I'd like to evaluate that from that perspective, I would say the next round would be more sweeter for us, given that perfectly fits in our investment mandates, but I'd still like to make a push for evaluating this for the current round as well.
