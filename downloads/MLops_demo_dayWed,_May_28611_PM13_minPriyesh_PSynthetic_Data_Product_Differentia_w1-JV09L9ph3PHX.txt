the market? I mean, I guess like, so what you're saying, right? So I think they took that directly from our website and our core product, tonic, structural has been around for like, six years. And mainly, like, that's probably the most use case that most resonated with, like software development and testing, and just like having a realistic data to mess with and find drugs. So that's like, that's what they like. Why for unstructured data, that part is more like use cases related to model training are the most common, actually. So like, kind of different from what you see on the side, but yeah, more like model training use cases for the unstructured data product. But another thing that's different is, you know, synthetic data, people can like, kind of, this means a lot of things, right. For two of our products, it's more like a it's more of like a masking products, like, we take the real data and then we, like, synthesize the sensitive elements to it, and that way you maintain, like, the realism of the data. That was just a hard thing to synthetic data, right? Yeah. How do you know if it's good enough? So, so that's, that's like, do our products do that? And we have one product that's just more like a complete data from scratch, product like, that's more like

the, I guess I'm for data from Scratch project, I'm not sure. I think for like, in terms of the synthetic elements that we replace it with our products. A lot of the times it's, like, based on, you know, the distributions of the data. And so we kind of match it to make sure it's realistic. Same thing with like this, this, like, if John is since, like, John is synthesized through Alfonso and one part of your document, it'll hold me up also the other part of the document. So we maintain that consistency as well. So like, there's just kind of a bunch of things that we do there to try to make that we do to make sure

structured data product, a lot of times that's been in the healthcare that is where the name of the most just because they have to comply with Empath and but we do have some in other industries are a structured product.

This is a two step process that's running. We take the photo. Step one, we generate baml code. Baml is our own programming language that we made that makes models cheaper, faster, better, without fine tune it. Step two, we run that bamboo code. That's what you get out, sorry, off the bat, on the fly, and you can use it. That's probably something a little bit more

Okay, the models can generate ammo code without with like, 20 lines of props, yeah. So here's how family code works. So the theory is really that I hate doing this, like, you guys remember when we wrote websites like this? Who likes this? Right over here? This is better. I think we all agree it's better for a variety of reasons, primarily because, one, it's pretty colors. We all like pretty colors. But two, you get static analysis component. We're going through all these optimizations that react can do for you that you don't have to think about. You ever seen prompts like this where you just smash a bunch of s strings together? That's HTML. That's useless. You can't do static analysis on that. You can't build on top of that. It's a house of cards that will break.

These are prompt so we turn prompts. Fuck the word prompt. It's a new word. We don't need that. We just need functions. Functions taken inputs. Functions have outputs. Outputs are defined in code. Fuck English. English is not bad. Functions are not

closer as you tighten real time, you only guess what it is. No one's sending the prop turn. You can see it. You can read your prop. Then you actually just press play. You see the object. And you'll notice here the thing the models spit out is not dialoguing. It's not going to close. That's totally garbage. It doesn't matter. We pull it out, we turn this thing that is useless into something that is useful. We do this without structured output. It happens in real time, in the two milliseconds on your own system. You'll watch it happen. It fills it in as it goes. We do that because we're really fucking good at algorithms. It's all open source. Runs locally in your machine, completely game against it works in highly secure environments. So everyone you saw right now is completely open source as you're going about it.

investing in follow ventures. I'm not a technical guy, so a lot of Professor but what i What's very impressive for us is that you mentioned a lot of your code runs on device. How big is the model today, and what device you can use anymore, right? And what devices can IT support? It's interesting. Would love to do a deep dive here. If you're open, what we what I feel, is just the running on on device. Part of it, we feel we can unlock a lot of GTM for you. And would love to have a chat around investment as well. From that perspective, sounds great. Sounds great. Would love to set up a time sometime to chat further. I can do a little bit of my own research to come back with better questions, and

From that perspective, sounds great. Sounds great. Would love to set up a time sometime to chat further. I can do a little bit of my own research to come back with better questions, and
investing in follow ventures. I'm not a technical guy, so a lot of Professor but what i What's very impressive for us is that you mentioned a lot of your code runs on device.

Sounds great. I'll follow up.

Speaker 1
very interesting space built to be quite loyal. And somebody is a synthetic leader. I see you have specifically mentioned software development and testing. How does that differentiate you from other synthetic players in
Speaker 2
the market? I mean, I guess like, so what you're saying, right? So I think they took that directly from our website and our core product, tonic, structural has been around for like, six years. And mainly, like, that's probably the most use case that most resonated with, like software development and testing, and just like having a realistic data to mess with and find drugs. So that's like, that's what they like. Why for unstructured data, that part is more like use cases related to model training are the most common, actually. So like, kind of different from what you see on the side, but yeah, more like model training use cases for the unstructured data product. But another thing that's different is, you know, synthetic data, people can like, kind of, this means a lot of things, right. For two of our products, it's more like a it's more of like a masking products, like, we take the real data and then we, like, synthesize the sensitive elements to it, and that way you maintain, like, the realism of the data. That was just a hard thing to synthetic data, right? Yeah. How do you know if it's good enough? So, so that's, that's like, do our products do that? And we have one product that's just more like a complete data from scratch, product like, that's more like
Speaker 1
the data and the platform is standalone synthetic data generator. Do you sort of tie in with a few other platforms? How does it work overall? I mean,
Speaker 2
the, I guess I'm for data from Scratch project, I'm not sure. I think for like, in terms of the synthetic elements that we replace it with our products. A lot of the times it's, like, based on, you know, the distributions of the data. And so we kind of match it to make sure it's realistic. Same thing with like this, this, like, if John is since, like, John is synthesized through Alfonso and one part of your document, it'll hold me up also the other part of the document. So we maintain that consistency as well. So like, there's just kind of a bunch of things that we do there to try to make that we do to make sure
Speaker 1
that we can get the realism right. And who are your customers today? What kind of customers are you targeting? So for our
Speaker 2
structured data product, a lot of times that's been in the healthcare that is where the name of the most just because they have to comply with Empath and but we do have some in other industries are a structured product. It's like we kind of have, across all industries, but particularly a lot of financial services, right?
Speaker 1
Interesting. So I'm an investor. I would love to talk to someone who takes care of fundraising. If there's an opportunity sometimes coming soon, is there someone I can connect to you? I
Speaker 2
mean, I Yeah. I mean, I guess if we connect your LinkedIn, I can give you that information, yeah, that sounds okay. I can give you my name, or if you want, you can connect, you know, you can add your information in there. Somebody will reach out to you.
Speaker 1
Okay, sounds good. For sure. Would love to connect with you as well on LinkedIn. I'm sorry I didn't get your name, Shannon. Nice to meet
You. Shannon, Can You
something called Lorain.
Speaker 3
It's able to specialize contacts. They use the same thing, they use Lora for specific contacts, and they have reward function for each context. So that's one kind
Speaker 4
of content to do. Product And it's generating
Speaker 4
up live demo? Hey guys, sorry to interrupt real quickly. I'm Jay did with a couple minutes when our speakers come on the microphone, if you can keep them to an aggressive whisper,
we would appreciate it. You. Possible.
Speaker 5
This is a two step process that's running. We take the photo. Step one, we generate baml code. Baml is our own programming language that we made that makes models cheaper, faster, better, without fine tune it. Step two, we run that bamboo code. That's what you get out, sorry, off the bat, on the fly, and you can use it. That's probably something a little bit more
practical, because that isn't very useful. Maybe
Speaker 5
I'm a restaurant. I want to update my menu. This is zero shot, no fine tuning. Use off the shelf. Model doesn't really matter. You can use any model of
Speaker 6
your choice, like what do you mean by
Speaker 5
it's a new programming like, you know, JavaScript is a great language for writing websites. We're a great language for writing AI applications. Okay, yeah, but like, you just check it out right
Speaker 6
there. But most of the models don't have, like, data models.
It's that easy. It works anyway.
Speaker 5
Okay, the models can generate ammo code without with like, 20 lines of props, yeah. So here's how family code works. So the theory is really that I hate doing this, like, you guys remember when we wrote websites like this? Who likes this? Right over here? This is better. I think we all agree it's better for a variety of reasons, primarily because, one, it's pretty colors. We all like pretty colors. But two, you get static analysis component. We're going through all these optimizations that react can do for you that you don't have to think about. You ever seen prompts like this where you just smash a bunch of s strings together? That's HTML. That's useless. You can't do static analysis on that. You can't build on top of that. It's a house of cards that will break.
That's what we fix. Here's how we do that.
Speaker 5
These are prompt so we turn prompts. Fuck the word prompt. It's a new word. We don't need that. We just need functions. Functions taken inputs. Functions have outputs. Outputs are defined in code. Fuck English. English is not bad. Functions are not
bad. We're gonna write some English
here. The magic is you have to
write test cases, and then we live in two links. So
for firstly, you can see your full prop in real time,
easily. I'm gonna whisper, so you might have to come
Speaker 5
closer as you tighten real time, you only guess what it is. No one's sending the prop turn. You can see it. You can read your prop. Then you actually just press play. You see the object. And you'll notice here the thing the models spit out is not dialoguing. It's not going to close. That's totally garbage. It doesn't matter. We pull it out, we turn this thing that is useless into something that is useful. We do this without structured output. It happens in real time, in the two milliseconds on your own system. You'll watch it happen. It fills it in as it goes. We do that because we're really fucking good at algorithms. It's all open source. Runs locally in your machine, completely game against it works in highly secure environments. So everyone you saw right now is completely open source as you're going about it. And then eventually you'll want to go to your like, Python code, Java code, Typekit code, movie code, go code, whatever you want. Family plugs into the window of your choice, and it turns into binding the database. Extract resume to go to
function, resume, dot name is a string. That's
Speaker 5
why getting over here is a string. I changed my panel, make a string array. This becomes a string array.
This becomes a
Speaker 6
string array. Screening. This becomes so the benefits of the is
Speaker 5
our sea tax with a beautiful and the iteration loop, we just turned your prompt generation testing loop to two seconds, to two minutes. You're gonna find a better prompt before you
quit. Can I set up the tests myself?
Speaker 5
Everything is hooked. Everything goes in equipment. It's all open source. If you scan, if you're uncomfortable, I'm
Speaker 1
investing in follow ventures. I'm not a technical guy, so a lot of Professor but what i What's very impressive for us is that you mentioned a lot of your code runs on device. How big is the model today, and what device you can use anymore, right? And what devices can IT support? It's interesting. Would love to do a deep dive here. If you're open, what we what I feel, is just the running on on device. Part of it, we feel we can unlock a lot of GTM for you. And would love to have a chat around investment as well. From that perspective, sounds great. Sounds great. Would love to set up a time sometime to chat further. I can do a little bit of my own research to come back with better questions, and
then yeah,
Sounds great. I'll follow up.
It personally,
just like It
maybe for 90.
