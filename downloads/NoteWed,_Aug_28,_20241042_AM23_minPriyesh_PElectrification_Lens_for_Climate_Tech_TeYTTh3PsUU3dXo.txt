S Speaker 10:06I want to do with a lens on electrification. Agree. Okay, so climate tech is very broad. You know, cement, fusion, nitrogen, right? Everything we do should be with the lens of electrification, because we've done some exercise a while ago on, hey, that's what climate tech is, right? And this one is on what is, what is electrification understood. So I'll try to change this, this chart from climate tech to electrification, if I can do that, yeah, okay, you can say climate as a broad category exist. And if we double click on what, what we're excited about or you want to focus on, you know, you can keep this, but you need to add the electrification piece. Understood, understood. So from the next slide itself, I think we will be honing down into electrification. This would give them a broader understanding of how the value chain is and where we want to be playing. And then broadly, want to focus on six themes. In a sense, outdated infrastructure. Grids are over 25 years old. There's a lifetime value of 50 years. There has to be more maintenance and more investment in the space, generation is being distributed. Transmission is very proactively reacting to demand, so there is opportunity for a lot of system orchestrators here. Interconnections are increasing, which means there will be more load on the grid. The end point itself, the consumption point on this one, yeah, this one caught my attention, that there's a big queue, right? So we know that it's easy. The technology to do solar to the wind is existing, but I can't just go into an offshore wind project if I can't interconnect into the grid. Yeah, right. So this one is, and I assume that that's high voltage, and I don't know. So you know the story about high voltage, low voltage, right? Low Voltage is beyond, is behind the behind the transformers, high voltage, yeah, from the depending on where you're looking from, right? And then when, once it gets to sort of city level, it's low voltage, yes, right, transmission to distribution, yeah. This,

S Speaker 12:35on a this Qualcomm have a play in high voltage. I
S Speaker 12:42okay. And, and does the Q problem? Is it a high voltage phenomenon, or at the low voltage? Again, I think it's high voltage. My point is this Q thing, interconnect. Q is big. It's a hindrance. Should we do? Can we call common ventures? Do something about it, or should we not care? We just say yes, it's a problem, but it's, you know, somebody else's hand.

S Speaker 13:13need, we need to have a position on this. Okay? We need this a conclusion. We need to say yes, we're gonna look here. No, we're not gonna look here. But I think I agree it's a big problem. Got it, got it understood. And then there's a theme of electrify everything. So demand is going up, plus the consumption points are becoming generation points. And lastly, grid security. I'm not sure if we will be honing in into this, but I've put it for now, no doubt it becomes an issue, especially as these assets are more digital than than mechanical, right, or just just old school electric. This slide is good. This slide talks about what are the pain points? My suggestion is, then we pick two or three. These are the boxes that we want to double click on right again. You know? These are the boxes that are relevant to Qualcomm. And initially we want to focus on this. Maybe even security is relevant. But hey, we say, you know, we'll look at security after we've learned some of the other stuff, because, by definition, security is a little bit more removed from us, right? Yeah, so I would rather focus on deals that are little closer to us understood. So how I've been thinking Carlos is this distributed generation and poor planning, these two boxes then go on and feed into grid operations, broader sub sector. This is where we talk about that. Grid operations has not been very perfect. There's an opportunity for orchestrators which can match demand to supply, be more proactive. And these are the companies which play in that space. And then talking to a few more companies will and there will be another slide here which can which will say that these are the companies. This is how this trend is shaping these this is how these companies are working. This is what it means to be a winner in the space. So these two would feed into grid operations, outdated infrastructure and increasing interconnections feed into grid maintenance, which is like the transmission lines are outdated, transformers that are outdated, there is big enough interconnection line. And similarly, here's the market map for that sub sector. And when we talk to enough, this is what it means to be winning in this segment. And lastly, complex consumer consumption endpoints is basically the vehicle to this is a sub sector wherein it's all about energy efficiency, Home Energy Management, vehicle to grid kind of spaces. So this is the final market map for that sector. Okay, now, how
need, we need to have a position on this. Okay? We need this a conclusion. We need to say yes, we're gonna look here. No, we're not gonna look here. But I think I agree it's a big problem.

S Speaker 16:07These are mostly on desktop research. So there were a couple of lists on the best performing companies in this space. There's a climate 50 list research. Some through those met one one. I've met one VC in this space, so got a few names from him, but I have, like, I've been researching them and working on them, and I have about

S Speaker 16:37this spreadsheet, was you populate this by hand, or was this something that you automated? Created the scraping that is pulling the data? Yeah, this, this has been automated. What has been bolded in here has been done by hand, and this column has been done by hand. Okay, but what's the source of this data? PitchBook. It's PitchBook. Few other articles, crunch, base Tech Crunch, kind of things, anything that is your automation engine,

like grid maintenance, grid enhancement, grid operations. To me, each of these are
like grid maintenance, grid enhancement, grid operations. To me, each of these are
like grid maintenance, grid enhancement, grid operations. To me, each of these are
S Speaker 111:58they intersecting, but I would say that when I said, here's some trends, like, your slide number four, to me is like the trends? Yes, okay, yeah, here's, here's what's happening. Maybe this a different way. Maybe we end up making 222, slides here, right? But here's some trends and some answers to the trends. So this feels like smells like that. Yeah, right, yeah. Then you say, then you go to some mapping, which is like, there's different people are doing, you know, different things, right? So that you know that is like a slide, like a typical pitch book slide, there's companies doing this kind of stuff. There's companies doing that kind of stuff, etc, right? Yeah, that would be like a layer up from slide six. It feels like slide six is double clicking on one of the sectors, right? Versus a layer up is like all of these next to each other. Yeah, right. So it's a market map, if you will. Yeah, okay. And then, and then you go to this. So then we say, of the market cap map, we think that sub, sub map, three, five and seven are the ones that are most relevant to Qualcomm, understood. And that's like print operations in the subnet, yeah, understood, okay, yeah. And then we say, and then we talk to in this line, we talk to, you know, three companies, right? And then we say, Okay, here's some learnings, some insights,
they intersecting, but I would say that when I said, here's some trends, like, your slide number four, to me is like the trends? Yes, okay, yeah, here's, here's what's happening.

S Speaker 113:46and then last slide is like, recommendations. Got it initial, initial recommendations. Does
and then last slide is like, recommendations. Got it initial, initial recommendations. Does
and then last slide is like, recommendations. Got it initial, initial recommendations. Does
and then last slide is like, recommendations. Got it initial, initial recommendations. Does
S Speaker 114:00fair enough. So I'll have energy certificates and energy marketplaces in that meaning, just to wrap up, this is sort of a working framework, right? We do an initial cut, like an 80% of the way there, and then in the next iteration, we double click and we get to, you know, 90% 95 meaning, out of that, we get some good prospect FYI. I don't think we need to have strong I mean, we can have prospect FYI is here, but not stage one candidates. Maybe, maybe prospect FY X is a result of this. Yeah, understood. Prosperity for guys might be raising at this moment, might not be, but still worth putting,
fair enough. So I'll have energy certificates and energy marketplaces in that meaning, just to wrap up, this is sort of a working framework, right? We do an initial cut, like an 80% of the way there, and then in the next iteration, we double click and we get to, you know, 90% 95 meaning, out of that, we get some good prospect FYI. I don't think we need to have strong I mean, we can have prospect FYI is here, but not stage one candidates. Maybe, maybe prospect FY X is a result of this. Yeah, understood. Prosperity for guys might be raising at this moment, might not be, but still worth putting,

14:49yeah, yeah. And by the way, just like, I mean,
S Speaker 114:55I always say, you can, you can push any deal through, if you want to, right, we could jump on we've grid, and say, Oh, this is great, but the reality is, we're trying to understand the market. I don't know if we've grid is set up to be a matter of success or not. What they're doing sounds interesting. So yes, it's an FYI.

S Speaker 115:20Even though there's an opportunity, we could push it. We could say, oh, there's an opportunity that's invest, right? I'm not ready to do it. You know, valuation aside, I'm not ready to do it that, yes, this whole this will be a winner, because we haven't. We don't understand the competitive landscape. There's different people doing different things that are similar, right? Yeah, and so I don't have the conviction to go and say, Yeah, we need to invest, because there's an opportunity to invest. Agreed, agree, Okay, understood. Few other spaces there is, there has been a lot. There are a lot of companies on the battery O and M side, they do predictive analytics, better operation, better operations for battery manufacturers, predicting the life cycle of a battery. Kind of thing do we want to go there? Should that be a part of the market map?

S Speaker 117:19I would put it, I would put it in master map and say, hey to initially, where we recommend for, you know, looking at, you know, this, this and that battery sounds interesting. It's something we should revisit after we've done a few things here, right? We can't do everything at once, right? We can't, we don't have time. We don't have to bandwidth,

S Speaker 117:43some things we double click on, versus study everything ad nauseam, right? Because we're not going to do a comprehensive study. Got it. Got it. And last question on the market map, Carlos. There are a few companies which are in the Home Energy Efficiency space. But they are more from they're tackling it more from a services perspective, like they have a few data models which allows you to understand install smart thermostats in this place, and model this entire thing in a specific way. But it's more of a services company. This one, I think, is interesting. The two reasons I know we have teams looking at home, manager, management systems, okay, yeah, two, it always becomes a question, is this

S Speaker 118:36cloud, AI, right? Is an opportunity. And again, conceptually sounds interesting, and that we can form an opinion. Look, we think that it only makes sense this kind of stuff makes sense to have on the cloud or on device. Yeah, right. My sense it would be on the cloud with the aggregation of various homes, because the utility can then say, okay, I can modulate these homes, right? Versus individually. But that's a conjecture, by the way. Spend does some of this right? Spend does have some ability to control individually circuit levels, right? And spend two sees that. Their view is, we become the energy router to the house. Yeah, but we enter and we integrate the house with a grid. And then, you know, it's not, yes, you can do it alone, on your own, but if you have a better solution, if, you have an aggregate of a jobs,

S Speaker 119:44got it, but yes, the answer to that one is Yes, got it more relevant that the battery. I think the battery will become relevant today. It's not, not. There's nobody talking about like batteries, other than, you know, mobile mobile batteries, mobile phone batteries. Yes, but got it got it got us so understood. I have my answers. I'll start working on it. Found this pretty interesting resource today. I thought I've done all the desktop research possible, but this is a US Department of Energy Report, and they have run some pretty interesting experiments on a lot of things, what the grid requires anticipated expansion, and it's a 300 page document. So there's tons of resource in here. I'll go through this, try to find a good way to read through this. Can you get GPT to summarize this? Yeah, I'm not sure if it will cover everything. It's 300 pages. Maybe I'll break the PDF down into smaller fractions and send it to something sounds good.

S Speaker 120:56Friday, Friday should be good. I can work on a few things and then come back on Friday. Okay, good. And question, Should we plan on reaching out to startups in a specific way? Yes, when? Let's pick the startups, right? Let's pick a few. Yeah, that's, you know, we should, we should start to pick a few. And then we need to see, you know, where do we know the investors ask for intros, etc. Okay, got it so we can do that on Friday. Yes, okay, sounds good. Okay, bye, and we should also talk to some investors, but let's talk Friday first. Let's continue to double click here. All right, understood. All right. Good. Good job. Priyesh, thank you.
