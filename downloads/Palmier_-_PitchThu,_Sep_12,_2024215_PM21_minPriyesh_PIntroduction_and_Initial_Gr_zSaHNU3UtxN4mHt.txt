1:18Thank you. Thank you. Where are you dial you from,
S Speaker 11:20I'm in San Mateo right now. So the Bay Area. Most of the team from Qualcomm ventures in the Bay Area, some of us are in San Diego, where the headquarters is. Yeah, where are you based?

1:40Absolutely, absolutely you're enjoying it there.
1:44Yeah, the weather is so nice, I can't complain.
S Speaker 11:46I get that Absolutely, man, I moved here from LA a couple of months back, so I do complain about the weather sometimes, but I get what you're saying.
I get that Absolutely, man, I moved here from LA a couple of months back, so I do complain about the weather sometimes, but I get what you're saying.

I get that Absolutely, man, I moved here from LA a couple of months back, so I do complain about the weather sometimes, but I get what you're saying.
S Speaker 21:57Yeah, LA is nice. Sometimes it probably gets too hot. Okay, you know what? It's a bit much
Yeah, LA is nice. Sometimes it probably gets too hot. Okay, you know what? It's a bit much

S Speaker 25:15awesome. That's that's so interesting. I mean, it sounds like a lot of investments are pretty broad, but they're still very narrow to like cutting edge technology, like, what is, you know, the most advanced AI, infrastructure technology. So you guys are really on like, the board of leading edge of technology, even though it's a little bit broad, but that's kind of like what I'm getting at here. Yeah,
awesome. That's that's so interesting.

absolutely, structure, the complication, yeah, that's good.
S Speaker 26:15perfect. I can't really see you, so I'm going to,
S Speaker 16:25of like it's sometimes an issue with teams. I know we need to be switching to zoom pretty soon,

S Speaker 26:37but, but yeah, so we're palmye is an AI native code repository for building an alternative to GitHub. So in addition to storing code, we also store valuable metadata that improves the performance of AI coding tools like cursor and copilot.

6:54Are you familiar with like these? Cursor copied their code? Em,
Are you familiar with like these? Cursor copied their code? Em,
Are you familiar with like these? Cursor copied their code? Em,
Are you familiar with like these? Cursor copied their code? Em,
6:57yes, yes. I've taken a broad look at them. Yes,
S Speaker 26:58yeah. Have you or the companies kind of that you've invested in work with these tools in the past?
yeah. Have you or the companies kind of that you've invested in work with these tools in the past?
yeah. Have you or the companies kind of that you've invested in work with these tools in the past?
yeah. Have you or the companies kind of that you've invested in work with these tools in the past?
S Speaker 17:05I don't think so. I don't think any of our companies work with code generation tools right now. Maybe there is an internal I know there's an internal effort right now to sort of evaluate some of these companies from Qualcomm broadly, but I'm not sure what level of traction or where they are right now,

S Speaker 27:22okay, okay, I was wondering, like, maybe, like, you know, developers in the companies you invested in, are they using these kind of opening tools?
okay, okay, I was wondering, like, maybe, like, you know, developers in the companies you invested in, are they using these kind of opening tools?

S Speaker 17:31Not particularly sure, but I assume they might be, yeah,

S Speaker 27:35yeah, but kind of, you kind of familiar with everything, okay, perfect. Yeah. So code repositories were built when AI coding was inconceivable. It was that no one had the idea of, like, you could AI could even code, yeah, that's when the lab time were built. And so now, with these new tools being created, all of a sudden we can have cursor and copilot create large chunks of code and these

S Speaker 28:08they're not doing anything about the conversation history with with the code repositories that is pretty valuable in order to improve and so we as developers, so like myself and my co founder, we work with career services MoBay, and we noticed that, you know, we get extremely frustrated about the output of these code tools because the existing repositories are not doing anything about the data that is valuable, like composition, history And and that's so valuable for the performance of AI police agency. So we are building money a as a new AI native co repository, hosting all of this metadata conversations alongside the boat to really improve the performance of AI agents and AI

S Speaker 29:07so in an IDE, you know, a developer kind of works through the IDE, and kind of works alongside cursor as, kind of like the CO assistant, and kind of like chatgpt, where you're kind of always prompting it, and then it gets you resolved. And then inside cursor, you can automatically apply those changes to your code base directly, so that conversation that you have with cursor is extremely valuable metadata and information that leader, an AI or developer building on top of the code today to get context on kind of what the code, what the intention was behind the fit, and build off of that and provide better results.

S Speaker 19:47Got it and on those conversations, Marcos, do you do any sort of augmentation to store them as metadata, or do you store them as it is?

S Speaker 29:56So we store the conversations as it is, we also kind of summarizes the conversation as well. So we have two sets of data. We have the raw tech summarized version that is exposed directly to developers, but we try and keep all of that kind of the raw conversations to

S Speaker 210:23so this, I mean, so a little bit about us. We graduated both from UC Berkeley with degrees in actual engineering, computer science. I went up to afterwards graduate. I worked at LinkedIn as an infrastructure engineer, and my co founder, Harrison, he went and worked in Microsoft, and he was providing, he was his team enabled large companies like onboard Kubernetes infrastructure on edge. So I remember you, you were saying that was a kind of a big emphasis for Hong Kong on this edge. So, but my co founder did a lot of that work in Microsoft. And so we had a little bit of experience there. And so we as developers kind of went through that pre and post AI boom. And we've noticed the change in how these coding tools kind of changed the lives of developers coding today. And so, you know, when it first came out, it was the novelty of it. We were all super excited, for once, you know, AI can actually but then that kind of, when that novelty, where it off, we started to get extremely frustrated, just about like, the tools that we were using as we're not giving the numbers that we wanted to and and the real and then the problem, like, the reason why it wasn't is because the code repositories it was sitting on didn't host The information that it needed in order to produce the better results, right? So right now, 46% of code is generated by AI, and this is copilot kind of put the statement out. We believe over 80% of code will be generated by AI in the next five years. And the thing that people aren't realizing is that everyone is focusing on the IDE world, trying to make the next ide a software developer, the AI Devin, trying to, like, there's so much competition inside this space, trying to build and create code, and when the actual value comes from the repository, from where the data is actually being stored. Because, you know, AI is all about data, getting as much information as possible. So we believe that the the repository layer and the new repository is the key feature, or the key kind of player in this new world of AI development, and not to mention just in a historically, IDEs and code repositories have been a better business model than IDEs in the past, too, and so we have this strong belief that in the future, IDEs will be used by AIS to work on our behalf and no longer by humans to kind of collaborate.

12:58Yeah, yeah. I do agree to that thesis for sure,
S Speaker 213:06awesome, great. So kind of a little bit about where we are today. We are launching today. We have three committed startups, and that
awesome, great. So kind of a little bit about where we are today. We are launching today. We have three committed startups, and that
awesome, great. So kind of a little bit about where we are today. We are launching today. We have three committed startups, and that
awesome, great. So kind of a little bit about where we are today. We are launching today. We have three committed startups, and that
S Speaker 113:14today is actually today, actually today. Congrats guys. Thank you.
today is actually today, actually today. Congrats guys. Thank you.
today is actually today, actually today. Congrats guys. Thank you.
today is actually today, actually today. Congrats guys. Thank you.
S Speaker 213:21We have three committed users. Our initial product is a VS code extension, and it's really cool, because for the first time in our using our VS code extension, you are able to see the history or the conversation history your coworker has had with their AI in your own repository. So for example, if you know some you know, if I'm working with my co founder, Harrison, and he's working with his AI and his cursor, and he writes some code, now I in my IDE, I can see that history and the conversation that he has had with his AI. And this is so hopeful, because this has never happened before, like I'm now able to get the context of why the code was created, and why the AI produced that code, and I can work on top of it, not to mention there's a lot of productivity gains. I don't have to bother my co founder anymore to see like, Okay, why did you write this anymore? I have this all visual, all this data in front of me that I can read and improve my productivity and also increase the copy that into the My AI tool for my AI to kind of produce that results. Yeah, that's our initial product. That

S Speaker 214:44Yeah, yeah. So, like you said, the end vision goal is to be the center repository to hold all code and metadata. How we get to there, we start off with this VS code extension, and we already start tracking the history and the conversations that developers have with these AIs and and the reason why developers at startups, which is the group kind of we're targeting at right now, is our go to market strategy. And the reason why they would use us as is they already get gains, like productivity, like it's already beneficial to them. As developers, they can now understand the code and what it's doing the intent behind it, and they can copy, paste that into their AI, and their AI will produce better value. So as kind of we progress, we aim to have this metadata natively connect with the AI coding tools, and have palmye and GitHub, for example, just the main competitor, have them run in parallel. Developers do not need to migrate immediately, but they will start to see the benefits of palmier in the results of their AI and just the overall productivity gains. And we're building it so that they can migrate off with zero friction.

S Speaker 216:19Yes, so we still, so we just started fundraising for our RFC round. We're raising 1.5 out of 15 post money save to hit our series any goal of one meaning AR and kind of feature parity with GitHub. So we start that this week, and we would love to have Paul come on board. Oh,

S Speaker 217:24Yeah. So we are looking for investors that have invested kind of in the dev space, the dev tool space before, like the AI area, and kind of knows this area well, and they can provide not only just capital advice, but also that strategic kind of expertise and history in that area as well. So that's kind of like the main kind of talking.
Yeah.

S Speaker 218:07Yeah, we aim to hit our Series A by 24 months. In
S Speaker 118:1124 months, right? And that's interesting. I think we might be a better fit then, but, but I'd love to sort of have an evaluation right now, Marco, would you be able to send me some materials so that I can evaluate internally and have a discussion with the team? I know Tushar was supposed to join in today as well, but he could not, because of a conflict, so we can have a follow up on looping him as well.
24 months, right? And that's interesting.

S Speaker 118:40call, for sure, that would be great Manko and any other questions for me, this sounds pretty interesting, and in case, in case, yeah, I just want to mention that in case, you have a demo of the workflow that would be with some of these startups, or the workflow that your first MVP that you have launched, that you're launching today would enable. That would be a great material for me as well to have in discussion internally. Yeah,
