S Speaker 11:02and we're kind of at a time where they have to seed the courses. So it's a little bit, it's not as green as it always is, but the south should be way better than the North. Is that what they said? Because last time, I think the North was better than the South, and then we were on the south, I know. So now they're saying that the South is going to be better, but they're still seeding it for when the tournaments happen, regardless. So there's going to be some element that doesn't look as pristine as it does when you have the golf tournaments, but, but they said that it would be in like the bus condition would be on the south course. So so it starts at nine o'clock, and we have 40 slots that we did last time, which means that each group of four will start every 10 minutes. So the first group starts at nine, and then every 10 minutes after that won't be the rest of the group, so it'll be 10 groups total, with four people on each team. And what we do is we allow folks like we cover the cost of the folks need to rent golf clubs. We cover that cost. We provide them with box lunches. And the day of they can basically, you know, others like a drink cart that goes around the golf course. They can order whatever they want from the drink card. And basically, I give the master card so they can order whatever they want. They don't have to worry about it, which I think folks appreciate, love it. How many? How many do we How many people do we have? Yeah, right now, and I'll send you. So what I'll do is, I mean, we do have a deadline of, I think the 17th, if we want to reduce the number of groups that we have so the number of spots, I don't think that's gonna happen.
