S Speaker 624:18It's adaptivity, it's flexibility, is embedded awareness in your data. What is our secure company? We call that noise based communication. When people think about noise, they think you add noise to your data and encrypt it and found it and transmit. We don't do that. We actually map data into high dimensional noise center and only transmit that noise, right hand noise image. What does that mean? That means we are actually creating individual language between the receiving and ending and think about the Navajo language even more too. It was not encrypted, but it was a most secure transmission capability for us to win the war we created language by itself between the transmission and seeking, anytime you do transmission, you get a new language. That's why it's so secure. Our government is really interested in this technology without a team of industry expertise.

S Speaker 932:11I'm here to introduce you to flock X, AI collaboration, a agent collaboration, and really about initiating the exponential power of connected intelligence. So start with just a little bit about flock decks, our co founder, shumai and Sheik. He was the first investor in DeepMind, so he's kind of an OG in what all generative AI is now, and he hand selected this team to work on a problem that is new and unexpected. So we'll start with the idea that f actually finished things. And I have a quote up here that's, you know, it's a paraphrase, but it's mostly attributed to Darwin. Most people don't finish the book. They stop at survival of the fittest as the key to evolution. But that is not the key to evolution. It was not Darwin's findings. It was that in the long history of humankind and animal kind that those who learned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed, and So collaboration is the key to higher order intelligence and higher order outcomes. So we're seeing right now that the full potential of the aging economy is stalling a bit because of the disparate marketplaces, disparate silos that agents can communicate and collaborate in. So you have your Lang chains and your crew AI, and they seem to operate Okay, collaborating internally, which is really message passing, but as we get to a higher order of collaboration that requires just a significant more thought and unexpected issues that you find as you go through that process. So this coordination across these district tools is requiring new protocols and new discovery identification and capabilities and reputation. So collaboration equals compound value. So what's our solution? Our solution is to, is to deploy the new collaboration layer that connects your agent to all the AI agent marketplaces and any agent to agent interaction. And we can do that in over the open web and easy as a button click. Think of it as Shopify for agents, both the building code building of agents, but also establishing those standardized patterns of communication. That's ultimately what Shopify solved was standardized e commerce patterns, so that a small business didn't have to know the details of conversion strategies in order to deploy a product, conduct sales and have mobile, online sales, easy, easy, easy, for small and medium sized businesses and larger businesses that they've grown into.

S Speaker 934:55Coco is a top Austin food influencer. She's got a long history of operation and getting subscriptions to her blog and her notion that allow kind of her subscribers to determine what are the current trending spots, what are the hottest food locations? She's been a leading tech innovator in that influencer space, and has had agents operating for her answering questions for her subscribers, and she ran into some problems over that period. Was working great for just a single communication with her customer, but as she needed to improve her productivity, she needed agents that could go out and do research, talk to other small businesses in the area that have agents that then can be coordinated with. And this became a significant problem for her so and then she also couldn't get connected to things like, how does she get surfaced inside chat, GBT, or any of these other What are becoming called meta ais that aren't the direct agent, but they're the access to the agent through a text based interaction. So once Coco connected into the flock exito system, it allowed her to deploy a series of her agents that then could collaborate amongst themselves, but also then collaborate with agents that were not under her control. So this is a significant productivity increase for her. So one of the things she does is she needs to evaluate all those businesses, primarily eateries, restaurants and concert experiences in the Austin area. And so she's acknowledging what's going on to that research, bringing back that curated content, and then the clock X collaboration layer allows each of those agents to generate like book tables, discover what the newest trending spots are that match the consumers preference graph? Not just here's recommendations from the cool kids, but how does it match up to your personal preference graph? I don't eat seafood. I love hot wings, I love live music at every place that I want to go and hang out. To map those preference graph against the kind of the identity of the facilities, and then also have the curated kind of quality score from Coco. So during these interactions, she's able to achieve this, you know, go out and, you know, plan an entire week premier plan a plan A night out. Got a surprise birthday party that we're working on here. And the agents collaborate back and forth, using the preferences of each and individuals to ensure that everyone who joins that event has the highest quality outcome. So this stuff we can go through pretty quickly. We imagine that every single business has a website, we'll have an agent, and so that kind of develops this larger market picture, our traction. We've got ideal customer personas looking at tech savvy companies. We're kind of leading the edge saying people have websites first, the interoperability of agents is really the value proposition. It's both from a productivity perspective, but then also from delivering on a higher level of strategy in your given organization, by being able to consult and collaborate with agents out in the world. We currently are mining most of our collaboration deals through a very first agent marketplace that was out there called agenters. And so now we've currently got an agent 80% conversion rate, which seems absolutely crazy, but that's because we are extremely curated and targeted to people who are already having the problem where collaboration has become difficult and significant in their ability to move forward with their agent architecture. So this is our kind of growth goals, kind of thing. It's not as important right now revenue model. We're starting with a SaaS based model. We will have more complex monetization strategies in the future, but this is the simplest to understand and for our customers and the easiest to get them to buy into. So and I can just real quick go through the team. So we've got human shape. That's a known quantity. Devin, our CEO, Dev and I have worked together for 15 years, and we built our team out of the highest performing talent of our entire careers. So that's why we're highly focused on flock X. We just went recruited everybody who was awesome throughout our entire career. We believe that's why we'll win. Thank you.
Coco is a top Austin food influencer. She's got a long history of operation and getting subscriptions to her blog and her notion that allow kind of her subscribers to determine what are the current trending spots, what are the hottest food locations? She's been a leading tech innovator in that influencer space, and has had agents operating for her answering questions for her subscribers, and she ran into some problems over that period. Was working great for just a single communication with her customer, but as she needed to improve her productivity, she needed agents that could go out and do research, talk to other small businesses in the area that have agents that then can be coordinated with. And this became a significant problem for her so and then she also couldn't get connected to things like, how does she get surfaced inside chat, GBT, or any of these other What are becoming called meta ais that aren't the direct agent, but they're the access to the agent through a text based interaction. So once Coco connected into the flock exito system, it allowed her to deploy a series of her agents that then could collaborate amongst themselves, but also then collaborate with agents that were not under her control. So this is a significant productivity increase for her. So one of the things she does is she needs to evaluate all those businesses, primarily eateries, restaurants and concert experiences in the Austin area. And so she's acknowledging what's going on to that research, bringing back that curated content, and then the clock X collaboration layer allows each of those agents to generate like book tables, discover what the newest trending spots are that match the consumers preference graph? Not just here's recommendations from the cool kids, but how does it match up to your personal preference graph? I don't eat seafood. I love hot wings, I love live music at every place that I want to go and hang out. To map those preference graph against the kind of the identity of the facilities, and then also have the curated kind of quality score from Coco. So during these interactions, she's able to achieve this, you know, go out and, you know, plan an entire week premier plan a plan A night out. Got a surprise birthday party that we're working on here. And the agents collaborate back and forth, using the preferences of each and individuals to ensure that everyone who joins that event has the highest quality outcome. So this stuff we can go through pretty quickly. We imagine that every single business has a website, we'll have an agent, and so that kind of develops this larger market picture, our traction. We've got ideal customer personas looking at tech savvy companies. We're kind of leading the edge saying people have websites first, the interoperability of agents is really the value proposition. It's both from a productivity perspective, but then also from delivering on a higher level of strategy in your given organization, by being able to consult and collaborate with agents out in the world. We currently are mining most of our collaboration deals through a very first agent marketplace that was out there called agenters. And so now we've currently got an agent 80% conversion rate, which seems absolutely crazy, but that's because we are extremely curated and targeted to people who are already having the problem where collaboration has become difficult and significant in their ability to move forward with their agent architecture. So this is our kind of growth goals, kind of thing. It's not as important right now revenue model. We're starting with a SaaS based model. We will have more complex monetization strategies in the future, but this is the simplest to understand and for our customers and the easiest to get them to buy into.

S Speaker 1039:57The goal is to learn to improve the productivity of safety teams and ultimately, to reduce musculoskeletal musculoskeletal injuries are actually the number one cause of injury in the United States. In fact, OSHA would tell you that the indirect costs, which is $18 billion a year, could be up to four times that amount on indirect costs. The good news is there's lots of academic research that says utilizing ergonomic assessments within within a organization dramatically reduces the injury up to 65% in this study, the fact that the return on investment is for every dollar invested in safety yields a three to $6 return. We're focused on the industrial market. So industrial hospitals, why? That's where we see competitive injuries, and that's what turning 66 million employees, and this, we believe the total revenue opportunity here is a billion dollars. We've been in business for about four years, but it's really taken off in the last three months as we've added additional tools on top. We've got 250,000 closed sales, but we are very close to 1.3 million in visible pipeline here we've got customers like liberty, mutual, Pfizer, one at achieving Coronavirus. These customers are, on average, paying us up here to $25,000 annually. We've got new customers, including Ford and Google. The advantage is we've spent a lot of time on the underlying technology, and we now have our customers that are showing us to other their competitors, right? By example, Pfizer has recently shown us to GSK, Merck, Ford has actually brought us into GM. It's the honest. So we've got a lot of interesting things going for us. We also have partnerships that we've developed with larger EHS companies. Specifically, we publicly announced 40 they are bringing us companies like the VA, Intel, Apple, too early to add those to pipeline, but those are the type of customers they're bringing us. The advantage of that is that we've already had floated takeout opportunity by one of these, so we're de risking the exit strategy by partnering. We have four patents, public continuation patents. Again, it's a SaaS business model. Again, we're focused on direct to those industrial customers, hospitals, but through also doing indirect through partnerships, our biggest competitor is actually status quo. People are using pen and paper and Excel spreadsheets to do this. It's very time consuming and very subjective. So what our technology does is dramatically improve the productivity of the safety professional and its objective data our two other competitors to mecky and philosophy, I would say 50% of our customers are actually coming from our competitors. The reason for that is simply more accurate data math that comes in. We have our own motion capture facility to build our own proprietary models and annotated data sets, and that's that's been the competitive note for us.

S Speaker 1245:22be awesome. All right, I'm the CEO and founder of money. You can think of us as the stopify for solar, storage and charging businesses. My backup started 10 years ago at Tesla, when it was Solar City. My co founder Jonathan skilled one of the largest privately held solar companies. It's about a billion a year, called Momentum solar, and our CTO was a researcher at the University of Waterloo in Toronto, and did work for the Canadian Space Agency as well. The three of us worked together at our last company called Colossus, which we exited about three and a half years ago. Little bit about our traction. We launched 28 months ago. These are some of our investors, FJ labs, Ludlow, Logan play and in 2022 we did the 100k in revenue. 2023 about 10,000,024 2421 and the plan is to do 55 million of that, 2024 number, 3 million of that is actually subscriptions. Majority of these are transactions that are reoccurring in nature, which I'll get into. This should be no surprise to any of you. We're seeing the largest energy demand right now since World War Two, due to AI onshoring crypto and Ed. We've got to do something about it. There's a place for nuclear. There's a place for natural gas. Solar, however, is the fastest and lowest cost way to meet this demand. Consumer that actually install it on their home and get batteries in their garage are actually happy lower their energy bill gives them energy security to that one of blackouts and freedom from their utility companies. So what's the issue? The installers, the boots on the ground, are actually struggling to meet this demand. Soft costs are the highest they've ever been, which is representation of how grossly underserved they've been with technology and software. To give you a flavor for this, it takes six people, four pieces of software and two weeks just to give the consumer a price on the scope of work. And 60% of the time it's still inaccurate, and half the time the customer decides to cancel because of this experience introduced modally, we created artists which is 400 times sorry, 600 times faster, four times more accurate, and it's a fifth of the cost of this traditional status quo experience the way it works, three lines of code embeds on a customer's website and completely transforms their buying experience. They give it as like a digital POS, takes it from two weeks down to a minute, and it's as simple to install as a you know, as you as you would strike so it. This is finally possible due to the intersection of transformers, computer vision and geospatial technologies, we can now take aerial imagery and through enough training in the right data, enhance it 900 fold through super resolution Gan and diffusion models, and then do things that are usually done in person with on site digits, like edge detection, object detection, build a 3d model of the home calculate the roof pitch and the azimuth, and then solar radiance, which is how much sunlight is hitting that roof every second of every day for 25 years, which is what lenders need to underwrite these projects. Then account for local regulations and fire setbacks, place the panels on their roof for optimal placement, and do all of this in 14 seconds, because that's what consumers expect. The data to make this possible has been a bit of the hardest unlock for us. We have 100 terabytes of data that's taken about nine years to collect through the partnerships that we've put in place, along with us getting licensed across 6000 jurisdictions in order to get the electrical building code, fire codes that are required to model out these systems accurately and automatically we've now so we think of that as what was built our pricing engine or our wedge. We've now only started introducing embedded financing, and the key in how we've set up our platform is Artemis is set up as the installer of record. That's important so we can get all the energy data, and we can track what was modeled, is that actually what was permitted, is that what was installed and underwritten. And so today, we're collecting every second the exact kilowatt hours of the systems that have installed, so that each incremental new project is more accurate. This year alone compared to last year. We're 20% more accurate. And so each each consumer rates installer benefits on the other side, as the installer of record allows us to aggregate the volume of all these projects and negotiate collectively for better equipment pricing, better financing, and thereby the installers can choose to take that as more margin or better savings to their consumers. And these set up this way allows us to also capture revenue two different ways. We get subscriptions from these installers, and then we get transaction fees for each project that is underrated in the form of origination fees and transaction fees. The market is quite large. There's actually 45,000 installers across North America and Europe serving 5% of those 2400 installers is 100 million ARR business, along with a billion a year in annual transaction revenue. A bit of a spotlight from one of our customers, good leaf.com they took their sales process from seven days to a minute, and now unlocked a lot of transfer sales process. This means in revenue, took them 30 days, typically to generate 420,000 took them two days to generate half a million dollars, part of this, and doing all of this while in reducing the cost to their consumers by 35%
be awesome. All right, I'm the CEO and founder of money. You can think of us as the stopify for solar, storage and charging businesses.

It's about a billion a year, called Momentum solar, and our CTO was a researcher at the University of Waterloo in Toronto, and did work for the Canadian Space Agency as well. The three of us worked together at our last company called Colossus, which we exited about three and a half years ago. Little bit about our traction. We launched 28 months ago. These are some of our investors, FJ labs, Ludlow, Logan play and in 2022 we did the 100k in revenue. 2023 about 10,000,024 2421 and the plan is to do 55 million of that, 2024 number, 3 million of that is actually subscriptions. Majority of these are transactions that are reoccurring in nature, which I'll get into. This should be no surprise to any of you. We're seeing the largest energy demand right now since World War Two, due to AI onshoring crypto and Ed. We've got to do something about it. There's a place for nuclear. There's a place for natural gas. Solar, however, is the fastest and lowest cost way to meet this demand. Consumer that actually install it on their home and get batteries in their garage are actually happy lower their energy bill gives them energy security to that one of blackouts and freedom from their utility companies. So what's the issue? The installers, the boots on the ground, are actually struggling to meet this demand. Soft costs are the highest they've ever been, which is representation of how grossly underserved they've been with technology and software. To give you a flavor for this, it takes six people, four pieces of software and two weeks just to give the consumer a price on the scope of work. And 60% of the time it's still inaccurate, and half the time the customer decides to cancel because of this experience introduced modally, we created artists which is 400 times sorry, 600 times faster, four times more accurate, and it's a fifth of the cost of this traditional status quo experience the way it works, three lines of code embeds on a customer's website and completely transforms their buying experience. They give it as like a digital POS, takes it from two weeks down to a minute, and it's as simple to install as a you know, as you as you would strike so it. This is finally possible due to the intersection of transformers, computer vision and geospatial technologies, we can now take aerial imagery and through enough training in the right data, enhance it 900 fold through super resolution Gan and diffusion models, and then do things that are usually done in person with on site digits, like edge detection, object detection, build a 3d model of the home calculate the roof pitch and the azimuth, and then solar radiance, which is how much sunlight is hitting that roof every second of every day for 25 years, which is what lenders need to underwrite these projects. Then account for local regulations and fire setbacks, place the panels on their roof for optimal placement, and do all of this in 14 seconds, because that's what consumers expect. The data to make this possible has been a bit of the hardest unlock for us. We have 100 terabytes of data that's taken about nine years to collect through the partnerships that we've put in place, along with us getting licensed across 6000 jurisdictions in order to get the electrical building code, fire codes that are required to model out these systems accurately and automatically we've now so we think of that as what was built our pricing engine or our wedge. We've now only started introducing embedded financing, and the key in how we've set up our platform is Artemis is set up as the installer of record. That's important so we can get all the energy data, and we can track what was modeled, is that actually what was permitted, is that what was installed and underwritten. And so today, we're collecting every second the exact kilowatt hours of the systems that have installed, so that each incremental new project is more accurate. This year alone compared to last year. We're 20% more accurate. And so each each consumer rates installer benefits on the other side, as the installer of record allows us to aggregate the volume of all these projects and negotiate collectively for better equipment pricing, better financing, and thereby the installers can choose to take that as more margin or better savings to their consumers. And these set up this way allows us to also capture revenue two different ways. We get subscriptions from these installers, and then we get transaction fees for each project that is underrated in the form of origination fees and transaction fees. The market is quite large. There's actually 45,000 installers across North America and Europe serving 5% of those 2400 installers is 100 million ARR business, along with a billion a year in annual transaction revenue. A bit of a spotlight from one of our customers, good leaf.com they took their sales process from seven days to a minute, and now unlocked a lot of transfer sales process. This means in revenue, took them 30 days, typically to generate 420,000 took them two days to generate half a million dollars, part of this, and doing all of this while in reducing the cost to their consumers by 35%

S Speaker 141:00:41for the final presentation of this, of this set. Let's close with higher energy. I mean, what an excitement. What an exciting thing. You know, I was reading about touring to talk about AI and software. So my name is Iva parachas, and I'm the CEO, co founder of mood test. We are the cursor of software testing. Software Testing is a pain. It's a pain. It has always been a pain because it's difficult. It's a slow if companies want to do it, they need to hire manual testers that last days or weeks testing the software. If the companies want to automate the testing, they need to hire developers to create scripts for years, causing a lot of money for a long time, for a long time, basically, they end up having to suffer sober teams, one for testing, one for software development. And if the companies don't do it, customers find defects, cross drive American Airlines, and they lost a lot, a lot of revenue. That's what we created, boot test, which is an authentic AI solution that has different agents that automate the whole software testing process, optimizing for feedback. So we have a lot of agents that test the software and give feedback on the quality of the software. We are not creating just a tool. We are not creating those tests. We have agents that go ahead test the software and give feedback on the quality as soon as possible, so the development team can fix the issues right away. And I will show you, this is a customer. They are a public company, talent Inc for working with us. They were that they were they had 10 QAs doing manual testing for two weeks. So it was a long sales, a long cycle to go to production. After five months, we had 3000 test cases, automated that were running in less than 30 minutes. So this effort, if they wanted to do it with on in house developers, would have taken two or three years at the end, they have an ROI, hard ROI of $1.5 million because they decided to lead the to let the QA team go up. That was not their choice. And also, they were saving 7 million of dollars of defects that were being caught before production. Before that, they were having a lot of defects that were escaping the market is huge. I want to stop. I won't do too much here, but at the end, everyone needs to solve to test their software. So it's from the high billions to trillions and more. Now with ai, ai is generating crappy code, crap applications, so there is some room for more user and testing. But practically, we have grown from zero to 1.6 million ARR in two years after we deposited the last time, and we are in. We have been the pipeline enough to get to 2 million ARR this quarter. Regarding competition, our most spotted competitor is called QA world, and we are treating them for Team Three in deals that we have stolen from there, even worse than the Super Bowl. And the fact is that our technology can automate and test 7x faster than them, at least customers we sell to SMBs and mid markets, CPOs, VP of Engineering, and the ICP goes from 50k to 150 K, and we can expand more and more as we want to enterprise. The team I have been doing QA for 21 years. That's one of the main things of us, that we have a high quality mindset. Most of the new companies in the space, they are being developed by developers. The rule number one in testing is developers shouldn't test their own software because they don't want to kill their baby. So we have a strong team with me, 21 years of experience. My co founder, Renan, is an expert in machine learning, and now we have a team of five researchers, peer PhDs and machine learning engineers, improving our models to test also. Now we have a sales team. Last year, we added two account executives, and three weeks ago, we found a ninja VP of sales, and we hired him. So the go to market team is almost ready with this round. We want to hire the marketing team talking about the round, we are raising three millions into round to take us to 10 million Arr, with two years at regular velocity. But we we strongly believe that with the new business models that have been discovered by lovable pursuit or bold we can take advantage of those business models. And this can be three, 4x

But we we strongly believe that with the new business models that have been discovered by lovable pursuit or bold we can take advantage of those business models. And this can be three, 4x
for the final presentation of this, of this set. Let's close with higher energy. I mean, what an excitement. What an exciting thing. You know, I was reading about touring to talk about AI and software. So my name is Iva parachas, and I'm the CEO, co founder of mood test. We are the cursor of software testing. Software Testing is a pain. It's a pain. It has always been a pain because it's difficult. It's a slow if companies want to do it, they need to hire manual testers that last days or weeks testing the software. If the companies want to automate the testing, they need to hire developers to create scripts for years, causing a lot of money for a long time, for a long time, basically, they end up having to suffer sober teams, one for testing, one for software development. And if the companies don't do it, customers find defects, cross drive American Airlines, and they lost a lot, a lot of revenue. That's what we created, boot test, which is an authentic AI solution that has different agents that automate the whole software testing process, optimizing for feedback. So we have a lot of agents that test the software and give feedback on the quality of the software. We are not creating just a tool. We are not creating those tests. We have agents that go ahead test the software and give feedback on the quality as soon as possible, so the development team can fix the issues right away. And I will show you, this is a customer. They are a public company, talent Inc for working with us. They were that they were they had 10 QAs doing manual testing for two weeks. So it was a long sales, a long cycle to go to production. After five months, we had 3000 test cases, automated that were running in less than 30 minutes. So this effort, if they wanted to do it with on in house developers, would have taken two or three years at the end, they have an ROI, hard ROI of $1.5 million because they decided to lead the to let the QA team go up. That was not their choice. And also, they were saving 7 million of dollars of defects that were being caught before production. Before that, they were having a lot of defects that were escaping the market is huge. I want to stop. I won't do too much here, but at the end, everyone needs to solve to test their software. So it's from the high billions to trillions and more. Now with ai, ai is generating crappy code, crap applications, so there is some room for more user and testing. But practically, we have grown from zero to 1.6 million ARR in two years after we deposited the last time, and we are in. We have been the pipeline enough to get to 2 million ARR this quarter. Regarding competition, our most spotted competitor is called QA world, and we are treating them for Team Three in deals that we have stolen from there, even worse than the Super Bowl. And the fact is that our technology can automate and test 7x faster than them, at least customers we sell to SMBs and mid markets, CPOs, VP of Engineering, and the ICP goes from 50k to 150 K, and we can expand more and more as we want to enterprise. The team I have been doing QA for 21 years. That's one of the main things of us, that we have a high quality mindset. Most of the new companies in the space, they are being developed by developers. The rule number one in testing is developers shouldn't test their own software because they don't want to kill their baby. So we have a strong team with me, 21 years of experience. My co founder, Renan, is an expert in machine learning, and now we have a team of five researchers, peer PhDs and machine learning engineers, improving our models to test also.

S Speaker 141:06:11Okay, okay, let's talk through the demo so they were before AI so that the teams, if they wanted to automate cryptos and test cases. They needed at least 50 month hours in traditional open source selenium and playwright the world with MOOC. Now anyone can test completely everything. They can just add the text, and the agents will suggest these cases and automate it. They will suggest these cases that's important, not just auto mail and also they

S Speaker 141:06:45they come just by putting the URL and credentials, the agents will go ahead and test the software and give feedback. Now for designers or for product managers in JIRA used by creating a user story, the agents will understand the English and the sign test cases and provide the results. Now from figma for for designers the same as soon as there is something that can be tested, the agents will go ahead explore, roll the software and the sign test cases and test right away. And finally, from eat COVID as well as as far as there is a pull request, the agents will go ahead and test the new changes, finding any regression defects and just to finalize, also from any 80 IDE, like pursuit or any IDE, the agents, as soon as the code is ready, they will take that input, Go ahead and test the software and retrieve feedback. So in short, we can test anything everywhere, all the time. Thank you. Reach out to you need any questions?
