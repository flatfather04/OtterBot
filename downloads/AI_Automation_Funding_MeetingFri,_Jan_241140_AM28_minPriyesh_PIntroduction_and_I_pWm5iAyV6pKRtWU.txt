S Speaker 21:44wow, that's that's a wide gamut of opportunities that's amazing. What year did you graduate? Just last year? So 2024, so I've been with Qualcomm and just for a year, about close to a year now work here as a senior associate, and maybe I can give you a background about the fund as well. So I work here as a senior associate. I work with our Managing Director, Tushar and both of us, we lead our investment. Ai investment vertical. Other than that, the fund also looks at, I would say, robotics, IoT, industrial automation, automobile tech stack, AR VR, sometimes SaaS, sometimes semiconductor silicon companies. So, broadly speaking, quite a lot of areas. If you see anything which has a degree of connect with Compute or connectivity, that's where I think we play. We are a seed plus funds. So our check sizes are typically two to ten million sweet spot would be somewhere between five to seven. That's that's how we sort of look at it. Typically aim to deploy about $150 million a year in US geography. But we are a global fund. So we have offices in India, Israel, China, UK, Latin America. So quite a wide gamut of team. A lot of us are here in Bay Area. Some of us are in San Diego as well. And then, mostly about it, is there something that I missed? Do you have any pointed questions for me? It

S Speaker 13:21was fine. You mentioned connectivity and that when the Tiana tell me list of investors who want to connect, I picked up your name because recently we started to work with like we started now big pilot with Shimizu construction company, and it looks like over time, we will connect our agentic automation layer to sensors of different kind, like dust, water, seismic, video cameras like that. I explained why we do that, but that's probably where hardware meets software, and that could be just an angle, though. I think I'm not ready for the seed round yet. So I first wanted this mail, and I recently raised just 700k like, four months ago, yeah, and just, just brought to the market and got the first lines. I don't think I'm in the seed territory yet, and also, I'm not raising the quantity of money, but let me introduce myself, and maybe we can, you know, let's see if it will be interesting any conversation now, or maybe we can connect later in a year, once I will be raising

S Speaker 19:05work across many systems, and building workflows across many systems is something time consuming. There is automation, cost of that, and also this process is variable. It's like they're, yes, they are, in general, similar processes, but they still variable to certain degree and require customization. So you cannot sell this as a SaaS solution that just does that, and because of that, only in sales category, performance management integrity actually exists in other industries. It does not, with one exception, IT security compliance. I really like tools like Banta or dreaded that. I like my first SOC cost it like 100 something K, and now it costs like 1k months, because I have a platform with controls, therefore and so on, and I can see how my employees follow different rules and can fix it. I want to give their experience to other industries. Agents are capable to make them keep will be hired. Very good co founder from DocuSign, who is notable, AI leader. There was leader and now,

S Speaker 110:40focus on construction. Sorry, is it like overall? But it's good industry. Healthcare is good industry as well. They're compliance course for nurses, for doctors, for physicians, for pharmacists, that even exist on the board level of organizations. So yes, but the problem is process compliance, process monitoring and task creation to address issues.

S Speaker 111:22Yeah, let me show you a few things here. So let's look at three cases like his workflow examples, yeah, waste management. Let's say so you're general contractor. You don't build you hire other companies to build different parts and connect the dots. So let's say you notice in your project management system that too much of your waste goes to landfill, and by lead, you should not send that much. So you create an alerting data for the site manager immediately. You schedule the review by waste sorting. You create the action plan for the sustainability coordinator, because now they need to offset this on some other of their activities. You schedule follow up inspection to see new things happened. And once everything above seems to be fixed, you do the final verification in the systems. So you do any bi polls and collect the data into, let's say, teleport things like that, where you compare it against the rules.

S Speaker 112:44So for instance, that, my example, you like, you don't want non personalized follow ups. You toggle this too, and you start to see on a dashboard how many deals have been reviewed, but how them have been found missing personalized follow ups. And also, you want drive engagement, showing people what deals in the post pipeline they should engage. You want to minimize number of deals that went dark and see there in stages that not supposed to be dark. Your playbook has tower curves. Kind of user said, like, I want not to give any promises that Canada will feel so you want it or communications like email or slack or promises, essentially take sales playbook and turn it reverse, looking for these behaviors that you want to to achieve there and just look at the model and does the product itself. You see the back end essentially connects View API to different tools, but that's where you can see how agents and

S Speaker 113:56goals. Again, easy to understand some of these tests. They just quite view them because we get this to problem have mostly like these factory they can start to produce cases here in the back end. And this is very easy case to understand. So you do have sort of CDs, and you do have position description. You want this matching to be done, not only the words based, but on a logical basis for that, typically, you hire someone to do or you do it yourself. Even more often, you do it yourself, because HR cannot do it. They are not SMR. In the topic that you are SMR, and that will be a software engineers, but resumes will be not for a software engineers to be all resonance, only developer resonance. You'll be looking at them. And then, instead of having a workflow, here, it's chain of tasks on fairly high level, like we open our own description and requirements, select ends with AI experience, or you see these match them. Add more tasks here, like send an email. But this goes from API to API, so just intermediate, and we can, like, run it. When that happens, this work is greater engine and starts to slice and dial this work according to tasks to other agents to come to the final result. And then pretty much, you get the explanation of why someone like stop candidate for interview. This explanation seems to be fairly advanced, because here we use different tricks around increasing computing power and models where we don't feel we have good results and so on. We also have like restrictions with you, with info, essentially that was all created by my CTO of the improved performance and consistency of this small task execution, but process compliance monitoring and improvement pretty much means making API calls comparing the data you receive against certain rules, guidelines data, and then making one or two more API calls like create task aside, check the status of task and so on. And we currently integrate with ton of product management software. That's where we started. But CRMs are coming support systems, I think already there, like as part of the ticketing and yeah, now CRMs and HubSpot are the most kind of wanted features by your pipeline. Yeah.
goals. Again, easy to understand some of these tests. They just quite view them because we get this to problem have mostly like these factory they can start to produce cases here in the back end. And this is very easy case to understand. So you do have sort of CDs, and you do have position description. You want this matching to be done, not only the words based, but on a logical basis for that, typically, you hire someone to do or you do it yourself. Even more often, you do it yourself, because HR cannot do it. They are not SMR. In the topic that you are SMR, and that will be a software engineers, but resumes will be not for a software engineers to be all resonance, only developer resonance. You'll be looking at them. And then, instead of having a workflow, here, it's chain of tasks on fairly high level, like we open our own description and requirements, select ends with AI experience, or you see these match them. Add more tasks here, like send an email. But this goes from API to API, so just intermediate, and we can, like, run it. When that happens, this work is greater engine and starts to slice and dial this work according to tasks to other agents to come to the final result.

S Speaker 117:00So curious, multi agent framework, but yeah, you can kind of build agents for that, but it's more more than agent. It's framework. So we do have own framework, and we use own agents, but the same time, we will allow external agents to be part of this as well. It just makes sense to implement them. And we actually have interesting use case of benchmarking other agents performance on synthetic data, because we need that to build our own system. And we thought like, why wouldn't we let other like clients want to understand who is the best marketing agent, to try the same evaluation process we use for agent benchmarking than they do so in a couple of weeks, probably will release this publicly with Michael del fund as sponsor of synthetic data, essentially, that will be fun. Like in the past, there was Olympic Games for RP bots that the first word the completion of developers, turned on the competition of vendors, and it was so much fun to compete, and we hold the title of like winner for six months, and bragged a lot about that.

It's not your exceeded that. It's your contractor exceeded that. So you schedule again for site manager, for subcontractor, lead, EHS, manager, maintenance supervisor, legal compliance department, and so on. And it all started this sense,

S Speaker 122:50Can be but it probably brings us to the topic of like, third party agent integration. So how important it is for you. Like, to me, it's important to own the UX that clients use and have thin enough layer so thick enough layer under the UX to add value. And currently, there is a lot coming from being able to orchestrate how these agents exchange data and so on over time, that probably will be less important. So we need to be able to incorporate the best, essentially reasoning, computing capabilities into this but by that time, the solution will emerge as something that is essentially interfacing with people.

S Speaker 223:34I get your point. Dementri, it makes a lot of sense to sort of try to own the UX layer. How are you thinking about competitive positioning in the market? You will see a lot of vertical, specific off the shelf, agents, or agent tech systems, which will do some of the tasks that your system could do as well. You would see some horizontal platform, like crew, crew, AI, tool house, things like that, which could compete. So how are you planning to position yourself and what on what factors do you think you can win, just focusing

S Speaker 124:04on the business problem that businesses have. So if you look at how crew is being used in enterprises, being used by IT teams to build to experiment, they're not solving real business problems where they start solving the pains coming out, and they start to look for products and platforms. And products and platforms are great, but I don't see much competition currently in the production for my GTM channel, specifically, very important to be the best in some class of problem you try to address. It's much easier to be the best in like aI automation tool or AI automation framework. Some companies will be, of course, building. But if you go to Reddit, for instance, and read about crew or one chain, there will be very big number of people who say, like, it's my guy so complex, like, I don't understand how it works. And these are developers, yeah, and I want to be friendly to business users.

If we, let's say, sign up two more clients or three more clients, you likely will increase the relation to 15.
