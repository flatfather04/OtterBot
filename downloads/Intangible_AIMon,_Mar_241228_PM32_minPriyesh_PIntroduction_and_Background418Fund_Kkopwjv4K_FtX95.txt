S Speaker 14:21hi, Bharat. How are you I'm good. Thank you. How are you doing? I'm doing pretty good. Thanks a lot for the flexibility and we the flexibility. And we have to change the meeting a couple of things. I'm glad you got to connect with but it's been a crazy four or five days, but I'm excited to talk to you again. I feel like I want to say Qualcomm was an investor in August. I think you have 190% 90% sure you guys were an investment. Which one, which one? August home. It was a smartphone company, Smart Access. Nice to bump up against a fund that has, you know, I've returned capital to so it always feels better when you actually return money to them, absolutely, hey, listen, I thought we invested

S Speaker 25:02in your last thing. Whatever happened? Yeah, that's a point I can bring back to Athena, for sure, but you're good. Well, that's that's great, but then I definitely got to see the pitch during the demo day, so that was really good. So I do have an overview of the company. Maybe I can give you a brief background about the fund.

S Speaker 15:19I'm sure you know some things about us, but maybe things have changed. It changes a lot, right? So I'm old at this point, so I've seen a few generations of partners cycle through the fund. So our person's not even at Qualcomm

S Speaker 16:56No, I mean, to this, I don't know if this is on the, you know, the band reason program, as you know, is mostly for seed or, you know, large seeds, but not as because that's what they play as well. How do

S Speaker 27:06you think? How does this fit within that charter? It does fit because I really and in fact, it was a question from my end as well. I saw a post where it seems like you have already raised around. So is that true? Are you still planning to raise but typically, for a seed round, we would go anywhere from a smaller check size perspective, to a small check of 1.5 million, and

S Speaker 17:28then follow up with a larger checkpoint rounds. Yeah, that's fair. We raised 4 million last year from and recent cross link both firms that I've known for a long time, I think you guys might also have invest across. You probably invest through both of them at this point, since both funds have been around for a while. Yeah, we're raising. We set out to raise another couple of million dollars for our balance sheet. We still have 2.5 off the 4.2 we raised originally. Yeah, we have not spent most of it, but given the traction we've seen, we want to make sure we're not fundraising in July and August. If things start, just take off. So our thinking is, let's put a couple million dollars more on the balance sheet. It'll probably be the last one. Is it 20 posts July of last year. And so my guess is this, and recent costing will probably want this to be at a 3035, cap, call it, and gives it enough headroom for the low end of an A if we end up doing one next year, or, you know, we get to close to $100 million in valuation, then high end of an A as well. So that's what, that's how we're thinking about it. There's a small 10% chance that one of our insiders just leads around and doesn't do an A, but does a $5 million check size and calls it to seed and takes takes the company off the

S Speaker 18:52considering strategics at the point? At the moment, we are, I think, you know, we have two financial investors in the cap table. And so whether it's you guys podcast ventures turn in wonder co like, you know, we look at companies and go, is there a fit? Do they like us? Do we like what value could they add? And so I think that's kind of how we're thinking about the capital raise demo day went really, really well, so I reasonably confident we'll get to the $2 million and it's just a matter of round.

S Speaker 29:23Construction should become clear by the end of this week, understood from a strategy point of view, I think freedom space, we are very actively looking at, we're talking to a couple of other I would say, text to Video, Video generation models, feature generation models, companies. And then we feel, given that our platform across mobile devices and PCs, we are launching a lot of npus. We can enable some of these natively on those companies, and then, and like, probably ship the solution along with an OEM. So that's like the GTM and engineering partnership.

S Speaker 19:58We feel we can add strategic value to, okay, very cool, interesting. I mean, everything we do is very, you know, web oriented. So everything you're seeing here is, you know, being one in a browser, and it's built for customers that you probably have, you know, in the film, games, advertising, kind of space, event space, that we would have a lot of.

S Speaker 110:33you're gearing towards the public launch, that's fine. I would say, you know, we have validated the product with design partners for the past 90 days. We have a huge pipeline of people waiting to be let in, and we're in closed beta right now, so we keep letting more and more and more people in to work out the bugs, to try and put in payments, all the stuff we need to do. And then in June, we'll update the floodgates. So that's roughly the schedule you see over here, which is closed beta. In March, June, we have paid launch self serve. And then June to December is really fulfilling the demand that's sitting in our pipeline. But our pricing model is pretty simple, 15 bucks a month for individuals, 40 bucks a month for professionals, plus some credit system

S Speaker 211:17more image and video generation. I'd love to know a little bit more about the architecture you're using behind the entire platform? Is there any proprietary data set that you have used in terms of who are these design partners? And at the end, I'm asking a lot of questions, but at the end the GDM and are you actually targeting individual developers? Are you targeting enterprises?

S Speaker 117:41the ease of use of self serve and a plg motion that's pushing it bottoms up into the organizations, and building a tool that can spread by itself and sort of has extensive legal mind users, and then separately, AWS, or like a Tatari, or like any of these ad networks, they also want to start providing it for free, because they're trying to generate ads on their platform. Netflix is the business of deploying production dollars. You know, Walmart is in the business of like, hey, send us what your skew rate is going to look like on the shelf like. So they're all used. They need a communication tool. And today, their communication tool is PowerPoint, yeah, or something that someone has photoshopped with a design agency. And it would just be easier if you could mock that up using AI and send it. It was good enough to be able to send it someplace else. That's how we view the motion. What's different from that go to market motion is we're not a dev tool, right? So you're integrated with AWS, and you're hosted there. The problem is, AWS hosts a lot of tools, and so you have growth. And I think my challenge is, I don't think there's a real business there, long run adversity, double hugging face, like they are platforms. And so almost all the value includes to the infrastructure level, right? And to silicon, and then all of these people who are kind of like the middleware type of stuff. Middleware in the content business has always been a shitty business. I don't even understand why people think it's a real business, because maybe you end up at the end, like, even in code, you'll know it's so rare to find something in middle where you know it's essential. It's just hard to become a venture backed business. I agree. So we've taken the side of like, we know who customers are. We know we can charge them. They're giving us money. We know the models underneath that. We can sub them out. If this one's too expensive, something cheaper will come out. But we know the interesting US side. We know silicon is going to get, keep getting paid, and so all that's left is through the applications. We're not big believers that take spline, for example, a raised a ship load of money, lots and lots of customers still running out of cash? Why? Because it's an asset creation model, and we just entered the AI era where anyone can

We know silicon is going to get, keep getting paid, and so all that's left is through the applications. We're not big believers that take spline, for example, a raised a ship load of money, lots and lots of customers still running out of cash? Why? Because it's an asset creation model, and we just entered the AI era where anyone can
the ease of use of self serve and a plg motion that's pushing it bottoms up into the organizations, and building a tool that can spread by itself and sort of has extensive legal mind users, and then separately, AWS, or like a Tatari, or like any of these ad networks, they also want to start providing it for free, because they're trying to generate ads on their platform. Netflix is the business of deploying production dollars. You know, Walmart is in the business of like, hey, send us what your skew rate is going to look like on the shelf like. So they're all used. They need a communication tool. And today, their communication tool is PowerPoint, yeah, or something that someone has photoshopped with a design agency. And it would just be easier if you could mock that up using AI and send it. It was good enough to be able to send it someplace else. That's how we view the motion. What's different from that go to market motion is we're not a dev tool, right? So you're integrated with AWS, and you're hosted there. The problem is, AWS hosts a lot of tools, and so you have growth. And I think my challenge is, I don't think there's a real business there, long run adversity, double hugging face, like they are platforms. And so almost all the value includes to the infrastructure level, right? And to silicon, and then all of these people who are kind of like the middleware type of stuff. Middleware in the content business has always been a shitty business. I don't even understand why people think it's a real business, because maybe you end up at the end, like, even in code, you'll know it's so rare to find something in middle where you know it's essential. It's just hard to become a venture backed business. I agree. So we've taken the side of like, we know who customers are. We know we can charge them. They're giving us money. We know the models underneath that. We can sub them out. If this one's too expensive, something cheaper will come out. But we know the interesting US side.

S Speaker 120:03How are you getting a lot of those customers today? We just announced, we announced, and the list went nuts. This is five days old, so it's well over 2000 at this point in time. But the demand continues to exist today. The demand hasn't been filled out yet, because 3d is hard to orchestrate. Like everything we've built in the system is actually very, very hard to do, especially inside of a browser, because it's a game engine and web and you're using AI elements of the top of it to orchestrate it. So there's a reason people haven't built it, is because it's really, really hard. Unity had already done a year and a half worth of development that we were able to spin out of unity. So this was going to be product line within Unity, like a public company product line. So Unity went through restructuring. It's an accident of history. We were able to spin it out, right? So we know the audience has existed for a long time. Why do you know? Why do more people not build for this audience? Is because everyone imagines

21:04the money is in production.
the money is in production.
the money is in production.
the money is in production.
S Speaker 121:08Yeah. And then that's an awfully specific that everyone is sitting around going, Oh, that's where the money is. We should build more production tools, because fidelity is very, very sexy in our space. But if you look at Unreal Engine and unity, the two leading game engines of our space, the engines themselves are loss leaders. They're like Windows people. They're giving them away in order to build the app ecosystem on top of them. They're free middleware in order to build content right and keep customers on the platform. That's the same way we think about it. You know, we don't have any unique thoughts around it, other than we really think either this is going to be 80% as good as a production tool, but 100 times faster and good enough to send someone and convey the idea or it's not. And we think that's a large use case. We think it's very valuable. And we think it is like, when we go back to numbers, you can get all of the production people in film and games, the hardcore use cases, and I think also engineering. People really like to get into this. That's 2 million people. Yeah, people using Adobe is closer to 50 million people. People using Canvas, 35 million Maus. If you had to guess as to how much figma was, you'd think it's about the same, or maybe it's slightly less, yeah, figma has 3 million Maus. It's a 40x difference in market only because people go, Well, you know, sorority girls make flyers like, you know, how many people? Like? How many people can there be? And it turns out there's a lot more people living this. So if you can make 3d easily enough with these four spaces, again, we're not trying to make everything easy, and it looks professional enough, and you can be in the flow of business, we think that's a pretty like, 40 bucks is going to seem like a steal for those people to pay every month if they close one extra

S Speaker 123:10so anything that you can, I think you should evaluate it. You know, the same thing about this is, this is look out of the VC for five years. This is what I'd write down my thesis, so you have some proof points around. Have they actually, is anyone actually using the system? Are they able to do useful stuff in it? Do they feel like it's good enough? So we have reviews at that level. We are going into closed beta right now, and we'll have will be public with even more data at that point in time. So it's not like, and you have the Unity data points, so there's lots of evidence that the market exists. You have recent data points around the fact that it works. And then I think I would say, like, you know, what's exciting? Why will it not get promoted? Because there's still a lot to build right everything you're seeing right now in the system attic, what we want to get to, and the knowledge graph and the systems we built will allow that Jeep to drive through that forest, and it will allow the cameras to move so you can get that drone shot. You're going to be able to turn those into images. We're going to be able to turn those into video. So you're going to be able to do all of that stuff running in a browser, which is insane and without processing, sits at the edge, at the browser level, how much stuff sits at the cloud, how you balance those things? Build it to the UX. It's not an easy product to build. You can graph this onto a runway workflow that will be much, much harder to do because they went with the prompt based workflow Florida did the same thing. That's the bet they've made, right? So that's how I think about it, and I think of the work that has to be done, right? Like, if you want the drone shot, I will give you an example. Here's things the system can't do today. This drone shot, I just need this camera to fly around as this brief is driving through. I need this front shot, and I need the camera to follow around today, if I had to do it, let me just show you what this would look like. I think I have the video over here somewhere. Changes.

S Speaker 226:31know, where do we fit within the market? That makes sense. But in your deck, do you somewhere have, I don't want to take a lot of time on that, but do you somewhere have a space where you can sort of give me a sense of how big the market is on just pitching and versus the entire production market?
know, where do we fit within the market? That makes sense. But in your deck, do you somewhere have, I don't want to take a lot of time on that, but do you somewhere have a space where you can sort of give me a sense of how big the market is on just pitching and versus the entire production market?

S Speaker 126:49Yeah, I would love to, I think it's so I will say this, every product, every piece of content, starts out with a pitch, unless you're like a YouTuber making content by yourself. So I would say on this side, when you're looking these creators and consumers, a good chunk of them, probably, they don't have to pitch anything, because you can just create it. That's not it. That's not a market that we want to spend that much time on. We want to spend time on the boundary between the big circle and the medium sized circle, which is where Canva built its living. But there's enough people in a team setting where you're trying to convey a concept, marching bands, school plays, your local trade show events, there's a lot of stuff that's sitting in that nexus. That's how people learn to use them. But now they're able to do more professional, great stuff than they were able to do before, because they were not Adobe Express subscribers that you know, like they're just too complex for them. So they're able to sit in the browser and try it out, and they start getting and then they start climbing the ladder. Those same people go get jobs in agencies, and now they're able to create those things. My guess is it's probably 1500 million people that would have this because a it's global, it's again, film, games, agencies and events. I don't think film and games production. That's only 2 million people. If you add up all the people working in film and games, it's not more than 2 million people. Yeah. So when you see the super sexy things, like, you know, oh, you can get to this level of fidelity, they're literally talking a million people, right? And after that, the needs become thinner, right? It's like, oh, you're going to compete with Photoshop or Illustrator, and that's the Adobe crowd. And that 50 million thing, the difference between 50 and $100 million 100 million people is basically all of those people that want a browser based downloadable that's collaborative and something that is intuitive, workflow as opposed to learning engineering to do it, they're not going to use cursor and sonnet to vibe code stuff into a browser. They're not levels IO, right? That's a interesting thing, because it makes engineers job easier, yeah, but it doesn't actually make like, my

That's not a market that we want to spend that much time on. We want to spend time on the boundary between the big circle and the medium sized circle, which is where Canva built its living. But there's enough people in a team setting where you're trying to convey a concept, marching bands, school plays, your local trade show events, there's a lot of stuff that's sitting in that nexus. That's how people learn to use them. But now they're able to do more professional, great stuff than they were able to do before, because they were not Adobe Express subscribers that you know, like they're just too complex for them. So they're able to sit in the browser and try it out, and they start getting and then they start climbing the ladder. Those same people go get jobs in agencies, and now they're able to create those things. My guess is it's probably 1500 million people that would have this because a it's global, it's again, film, games, agencies and events. I don't think film and games production. That's only 2 million people. If you add up all the people working in film and games, it's not more than 2 million people. Yeah. So when you see the super sexy things, like, you know, oh, you can get to this level of fidelity, they're literally talking a million people, right? And after that, the needs become thinner, right? It's like, oh, you're going to compete with Photoshop or Illustrator, and that's the Adobe crowd. And that 50 million thing, the difference between 50 and $100 million 100 million people is basically all of those people that want a browser based downloadable that's collaborative and something that is intuitive, workflow as opposed to learning engineering to do it, they're not going to use cursor and sonnet to vibe code stuff into a browser. They're not levels IO, right? That's a interesting thing, because it makes engineers job easier, yeah, but it doesn't actually make like, my

S Speaker 129:40that's a good question. So, you know, this slide we talked about a little bit, you know, last year, we put in place what we call intangible OS, all the underpinnings of the logic of that sits on our side, that farms out requests to say, foundational models. When you say, create a city, what's in a city? Blah, blah, blah. But our model now has to the logic of, how do you lay it out cities or grid layouts with different type buildings, and you have to connect to the populator and have streets, and the cars drive on streets, but and people can sit in cars, but cars don't sit in people. Also that, you know, the models are dumb, the pixel predicting models are done. That stuff that we had to build, yeah, curate, what you're seeing is a manifestation of that, an intangible studio. We will have a v2 of agents, which first to do automation of creative tasks, like behaviors, scene creation. So when you say, like, I want the Jeep moving through the forest, you don't have to go manually strip every single thing, it will start driving to the projects. It will know not to collide with trees. It will a lot of the basic things it should know, which is what people are trying to get to do. If you have to do the same thing in unity, you never get there. But also, if you had to try and prompt it in one way, you would get something. But every time you change it, it would be harder to change. And then finally, like, we end up as closer to, you know, the Shopify ecosystem, where people are creating templates and they're selling them. People are creating plugins. When you say, like, you know, I want this movie shot in the James Cameron style, I should be able to say, I want this movie shot in Priyesh style, right? And you are the one marketing your plugin, but it all sits on the system, because with the system, it wouldn't exist. And then, you know, there's an economy around that that we make money off of. So we're trying to build this to be a real platform, not not like a one time. Let's build a production tool that serves a specific need, after which it loses utility. And that's the roadmap. The roadmap is designed to make the product more valuable. Yeah, not we have solved every technical challenge, and once we do that,
that's a good question.

S Speaker 231:34now you're in the commoditization space, right? And last question, I think we are over time. So when you're raising a 2 million round, if we are to come in, I guess we would preferably want a 1.5 to 2 million allocation in that.

S Speaker 131:49Would you be willing to sort of carve that out for us? I can, I think there are two paths we're going to go down, where they're going to do this $2 million save, which feels like there's plenty of demand for or one of our insiders might be the $5 million round, because they want to own more of the business. Yeah, they both own 10% right now and recent cross link, but they like more ahead of that x valuation. But I don't know which of those two paths, but by the end of this week, I should have round construction clear. If we do the 5 million, that probably be a price round, just so we don't have just littering our cap table. We did a price round last time, so we don't have that problem now.
