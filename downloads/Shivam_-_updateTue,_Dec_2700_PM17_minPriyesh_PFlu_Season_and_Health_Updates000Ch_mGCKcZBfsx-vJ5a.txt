S Speaker 10:00You Hey, all good. Yeah, I'll get a little bit under the weather the last couple of days. But I say life is going on. What happened? Flu thinks so it's apparently flu season team, maybe they're down so flu shots. Every year they like have this free flu shot vaccination program, skip Indian gold immunity. Maybe, clearly not. I think that all of this is

S Speaker 15:50Interesting, bro and and I haven't spent a lot of time here, but I am assuming this would be different from the problem that say these sandbox companies are solving the day tuners e to be or,

S Speaker 26:05Yes, there will be an overlap, right? So to see the again, the sandbox thing, basically, like, you know, has two parts it to here you need, like, a high fidelity program. So, like, you know, you will either be giving, let's say, so let's say, give me an example of, like, you know, what sandboxes, as they do, the opera does

S Speaker 16:23so Daytona would Daytona, I know, powers chat GPT is entire coding say, anytime it has to spin up a terminal and then run a code it that is powered by Daytona, yeah.
so Daytona would Daytona, I know, powers chat GPT is entire coding say, anytime it has to spin up a terminal and then run a code it that is powered by Daytona, yeah.
so Daytona would Daytona, I know, powers chat GPT is entire coding say, anytime it has to spin up a terminal and then run a code it that is powered by Daytona, yeah.
so Daytona would Daytona, I know, powers chat GPT is entire coding say, anytime it has to spin up a terminal and then run a code it that is powered by Daytona, yeah.
S Speaker 26:39So I think Daytona, like, you know, in that case, basically is doing like, you know, a part of it. So I think this entire like, you know, think about basically spinning up, like, you know, terminals on demand and stuff like that. I think is basically the problem that we are looking to solve as well. But we want to, like, you know, extend it to any kind of an environment, so it can be like, you know, according terminal, it can be a chromium instance. It can be like, you know, basically VM running like, you know, kind of Salesforce type instance, or anything like that, right? So on your different that's the idea, and your

S Speaker 17:14differentiation would come in from the point key Daytona would be more production, high scale thing, you will be more paralyzed, deeper into observability, more experimentation in terms of when, when developers use it, if I'm getting it, yeah.

S Speaker 27:29So we would basically come in the post screening step. So I would not basically, like, be the inference provider, or like, you know, like, basically the infrastructure at inference. So what detona, like noon would do is they would like to either spin up a terminal or either spin up a chromium instance for the operator to work in production. I would not like, you know, basically, power any of that. But what GPT would need is like, you know, post training infrastructure where they can, like, you know, first do millions of these runs before they can roll it out production. So I want to be that kind of player. And if you like it, to think about it. The Eton app problem is a very specific problem, right? Where you are, like, you know, kind of offering these sort of, like, you know, production instances. But think about enterprise workflows, right? So enterprise workflows you would not, like, you know, need these instances to spin up in production. In production, the agent will be working on the real tools. But you would need, like, you know, a bunch of these, like, you know, in pre production or post training, whatever. So, yeah, that is the idea. And one other good thing about this is that, like, you know, it's an, it's a hardcore distributed systems engineering problem. It's not any research problem. And you have like, tons of engineers in India, like, you know, who are, like, really great at building those systems. Oh, yeah, that's the like, you know, basically, approach. And, like, you know, reasons why I'm thinking about this. I wanted your feedback on, like, you know, basically, what do you think about this? From initial reactions,

S Speaker 19:02yeah, I will have to do a lot more research. I think bhi may utna well educated naiyun, to give you at least a learned feedback from from what I know top level, I think makes a lot of sense. There's definitely a lot of pull. Most of the companies, or at least application companies I speak to, they are starting to sort of think about, how do we create evals? How do we start post training? How do we run RL? So it seems like the market is just starting on this front bot, top level, if you can send me some materials to read, I can I can do a better job at

S Speaker 29:40it, you're going to basically, what we are thinking is, like, you know, if we can get, let's say, push out an MVP, like, you know, this part, maybe, like, you know, get a few early people to, like, test this out. Probably, like, no, in Jan, we would love to, like, you know, kind of raise behind this idea and start, like, building from there. So that's the idea. So I don't have any materials on me. Unfortunately, I would just like, you know, basically trying to reach out to people who basically are in the ecosystem and would know more than us. That's why I thought we'll do this call one request like, you know, I have for you is, like, you know, you spoke about these application companies who are do post creating, right? Yes. So can you like, you know, send me a few names, or connect me to a few folks to whom, like, you know, I can just, like, pitch this idea and get their feedback, or maybe, like, you know, convert them to a potential, like, you
it, you're going to basically, what we are thinking is, like, you know, if we can get, let's say, push out an MVP, like, you know, this part, maybe, like, you know, get a few early people to, like, test this out.

S Speaker 211:11because all of these would need to teach their models a bunch of cool calls, right? So I think that's basically the system is sort of good for them. Yeah, yeah. I'm just, like, thinking of, like, you know, spinning up a landing page and, like, just sending you some blood. I would be really great if you could, like, you know, make these connects.

S Speaker 111:29100% 100% bro. So from say, I have my own sort of database of companies I track. So if I have to filter companies, I am assuming complex workflows. A lot of tool calls highly specific workflows. These would be the target application companies I would say. I would

S Speaker 211:55you know, application company would be doing post screening, right, using RL, so it doesn't have to be a complicated workflow, right? Let's say, for example, like, you know, there is a fairhouse company for insurance, right? Just not a complex workflow. It's like, totally two or three steps only. But they are like, you know, seeing 90% efficiency on GBT. But if they want to use quin or, like, some other open source model and do RN, maybe 95% so if they are trying to do that, I'm like, basically, I think they are the ICP,

S Speaker 112:24yeah, yeah, probably this company. I met them recently. Further AI, Indian founders know them. There's another video generation company creates AI video ads, runs them on internet tracks, uses RL to refine their prompts and entire execution woman to make better ads. I think, like another
yeah, yeah, probably this company. I met them recently. Further AI, Indian founders know them. There's another video generation company creates AI video ads, runs them on internet tracks, uses RL to refine their prompts and entire execution woman to make better ads. I think, like another

S Speaker 212:49I think like, you know, to be a good validation for us as well. Yeah, the other thing I wanted to ask, like, you know, you know, like, you know, any folks from the uh, any of these, like, big platforms, who like, whose opinion I wanted on the architecture, right? Because how so we wanted to, like to be really right with the architecture, right? So it's a massive, like, you know, orchestration systems problem. And I don't know anyone better than Databricks or rubric or Nutanix. Who does it?
I think like, you know, to be a good validation for us as well.

S Speaker 113:29So I know a person had rubrics, Indian guy, bits, bits, Pilani, so he could be one person. I'm not sure background fit, or maybe I can float him around coach or loopy ho sit there. Let me think
So I know a person had rubrics, Indian guy, bits, bits, Pilani, so he could be one person. I'm not sure background fit, or maybe I can float him around coach or loopy ho sit there. Let me think

S Speaker 113:59I i know this investor who's in who was an early investor at Databricks Foundation, capital, kilos, random float, karunga, or I'll start asking
I i know this investor who's in who was an early investor at Databricks Foundation, capital, kilos, random float, karunga, or I'll start asking

S Speaker 214:17people and any, any advice, like, you know, one fundraise. So actually, let me put this more structured question. So, what is the bare minimum?

Ki, tike, kucho ka bot Sare, money lose, there'll be some winners, and everyone's trying to hunt for them. I don't think funding ecosystem for early stage companies is going down anytime soon, January days. I don't think. But from from milestones perspective, if you have some of these, say, hotter category startups as your design partners, that should be enough of a milestone to raise your first round. Shall if your architecture is ready or design partners and you get good feedback from them, I think early stage investors, like pre seed seed investors, go kill a enough validation over

S Speaker 215:37Got it? Got it? Sounds good. So, yeah, I'm working towards that milestone only right now. Just like, you know, do a, like, a quick validation and build sprint this month, see where we are, and then speak May, like, you know, we can just think how to go about the fundraise, actually, India, because investors here don't get it, yeah, waste of my time, right? They like, you know, spend more cycles, right? What has happened? There are, like, no folks in the valley. They like, if you tell them a couple of clients, they'll get what you are building. But that's what the idea is. So let's see first, like, you know, let's try. If this works or not.
