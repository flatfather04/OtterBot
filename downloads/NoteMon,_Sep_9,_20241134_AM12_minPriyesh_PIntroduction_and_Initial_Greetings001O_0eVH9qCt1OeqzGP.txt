S Speaker 10:17up for the most of us, I if it thumbs up,
S Speaker 10:24are you calling because I was I'm not sure if you are New York based or you Bay Area based. Yeah, I'm Bay Area based. The fund is also based in Bay area, so most of our team members are in the base Bay Area, and some of us are in San Diego.

S Speaker 10:41I can never tell. You know, some of these ventures, some

S Speaker 10:49sometimes you think most of the people are from the area, but very often they're not. So I'm not from New York. I don't work in New York or anything like that. I I'm based in Chicago, and my firm's based in Philadelphia, so absolutely nothing to do with New York, but I was in town for some meetings, and I thought was a good way to sort of have a look to see if there are some interesting ventures, interesting with deep tech funds as well. So I can sort of give you a little bit of a background on me and my fund. Would, of course, love to hear both as well, for sure, as I, as I mentioned, where, you know, where East Coast based, but we invest nationally or even globally. We've been around. We're OC university partners, or up for short, we've been around for about a decade and a half, and we specialize in investing in university spin outs. We've raised nearly a billion dollars around this sort of One Piece since we don't invest exclusively in SPIN outs, but about 90% of our investments are spin outs or in this in the sort of ecosystem of university commercialization, let's say, and within that field, we are looking at pretty much anything you can commercialize from a university, and that typically you can break into sort of Life Sciences, and, you know, detect, I'd say, and for Life Sciences, we're looking at mostly therapeutics. We also look at some medical devices and some diagnostics. And for everything else, it's anything you can imagine. So we invest in semiconductor and chips. We invest in comms technology. We invest in materials, robotics, photonics, you know, networking, cyber, anything you can do research on which has some commercial value and can be spent out we we look at and in order to make these investments, we partner with over 100 universities from across the country

S Speaker 13:17And these universities are essentially the 100 top research institutions in the country, our core part partners, which are sort of 20 of the top universities in the countries, include Harvard, Stanford, MIT, UBL, Princeton, the UC schools, pretty much anyone who's doing Any research partner really closely. And in these core partnerships, we have essentially a contractual agreement with the University that we are able to invest on their behalf in any university spin out they have an interest in. And that could be an equity pro rata, right, or it could be participation right through the lighting agreement between the university and the startup. So our university partnerships gives us two main things. One, it really gives us direct investing access as a right agreed in some of these top spin outs, which occasionally become very, very hot property in venture in the deep tech space, of course, and it also serves as a pipeline, you know, a ton of spin outs in detect in the deep tech space that essentially come to our doorstep, channeled to us by university partners because of our contractual arrangement with them. So, yeah, that's sort of a little bit about what we do. It's, it's a little bit convoluted, but, you know, we invest up and down the funding rounds. It could be C, it could be a, b, c. We don't, we don't mind, as long as a thesis is right. Our check sizes range from one to 3 million for c3, to five for series A and for B, anything up to 8 million

S Speaker 15:15we typically don't bleed. That's because we're spread really thin, as you can imagine. We partner with countries, people, you know, looking multiple spaces, life sciences. So we tend to follow, so our check sizes are sort of follow on check sizes, but we see a lot of good stuff, and we are very, very liberal in sharing our our deal flow in our pipeline, because we want our university partners to match their technologies with VCs, and sometimes we also want to co invest with with people who either follow or lead. It doesn't, it doesn't really matter. So we're incredibly generous with the pipeline. Well, that that was a very comprehensive overview. Thanks a lot for that need. Sounds very interesting. I am just curious on one thing. I am a recent graduate from UCLA. I completed my MBA there, and then, since then, I've moved to Qualcom ventures. Why? How does the model work? Why do Why are universities so keen on giving you an exclusive provider rights, because I know for UCLA, they had an internal technology development group, is what they used to call it, and that group was specifically aimed to commercialize all the research which comes out of the university, and had a licensing sort of partnership there. So just curious about the entire model. Yeah, so UCLA is one of our partners, and

S Speaker 16:49in the sense that this right cannot be passed on to any other PC. But if UCLA should wish to invest in a startup, and there's a limited allocation through which they're able to access with the interest in the company. What typically happens is, contractually, it's split between us and the university, yeah, so UCLA will take 50% of the allocation will take 50 that's contractually. But practice, in practice, what happens is, it's just a negotiation with the university. Is like, Hey, you want to put your your money in the full right? Okay, we, as OEP, will just, you know, we'll, we'll take a step back and allow you to and so in some cases, there is very little friction between us and them. But what ends up happening is that there are tons of startups spinning out that just have no one interested in them. Yeah, so having someone who is taking a look and either deciding to invest or, you know, being able to channel that startup towards a VC partner that might be interested, and that's why we like to build our network. And as I said, we're very generous pipeline because we can't invest in everything, but we want our partners to benefit from sharing their pipeline with us. You know you're able to connect them with other people. The second reason why we have this is because nobody no as well. Oh, sorry, you just booked it. Am I bad? I saw that room was open. Ni, give me a say, and I'll have to move rooms. But just no worries catching back in a minute. No worries. Oh, sorry about that. No, No. I Love The room.

S Speaker 19:44Hey, hi, Ni, sorry about that. So on Mondays, we visit office, and I had not booked the conference room as using so I can move around. Yeah,
Hey, hi, Ni, sorry about that. So on Mondays, we visit office, and I had not booked the conference room as using so I can move around. Yeah,

Hey, hi, Ni, sorry about that. So on Mondays, we visit office, and I had not booked the conference room as using so I can move around. Yeah,
S Speaker 111:22right? No, that's that's very exciting, for sure. Seems like the network is quite extensively I'm curious again, how do you guys internally manage it and within the team like I can imagine you getting strong deal flow from several geographies and several industries like you mentioned. How do you split it between the teams? How do you look at everything so
