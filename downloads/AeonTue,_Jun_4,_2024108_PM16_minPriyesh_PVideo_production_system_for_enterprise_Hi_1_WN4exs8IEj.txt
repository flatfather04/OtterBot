S Speaker 30:48So Dan, while while the sharp fixes it up, yeah. Do you? Can you answer this does the system right now if I'm supposed to use that word? Does it video fie. A lot of content places or can it also repurpose? So what I mean with that is, can I give it multiple websites and ask it to consolidate all the Bluetooth speakers across these different websites and create an overall video for it?

S Speaker 11:10Yeah, you absolutely can. So for example, if I pick something here. I say, what is the source for this video? There's a number of options. So one is the website URL, but one URL, the other one is multiple URLs. So exactly to your point, if I have multiple pages, I want to just combine all the information together to make one video out of you can do that too. You can also provide a script. You can provide plain text existing images or video this so there's a number of different ways of sort of starting the process.

S Speaker 12:29so so the goal is that we really should be at about a million ARR at least tracking towards a million ARR towards the end of the school year. So in q4, we should be at a millionaire ours, Michael. And as far as this round, we're looking for you know, somewhat depends, if I wouldn't say sort of one to three to build this initial team. Right. So probably get a cylinder I would give that sort of Chief scientists label that that is quite quite adept at tuning these models. And a few other folks that are maybe more dedicated to video technology. speech technology is also a big big deal. So really sort of building out the team and then also building out you know, sales as well. And yeah, so that's the goal. And I think that that you have today, these

S Speaker 13:39mean, no one has soul tie. So I'd say it's, it's about five contractors. They're all part time. Yeah.

S Speaker 24:17And I think I can I can see a lot of publishers and a lot of other content creators getting excited first. The fact that you're going after, you know enterprise will pay you is not predictability in the business. Absolutely. For us, you know, like I think this might be we'll have to discuss it and I'll discuss we will discuss internally, maybe around who are we ideally like to see that 1 million ARR before making a decision and it's got to do with our initial check size. You know, we want to be five to seven to seven. Yeah, we do like one to $2 million every year so yeah. What a corporate back office work which is totally get it. But I what I want to do is we can we can go try it out, right. You can go play with it.

S Speaker 15:22Yeah, I can. I think we have a demo account. I can give you access,
Yeah, I can. I think we have a demo account. I can give you access,
Yeah, I can. I think we have a demo account. I can give you access,
Yeah, I can. I think we have a demo account. I can give you access,
S Speaker 25:25you can give us a demo account. That would be great. If you could give us a demo account, and you can go play with it. That would be great. And then we might have a few questions and send it send me Okay. Sure. And then still discussing internally for this round. So you I'm guessing you're just starting out, just see fundraising. Yeah,
you can give us a demo account. That would be great. If you could give us a demo account, and you can go play with it. That would be great.

S Speaker 19:39I think they will. They're not there yet. It's a little too in the weeds for them. You know? I mean, they, if we tell them that, hey, the videos are just getting better and they can see the engagement time is getting and they don't really know how it got there. They're generally fine with that. I

S Speaker 29:58was curious about that. Because you know, like, you know, they're treating this as still as a black box or they want to know more. Okay, if I make this change, then I have better engagement.

S Speaker 110:12There, you know, I think they'll get there. I mean, there's still it's fascinating. For me, you guys see the other side of the table this but for all of the hype and dollars and excitement and everything around AI. I'm telling you query a dozen random people in a large enterprise. And like, maybe two of them have kind of tried chat GPT like, you know, a month ago or something like that. I mean, they still sort of they're like really early to it, you know, I mean, yeah. But that will change, you know, customer support. But,

S Speaker 210:57but, yeah, adoption is still learning. And
S Speaker 111:01so I feel like there is such a gap. That's why that one site is new. There's such a gap between these models and having something enterprise ready. I mean, it's such a huge leap. And the industry is like pretty far. So it's it's so that's why I know what we're doing is valuable because it's it's like you know, the these are not usable off the shelf. Really. Not in an enterprise, right. I mean, we have to give there's like a certain way you could spell TripAdvisor there's no space has to be lowercase A like that's done. They freak out if it's still any other way. So you can't just like have these models with their temperature just sort of running free like doing whatever.
