S Speaker 23:22okay, so, yeah, it's great to start building relationships, so you make sure you who you invested into. That's very important. So here, so here's my background. I am US citizen. I moved to United States 15 years ago from small countries, Uzbekistan, yeah, so classical immigrant story. I live in Ohio, Cleveland, $2 so very standard thing, like a story of the immigrant came here and climb up. So yeah. So basically the newest platform was like first productivity platform to get the knowledge to test the market, find our UVP. So basically we can just skip it, because we just moved to the to large field. And the goal was to identify the niche, to identify how we are different on the market and the business model. So we did a lot of experiments in the in this Nimbus, and then once we found that we decided to focus on a few space, on a new launch. So we did the early launch. It's almost like a year ago, a little bit more like maybe 14 months. We have a really great team. We became one of the most selling tools on AppSumo. Are you familiar with AppSumo? Yes, our record. There is back then, in three weeks, we sold over half of the million hours in three weeks. So we did very well in execution. Yeah. So when we launched, we became, this time, top two, top three, more selling tools. Same time we launched in a product fund, we became the product of the day, the product of the week, a product of the month, and Product of the Year, and collaboration space, interesting,
okay, so, yeah, it's great to start building relationships, so you make sure you who you invested into. That's very important. So here, so here's my background. I am US citizen.

So that's a few space.
So that's a few space.
So that's a few space.
S Speaker 212:18Also one of the growth strategies, how we're gonna grow. We partner with the integration agencies that integrate CRM systems. So for example, we were in a partner with this company. They have spot Platinum Partner. They made make money on boarding, promoting to their clients, $30,000 with us, just for the starters. So the thing is, like these companies will benefit us, integrating and bringing us to the companies. And if you think about, like, half span selling companies, just to 4000 sales force, that's 10s of the 1000s, that's a huge opportunity just for that. Because,

S Speaker 213:06of that ceramics, they don't do what we do, and the revenues themselves if they need us and they need AI, that's why partnering with such agencies is a huge win for us. So So where are you going to go? So what kind of questions you have? I think covers out the metrics. I can tell you about this. So what are you interested

S Speaker 113:35so, Paul, a couple of questions on the product before we dive into metrics. So you mentioned you start your workflow starts after the CRM. How do you sort of see all of the sales support, AI agents, lead generation, AI agents come and do you see them sort of ending at your workflow and then fuse based takes over after that? Or do you see them competing with you?

Or do you see them competing with you?
S Speaker 214:00Yes, good question. So at this stage, when a pre sales, when you start engaging. So in the long run, we can provide agents for lead generation. But because we are at a seed stage, we I don't want to focus. I've been very focused on what we do. So that's why we start on like a sales deal rooms. And also, I forgot to show you and you can do your research. Gartner says, like 30% of the will be used in sales rooms. One is the reason behind that everyone watching is competitors, and once they see that the new company, they can better utilize a new tool to close deals, they're going to use it as well.
Yes, good question. So at this stage, when a pre sales, when you start engaging. So in the long run, we can provide agents for lead generation.

S Speaker 114:42Yeah, yeah. I sort of agree that digital sales rooms and deal rooms would be a big focus area, even in startups, even in venture investing, we see a lot of companies coming up with digital data rooms now than before. Before it would be more of a Google Drive, but now it's well organized. It's a deal room over there. What
Yeah, yeah. I sort of agree that digital sales rooms and deal rooms would be a big focus area, even in startups, even in venture investing, we see a lot of companies coming up with digital data rooms now than before.

S Speaker 215:06the main value is here? Because once you bring the processes, you can streamline operations. Because this is, like, the main impact, how much so you need less? Like, you have less. Need less sales people. Well, your sales will people will work as like, like, two times more salespeople you might have. So this is like the value. But in order to sell this, we need to sell, basically provide the value to the collaboration. This is like, where a lot of companies vertical solutions, they fail because they can't talk well

S Speaker 221:10So I think we will be around series A in terms of the revenue. So right now, the revenue, right now is $45,000 so basically, if you double it, there's going to be series A and also, like, we are sustainable. So what I recently did, I cut the team because we did the SMB part. Now we are focusing to large companies. So I got the team our run rate. Basically, it's like 20 plus months, and who's the growth is going to be in Iran position that we can fundraise, if we have a good potential, like a strategic partnership, or something that brings value. If not, I'm not in a hurry, so I will wait to get to Series A, and we'll close the series.

S Speaker 121:57Absolutely Paul, I think, from our perspective, having a bit more traction to show for it would be better for us to evaluate this actively. We have made one investment in this space, not exactly the same, but we have made an investment in Cresta, which is, if you see it, it will be one of the companies which will probably sort of end where your workflow starts, and then you can take over from that.
