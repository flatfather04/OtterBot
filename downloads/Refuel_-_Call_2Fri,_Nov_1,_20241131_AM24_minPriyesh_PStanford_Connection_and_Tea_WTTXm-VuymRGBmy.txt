S Speaker 20:46So amazing. I mean, he's at this point, like, I've known Tanner, like, nine years because we overlapped at Stanford. I mean, of course, he was smart enough to go to business school. I was in the School of Engineering, but, but we met and I Yeah, but yeah, he's been a, he's been a good friend for a long time. So I was just like, I saw the announcement this morning, and I was like, wow, that's, that's kind of amazing, that that Qualcomm at the CDC, yeah, small world. So

S Speaker 11:18no, those guys are amazing. It's actually, I tell them my favorite team and then, like, oh, you tell everybody that. But it is not true. The reason, there's reasons why. There's two reasons. One, cameras and computer vision are near and dear to my heart. And two, these guys, they, I mean, the energy that they have right now in execution I've seen, I've been part of many teams like that, and then, while I used to build and ship stuff to do more useful stuff, so I can see that energy of shipping More than many other teams that I worked with. So teams. That's amazing.
no, those guys are amazing. It's actually, I tell them my favorite team and then, like, oh, you tell everybody that. But it is not true. The reason, there's reasons why. There's two reasons.

S Speaker 12:59Right now, how do you see this market? Which is this market creation opportunity? Or, you know, an existing market opportunity? It's a market creation from my standpoint, but it's happening. And then the question is, you know, okay, 4 million next year, eight, 10 million next year, you know, where, like, does this? Where do you see this? And how, how are you envisioning this market opening up for what you're doing? And then, how do you see your company bonding over the next so that's more macro, big question, and we can even address it, you know, maybe have more time at the latest. Yeah, the other question that is more near term is you said you started serving mL from went from your persona being ml engineers to VP of engineering, or your regular engineers, right? Yeah, which is and then. So in order to do that, what are specific things that you had to do in order to change your product?

S Speaker 25:18Okay, awesome. I mean, look, I think, and, you know, Charlie you and I probably chatted about this a little bit, which is, like, like, a lot of the eot that exists today, like, will need to be redesigned completely, because, you know, we're moving from just structured to structured plus unstructured data. Type of computers changing, but very importantly, like, how you actually do data transformation like that itself, like would require new workflows, because AI kind of messes things up for, you know, the people who use it like, it's like, no longer like, no longer 100% correct. You have to think about which model you have to think about quality, you have to think about like, there's a bunch of new things that teams have to think about. And so when we think about this question of existing market versus market creation. Look, the biggest opportunity, frankly, is like the market is going to expand quite dramatically, because until today, all the sort of transformation that was happening was like SQL, Python, type of compute. And of course, there's big players that already that are doing it slow takes like 90% of revenue. Is just like the computer transformed it out into their overall revenue. And then you look at all of these industries whose data will need to be transformed to build the AI types of software that's net new market creation. Having said that, like we're very focused on solving real problems today and sort of not going after things that look like experimental dollars. And so the way we look at the market is, look, there's massive market opportunity and expansion that is going to happen, for sure, every rag application, and I know I were chatting about the Qualcomm rack applications that the team is looking to build like they will need tons of data processing and cleaning and structuring. But just today as well, there are existing, known use cases in industries that you know we care about that will benefit from Refuel just as it stands. And so our focus on like, how do we go from that, you know, 1 million to 5 million, or zero to 5 million, frankly, is like, look, we know which industries. We know the types of use cases where refill is an instant fit. Let's just go and say, like, Hey, we're going to replace how work is currently being done, which is by a combination of people, rules, based systems, simple machine learning models. Let's just replace this and do it significantly better, and then show what the ROI comes out to be. And so that ends up leading us in this direction of like, okay, what are the industries? What is the size of that industry? What is the size of the market for us, right? If we go and solve those use cases and so forth, and then what is the core ICP that we go and sell to? And I can spend a little bit of time digging into that the

S Speaker 18:16and all of this is since transitioning to an LLM based interface, yeah, just for these particular use cases alone, there is no but is that still a market trick? Is that industry how recipient is that industry to changing that overnight now or not overnight next two years too? Because there's, I'm sure there's some use cases, if it broke, then, you know, like most of banking transaction still done on mainframes today.

That's because if it broke, then
That's because if it broke, then
S Speaker 18:50don't change. Is that the mentality still? Or did you think there are and which area specifically are they more interested in actually using llms as an interface versus SQL queries?
don't change. Is that the mentality still? Or did you think there are and which area specifically are they more interested in actually using llms as an interface versus SQL queries?

It's, it's essentially these three verticals. We did, we did sign
11:17tech mean, like,
S Speaker 211:19it's just, you can imagine just technology companies, right? Yeah, yeah. So, for example, like FinTech companies, HR, tech companies is a bunch of these.
it's just, you can imagine just technology companies, right? Yeah, yeah. So, for example, like FinTech companies, HR, tech companies is a bunch of these.
it's just, you can imagine just technology companies, right? Yeah, yeah. So, for example, like FinTech companies, HR, tech companies is a bunch of these.
it's just, you can imagine just technology companies, right? Yeah, yeah. So, for example, like FinTech companies, HR, tech companies is a bunch of these.
11:32Okay, so that's not still fintech. You're still classified,
Okay, so that's not still fintech. You're still classified,
Okay, so that's not still fintech. You're still classified,
Okay, so that's not still fintech. You're still classified,
11:36yeah, yeah. That's right. Okay,
yeah, yeah. That's right. Okay,
yeah, yeah. That's right. Okay,
yeah, yeah. That's right. Okay,
11:41so that's that answers the first question.
so that's that answers the first question.
so that's that answers the first question.
so that's that answers the first question.
S Speaker 111:55Priyesh, did you have any question? Not at the moment? Yes. Coming in cold on this one.
Priyesh, did you have any question? Not at the moment? Yes. Coming in cold on this one.
Priyesh, did you have any question? Not at the moment? Yes. Coming in cold on this one.
Priyesh, did you have any question? Not at the moment? Yes. Coming in cold on this one.
12:08Okay, that's good.
S Speaker 112:11That answers my first question for now, since we have a follow up, we can time at a later
That answers my first question for now, since we have a follow up, we can time at a later
That answers my first question for now, since we have a follow up, we can time at a later
That answers my first question for now, since we have a follow up, we can time at a later
S Speaker 212:17point, just to close out the first question, Tushar, like, what I'll say is, even though this might be our entry point, like, customers automatically pull us into the second thing, third thing, and we expect from that market, sort of getting, like market creation standpoint, you know, as some of the applications almost become a little bit more mature, people are starting to invest more and more in sort of net new AI software, like, will be the thing that they turn to, because they're already using us. We're already hooked up into their, sort of into their data stack. So it becomes a very easy sort of way to say, Okay, let me now use refuel to pre process data, extract structure data, and feed my step back to databases. So starting from use cases where, you know, there's already dollar values we get in, and then we get in and then we sort of expand. So that becomes the motion here. So that was, I think, part one, I think part two of your question was almost a little bit of, how does this, how does this expand over time? Right? Look, I'll talk about roadmap a little bit here to chart, but then I'll pull back and talk about, like, at the end of the day, like, what is the, what is the net value that we're driving for customers? And like, why that is sort of like, end up being so big, right? Look, today, we have a platform that teams are using, building these sort of use cases on their own. It's custom, and it worked for them. They're scaling revenue, they're sort of scaling volume, and we're scaling revenue, but they're automatically pulling us into where their data sits. They're telling us like, Hey, can you connect to my snowflake? Run sort of these transformation directly in my snowflake or directly on my s3 so that sort of like is the and you can imagine that these companies, which are data stores, are going to be good friends of ours in the long term. So if you think about sort of like where we build sort of channel partnership. In the long term, we want to be driving a lot of data activity direct close to where data already sits those folks. And so channel partners become friends. We drive compute customers win, right? So that ends up being sort of like some lens into how we might go in the future. And then you can imagine that as we see these customers use more use cases. There are certain types of data transformations that end up being very common. So we end up building like a catalog of known transformations. It could be things like cleaning addresses, parsing job descriptions, parsing receipts, right? These become like standard things that are pre built, available in refuel, where an engineer just goes in, picks the correct one, connects their data and program. Two minutes in, they start using this. So that is a becoming a path of like, okay, you don't even have to spend the two days of engineering time. You just have like, two minutes and you're ready to get started. And look the final end goal. Here is a lot of this data transformation like you won't even be done by like humans on the team anymore. Like it'll be done sort of automatically as data is coming in, like we'll have when I don't want to use for agents, but the agents that are sort of monitoring this data, traffic, categorizing them, cleaning them, structuring this data better. So now, when we pull back from this, and this is sort of like the future that we want to get to when we pull back from this, you can imagine this, there's just so much like data processing and data activity that we're going to be doing for on behalf of our customers. The value that they see is like, you know, every single atomic unit of data transformation that is happening, right? Whether it's data that is getting clean, it's getting structured. Who does this today? Right? Frankly, it's like, you know, teams have to hire large data engineering teams, machine engineering teams, to go and solve these problems. And, you know, in a in some ways, right? The thing that we're doing for them automatically is not having to hire those massive teams, just having data always be ready, always be present. And that, you know, is that's like, you know, that's kind of like the thing eventually that we ended up replacing for them. Replacing is not even the right word. It's just like, there's so much more that they could be doing. They can't even hire. There's not enough machine learning people in the world. So the value ends up just being like this, you know, just massive amounts of just data transformation that is happening and just delivering business outcomes at the end. But
point, just to close out the first question, Tushar, like, what I'll say is, even though this might be our entry point, like, customers automatically pull us into the second thing, third thing, and we expect from that market, sort of getting, like market creation standpoint, you know, as some of the applications almost become a little bit more mature, people are starting to invest more and more in sort of net new AI software, like, will be the thing that they turn to, because they're already using us. We're already hooked up into their, sort of into their data stack. So it becomes a very easy sort of way to say, Okay, let me now use refuel to pre process data, extract structure data, and feed my step back to databases. So starting from use cases where, you know, there's already dollar values we get in, and then we get in and then we sort of expand. So that becomes the motion here. So that was, I think, part one, I think part two of your question was almost a little bit of, how does this, how does this expand over time? Right? Look, I'll talk about roadmap a little bit here to chart, but then I'll pull back and talk about, like, at the end of the day, like, what is the, what is the net value that we're driving for customers? And like, why that is sort of like, end up being so big, right? Look, today, we have a platform that teams are using, building these sort of use cases on their own. It's custom, and it worked for them. They're scaling revenue, they're sort of scaling volume, and we're scaling revenue, but they're automatically pulling us into where their data sits. They're telling us like, Hey, can you connect to my snowflake? Run sort of these transformation directly in my snowflake or directly on my s3 so that sort of like is the and you can imagine that these companies, which are data stores, are going to be good friends of ours in the long term. So if you think about sort of like where we build sort of channel partnership. In the long term, we want to be driving a lot of data activity direct close to where data already sits those folks. And so channel partners become friends. We drive compute customers win, right? So that ends up being sort of like some lens into how we might go in the future. And then you can imagine that as we see these customers use more use cases. There are certain types of data transformations that end up being very common. So we end up building like a catalog of known transformations. It could be things like cleaning addresses, parsing job descriptions, parsing receipts, right? These become like standard things that are pre built, available in refuel, where an engineer just goes in, picks the correct one, connects their data and program. Two minutes in, they start using this. So that is a becoming a path of like, okay, you don't even have to spend the two days of engineering time. You just have like, two minutes and you're ready to get started. And look the final end goal. Here is a lot of this data transformation like you won't even be done by like humans on the team anymore. Like it'll be done sort of automatically as data is coming in, like we'll have when I don't want to use for agents, but the agents that are sort of monitoring this data, traffic, categorizing them, cleaning them, structuring this data better.

16:36yeah, I guess. How would you
yeah, I guess. How would you
yeah, I guess. How would you
yeah, I guess. How would you
S Speaker 116:39like if you were to tell me, like, give me some examples of what, like this, for this agentic transformation, what

16:46is it that they would need, that
is it that they would need, that
is it that they would need, that
is it that they would need, that
S Speaker 116:49that you would specifically be able to solve? Like with your tooling? Like, let's take pick examples, right? Like with agentic workflows, like we can agentic workflows are essentially being able to agents, being able to, you know, think and act on your behalf, right? Yeah, we could also tackle that. I know you have to go in seven minutes. Why don't we tackle that part of the question later? Yeah. And then, for now, what I need to understand is this, the
that you would specifically be able to solve? Like with your tooling? Like, let's take pick examples, right?

S Speaker 217:36Yeah, maybe just to we'll we can touch touch on, sort of the sort of long term, sort of what we're end up doing, maybe in a later point. But, yeah, I think maybe just one way to think about like, at least, like, there's so many dollars here, Tushar, like, if you just look at like, how much snowflake is investing in, sort of doing data transformation, how much data bricks is investing, instead of being able to do this net new data transformation. The, yeah, there's just so many dollars and but we should, we should spend a little bit of time. I would like to
Yeah, maybe just to we'll we can touch touch on, sort of the sort of long term, sort of what we're end up doing, maybe in a later point. But, yeah, I think maybe just one way to think about like, at least, like, there's so many dollars here, Tushar, like, if you just look at like, how much snowflake is investing in, sort of doing data transformation, how much data bricks is investing, instead of being able to do this net new data transformation.

The, yeah, there's just so many dollars and but we should, we should spend a little bit of time. I would like to
S Speaker 120:18so, then the next level of abstraction for the what is it that specifically that like, besides, so, so if refining data was all about thumbs up, thumbs down, yeah, based on that, you do some sort of sort of set of steps to in order to curate that data better, yeah, beyond that. Now what? What does that include,
so, then the next level of abstraction for the what is it that specifically that like, besides, so, so if refining data was all about thumbs up, thumbs down, yeah, based on that, you do some sort of sort of set of steps to in order to curate that data better, yeah, beyond that.

Now what? What does that include,
S Speaker 220:40yeah, but beyond that, at this point, it includes like this workflow definition piece, which is like solving the full one place before you didn't even have the workload. No, because we were talking to imagine a machine learning engineer who cares about a very specific piece of the problem, right? They care about one ML model call, right? And they want to make sure that that is the highest accuracy possible. Whereas now the things that people build with refill, it's like it could have five LLM calls and it could include three API calls externally, right? And it's all sort of like deployed as a pipeline that is reading from snowflake and writing to snowflake. That's the final thing that gets done. But earlier, it was just everything around one LLM call or an ML model call, interesting,
yeah, but beyond that, at this point, it includes like this workflow definition piece, which is like solving the full one place before you didn't even have the workload. No, because we were talking to imagine a machine learning engineer who cares about a very specific piece of the problem, right? They care about one ML model call, right?

21:28and then, before, I'm

21:34We didn't do that. Yeah, that's
We didn't do that. Yeah, that's
We didn't do that. Yeah, that's
We didn't do that. Yeah, that's
S Speaker 121:36right part, right? Yeah, okay. And you
right part, right? Yeah, okay. And you
right part, right? Yeah, okay. And you
right part, right? Yeah, okay. And you
S Speaker 221:40can imagine, like, you know, the deploy part. You know, this is one, the deploy piece is one of those where we want, we want friends in the ecosystem right to shard like, we want to be making sure that, you know, from both the customer choice perspective, like customers have very specific needs, we want to make sure that they are being satisfied. But also we want to make sure that, you know, friends in the ecosystem, who have hungry sales teams, right? We can be good partners to them, so that we can eventually, right? So, like, think of them as channel partners. And if you imagine, like all of these inference providers, right, that just want high quality models to be available so that they can sort of run compute, they could be good friends. And you then imagine, sort of snowflake, and data breaks, right, it's easier for them to sell sort of like sell refill to their end customers if the final end point that is producing some compute is deployed in their ecosystem. So we'll make all those things possible for them. And as you know, everybody wins right in that sort of partnership.
can imagine, like, you know, the deploy part. You know, this is one, the deploy piece is one of those where we want, we want friends in the ecosystem right to shard like, we want to be making sure that, you know, from both the customer choice perspective, like customers have very specific needs, we want to make sure that they are being satisfied.
