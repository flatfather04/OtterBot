can you look up under how much we funded? But you can look at prepare. We don't have to wait. Bottom line is that we're going to try to pick up the asset. Okay, so I think that's it on. Let's see how good my memory is 600k 600 k1,

So, so I think that's it on the funding of the it's then portfolio key decisions from my side, I we can do pi five. First is a quick one. So I buy, I sent out updates. Some people would be I was my first board meeting last week after Carlos left. And then, essentially, in that board meeting, they say we're running out of cash in five weeks. So, and that was like, and then, and then, I just trying to see if they had notified the other board members before. So no, they didn't even tell the other board members, and then they say, Oh, by the way, our ARR was 7.3 but zapka renegotiated a deal, so our ARR is six. I went back and looked at the notes from Carlos when we were doing the follow on, it was already 7.4 then. So that means there was a lot of and then they were posturing that these two investors, smash cat and mitral are about to the internship. I met them and ces as well. He was saying the same thing. And then the posture was the railing 100 million dollar. And then it was clear to me that mental setup, at least, from what I could read, they would not say this. So this is I really smell like lot of foul play on the on the founders side here. So now we're in a position where, remember they launched with that Intuit dome.

Speaker 3
So they really have to make a decision pretty soon. The insiders were all anger tapped out. So the question is, do we? Are they able to get any new investors or 510, whatever, and that will be structured as an extension. So if it's an extension, then probably we don't have to do anything. And or if they're able to get this 10 million or $8 million whatever it is from Intuit dome to as prepayment to continue. If not, then this is going to we'll see what the inside, I think others are saying. We've got about 10 again. I think 5.56

in it. Yeah, we did more in the last I yeah
in it. Yeah, we did more in the last I yeah
Speaker 3
in the and that was just October, yeah, so, so. So, I think, I think my read on that is these guys were misrepresented, like Steve Carlin, that guy and I. He was misrepresented, and then so he just how many years old they do have data on the company. They have to even less
in the and that was just October, yeah, so, so. So, I think, I think my read on that is these guys were misrepresented, like Steve Carlin, that guy and I. He was misrepresented, and then so he just how many years old they do have data on the company. They have to even less

runway. Yes, yes,
oh, yeah. So how much data they have
oh, yeah. So how much data they have
oh, yeah. So how much data they have
oh, yeah. So how much data they have
Speaker 3
is all bad news,

Speaker 2
Speaker 3
I'll be quick on this part, so they trip the covenant. They essentially at this point, the situation is that they nearly $3 billion in equity from investors before they can draw from that. At the same time, he's also reducing so their burn is 500k per month right now, Zach is also reducing the burn to less than 200k

Speaker 3
That's the plan. But however, we need to make a decision. So we're got about $18.8 million in K of that is from the last convertible amount at University of prep and then so currently. So this is evolving. So just like about an hour ago, we texted me something else, so which is worse for us, but just so the current investor commitment he had told me on Friday was 1.5 million from three investors structuring it as a pay to play note with 2x but company financials, yeah, they've been growing and everything, but as we all know, that the company has not been able to scale fast enough. So there's no appetite from external investors to come into where 21 million Arr, and it's improved over the years. If you take a look at it, from a pure hardware company into your ARR company now, but from external so the solution that they're proposing. So this is one solution, and then the other one, which I'm really mad at, which I'll show next you just sent me to edit that is was structured as a $3 million note. Who has, like, our arm

now you look at the top three history and the top three investors, yeah,
Speaker 3
that's, that's pretty much, that's pretty much, oh, that I agree yes, yes. I thought it, yes, that I agree with. I saw that. And that's exactly what he's trying to do with just the top three entry, so which is easy to think of work on himself, yes, so I'm going to talk to him and figure this out. So we have to make a decision during the week and an email. So if we have
that's, that's pretty much, that's pretty much, oh, that I agree yes, yes. I thought it, yes, that I agree with. I saw that.

Yes, Matt and media,
Speaker 1
so, so, so they're like, I throw questions at them. You know, the challenges on the GPU side is running as they may open. So somewhat, some part of it. Right on the CPU side, there's a lot of cloud workload optimization, like Kubernetes guys there, just to see there, how they react to it. They kind of gave me some kind of party line answers without whole other specifics. Then I asked them, have they looked at the cast AI? And they said, Yeah, we look at, like, two years ago, and what is this quantum case is completely different than the company today. So it doesn't feel like the p7 guys had really good handle on the whole market. Yeah,
so, so, so they're like, I throw questions at them. You know, the challenges on the GPU side is running as they may open. So somewhat, some part of it.

Right on the CPU side, there's a lot of cloud workload optimization, like Kubernetes guys there, just to see there, how they react to it. They kind of gave me some kind of party line answers without whole other specifics. Then I asked them, have they looked at the cast AI? And they said, Yeah, we look at, like, two years ago, and what is this quantum case is completely different than the company today. So it doesn't feel like the p7 guys had really good handle on the whole market. Yeah,
so, so, so they're like, I throw questions at them. You know, the challenges on the GPU side is running as they may open. So somewhat, some part of it.

That's fine. The night change, right now, what is his view on like this, different, 20 different things. What can they monetize on this? You ask me, I

board? He is? Yeah, that's fine. So we'll see what he get back. Then I talked to Qualcomm it they are evaluating Casa AI, and this is the infrastructure team, right? So they said this insurance team, right? Yeah. So they said they are looking at Access Stella from the infrastructure side, from a different perspective, more EDA workup and HPC workload, and for the smaller Kubernetes workload, they were kind of CAS AI. And they also said, CAS AI, selling them on this live container workload migration capability. They said, Oh, this is, this is something that really interesting. They were banking on it.

It's nothing, so, so, but, but they also point out, you know, they had to see how real this is, any limitations. And also, case I told them straight up from they can't handle PDA and HPC workloads.

asked Yes. We asked Yeah. So they didn't give a definitive answer on it, on the COVID. That was actually an interesting call with Cassie hang and maybe visit your physician. Company away from this call, cost optimization market that's only part of it. But we sell all these big accounts based on Kubernetes security and based on our DevOp platform orchestration capability, they get, like completely moving the company narrative to very different space.

It was a it was more devsecops right versus cloud optimization. I think they tried to reposition from moving away from cloud to doing a lot more DevOps stuff.

Speaker 1
So, so, so I got back to xo style, and I said, Hey, I need two guys to give me a clear side by side comparison against all these other guys who claim COVID 19 container workflow optimization, and tell me what exactly is the incremental benefit you can add on top of it? Right? So they basically come back and clarify and say, All these R guys, except for CAS AI, they're using commenter the open source project. They have some workload on the migration capabilities, but it's not 100% for all applying to all the state for applications only specific one, specifically on the one with using MongoDB, because MongoDB has this database replication capability. So if you migration fails at the container level, MongoDB will come in here and take care, because they have this replication capability. But if you don't use MongoDB, and if it gets a little larger and just doesn't work. And they said, even for so cast AI, similar story, and they said carpenter is actually eating CAS AI lunch. So they said they met a lot of companies at AWS, reinvent people actually pointing out cast AI approach is a proprietary one carbon theory one is one against all structure now, even COVID. Has limitation. Test AI is more limitation. And as if you go into CAS AI dashboard, they start with the feedback perspective. Say, Hey, here's how much you can potentially save, and here are the workloads you can potentially move. We recommend you don't touch these other workloads, because it's not similar. So so we have to see, I try to say, show me some real data, right? You run against commenter, because that's open source, public available. Run some real workload. Show me the incremental side by side and on top of it, like, if you can show really good data. And let me take that to empty, right, to see if they buy the story, embedded by the story. Maybe, you know, Echo Stella is a more attractive one if they don't buy and then that would be probably, yeah, so, so they try to push I said, Hey, I really can't just rush a decision here. I really get at the bottom please. So we'll see. So they promised to get back to me with some real benchmark data by Wednesday,
So, so, so I got back to xo style, and I said, Hey, I need two guys to give me a clear side by side comparison against all these other guys who claim COVID 19 container workflow optimization, and tell me what exactly is the incremental benefit you can add on top of it?

on the numbers, they did 20 million ARL last year, yeah, and they're projecting 50, okay, and, but, but as you go on, the story just kind of like, impose deeper than I would just figure, like, why they're shooting the story right? Yeah, yeah, like this,

detail? Yeah, they have. Yeah, they had a product roadmap. But, you know, I remember talking to them at reinvent, the pitch completely changed from reinvent till now. So I think they were trying to figure out for CDC how they should position the company. I think they one thing that has happened for cast, AI, they were a SMB play, and they've been able to move to enterprises. So they double their ACV last three quarters, right? So they are saying they want to go larger accounts, but there's no defensibility in the tech, so that's why they're going broad. They're actually doing live migration as well. They'll be launching it in the second half of 2025 something similar to what existent would do, but, but, yeah, it's a, it's interesting enough, but not

yeah, so I'll have clarity on Wednesday whether he's actually doing a first close or not.

I think we had one meeting this morning with Quinn and the compliance folks. So that one is still work in progress. They will let us know, end of, like, middle of this week, whether we can actually spend time on this deal or not. Yeah.

so we did a switch study, and we can actually do that presentation separately, but for a time, new product fits in that. I'll give a quick overview about that as well. You all know this team because Quinn invested in them at inovium, Rajiv. Rajiv is very well known from the innovian time. I have had time to spend with baroon and Patrick last year over multiple interactions as we talked about interconnects, and very impressed by by baroon the new the new name that's not in here is they now also hired a key guy from Marvel who was in Rajesh, in OBM team, I found out about that today. So pretty strong team. Also really great execution. They took a one silicon to production, and so in three years i. Have delivered 75 million of revenue since the company started. They are here five minutes from us, about 80 full time employees. The financing they raised to date is about 160 5 million from celestial Mayfield, etc. They currently have a term sheet from step stone ventures, whom I don't know a lot, but they are in lp in funds. Tushar may have some visibility into them, and they are leading the 120 5 million round at 700 pre money valuation. And the compliance discussion is about investment from our board member Mark, who has an ownership in the company.

This is a quick summary of their blockchain product, which is really the key revenue driver for them. They are a four and three nanometer node, pretty high end on both Samsung and TSMC, custom ASIC. So this is what the box looks like from them. It's a custom ASICs in four different cooling technologies that's quite impressive, both air cooled, hydro cooled, as well as immersion cooling. So this is the box that they ship out to their customers. Their asps is around $5,000 and so they have shipped around 15,000 units last year, the market is quite large, obviously dominated by the Chinese, Chinese guys to date. So our time has very, very small opportunity to date, small camp in here, but a very large market. The new product that is interesting is for Qualcomm would be the AI product, which is the ultra USC, which is the scale up switch used to counter the NVIDIA product. And I'll talk a little bit about how that works. So this is the if you look at data center, what are the different question, one

What I want to see is is, is this regulation against Bitcoin that's driving the demand for which regulation, and we know can change, that's driving the demand for the Bitcoin mining product, or do they have a better product than Bitcoin? Yeah, so

the way he's and we'll have to spend time on it, and maybe Quinn has some visibility from last year, according to him, their product roadmap and the product they are shipping is superior on price performance and power, we need to validate that, compared to Bitcoin

better, right? It still wasn't fully mature at the time. So that kind of the POS going to interview is that they can kind of scale up and hit commercial scale and quantities is better. It still only serves kind of the more proportion, I think, is the just like the liquid gold part of the market, that's not the entire market, right? That doesn't go after a lot of the stuff that main does for the pools and consumers, yeah, and all that other I think, as well.

so the new switch, just to give a quick glimpse on where it fits, this is a typical data center. You have a core switch at the top spine, a leaf switch, top of the rack switch, and then you have a whole bunch of PCIe switches. Now, the core spine, the top of the sorry, the the leaf pieces. This is pretty mature market. This is Cisco, Arista, HP, etc. So this is not the area of focus. The area of focus is the PCIe switch. And how do you ensure scale up in GPU clusters, given limitations we have in PC PCRE switch, this market is around 5.2 billion and growing at a much higher CAGR than the top of the rack switch market. Again, Broadcom Marvel are still strong players here, AIC, 100 ships with microchip. That's the vendor that we use. So that's the key problem here, the. Speed as well as throughput. Requirement of PCI is not sufficient for what is required now. So there are three approaches in the market. There is a proprietary approach from Nvidia. Then there is a new standard approach called UI link, and then the third approach we saw was from companies like and fabrica, which is a super NIC approach. So we'll quickly describe those three and the opportunity here would be to partner with AIC going forward. This is the

So we, we took the lead cooling guy last Friday to auradine, and I just came back from auradine with the UL lead from AIC. Because of our meeting changer, I didn't get a chance to regroup with them. So, so they spend time with both of them, the cooling lead, optical lead, Ravi, that you you're aware of. And then Ramesh leads the ual switch activity.

Speaker 5
okay, yeah, so Quinn Tushar suggested to work on the strategic link in parallel to the compliance link that's going on. Hence, some of this, some of this effort. So this is how the URL link will work. That you know, you will have GPU clusters that will be connected that can go to at least 72 and above. And then they will scale out through a tri Ethernet. That's, that's how the composition will be. And they can go up to 200 gigabit per second per lane. That's the next level target from 112 that we have today. And we can, we can do a detail switch overview. There was a big document that I sent. This is just a quick summary. So there were three notable startups here. Xcon is a startup that started in as a CXL and PCIe switch, and now it's doing UL. Their investor base is currently from from Asia. They're based here. They're also close to our our building. They are shipping, so from a product standpoint, they're shipping CX L and PCI switch, predominantly competing with.com and they have advantages in terms of number, of course, cost, etc. And they will do a UL tape out. I believe they will probably be sometime, sometime around next year. And Fabric is a slightly different approach. Started with the fence and do like approach, of course, coming in with a super Nic, and so now they will also do a ual. The notable thing about end fabrica is Sutter Hill is a great investor in this space. Really broad portfolio of companies take very incubation like approach. So they're involved with the end fabrica has very strong financial backing, just like or a dime, but pretty well set up the tape out for the super NIC happened in 2024 and we have potential and opportunity here as well. The key points here are one and engagement with AIC, which I think should happen in the next couple of weeks, and then we'll go through some of the diligence on them. They are free products, though, you know, although the tape out is has happened as of December. And the third approach are companies like aurodyne, which is, you know, coming at it purely from from a URL standpoint. So my analysis was, and fabrica and aurodyne are good, good ones to. To look into as potential investments. I don't yet have 100% conviction in ex con for multiple reasons.
okay, yeah, so Quinn Tushar suggested to work on the strategic link in parallel to the compliance link that's going on. Hence, some of this, some of this effort.

The key points here are one and engagement with AIC, which I think should happen in the next couple of weeks, and then we'll go through some of the diligence on them. They are free products, though, you know, although the tape out is has happened as of December. And the third approach are companies like aurodyne, which is, you know, coming at it purely from from a URL standpoint. So my analysis was, and fabrica and aurodyne are good, good ones to. To look into as potential investments. I don't yet have 100% conviction in ex con for multiple reasons.
okay, yeah, so Quinn Tushar suggested to work on the strategic link in parallel to the compliance link that's going on. Hence, some of this, some of this effort. So this is how the URL link will work. That you know, you will have GPU clusters that will be connected that can go to at least 72 and above. And then they will scale out through a tri Ethernet. That's, that's how the composition will be. And they can go up to 200 gigabit per second per lane. That's the next level target from 112 that we have today. And we can, we can do a detail switch overview. There was a big document that I sent. This is just a quick summary. So there were three notable startups here. Xcon is a startup that started in as a CXL and PCIe switch, and now it's doing UL. Their investor base is currently from from Asia. They're based here. They're also close to our our building. They are shipping, so from a product standpoint, they're shipping CX L and PCI switch, predominantly competing with.com and they have advantages in terms of number, of course, cost, etc. And they will do a UL tape out. I believe they will probably be sometime, sometime around next year. And Fabric is a slightly different approach. Started with the fence and do like approach, of course, coming in with a super Nic, and so now they will also do a ual.

you know, completely competing with Broadcom, and so I need to get comfort on how that roadmap will be, astera did well competing with Broadcom. So that's not to take away that particular competitive angle, but I just need to spend more time to see the Broadcom competition. Second, their investor base is all from Asia as well. So we need to that doesn't fit the QCD filter in terms of having a strong financial need. So those are the two open areas on XCOM.

Broadcom is doing UEC, which is the so, you know, these guys also compete with Broadcom for the PCIe switch today that you ship today. So Broadcom got out of UL. Broadcom is doing UEC.

correct. That's correct. So Broadcom was in it, but they believe that they UEC will be the way to go, and so we are spending more time on it to see how UEC will compare to ual. UEC is the as we discuss. It goes on top here, and ual goes this way. There are some technical differences between UEC and UL. So UEC is sort of packet based. This is transaction based. The speed of UEC is supposed to be still about two to 3x slower than UL. So we've gone through the spec to see the differences between the two, but we'll get one more informed view of how Broadcom will play if it is only UVC.

I think they're building their chips the URL. So the question
I think they're building their chips the URL. So the question

I think they're building their chips the URL. So the question
Speaker 2
is, like, if media has a lock on this data center stuff, right, can the URL stuff actually get any tracking? That's the

That's the hard question, but that's that'll be very hard, that'll
That's the hard question, but that's that'll be very hard, that'll
Speaker 3
be very hard to answer. But I think the question is, which one we have to figure out in all the other new ones, which one is the rest of the hyperscalers and Broadcom and everybody else is most excited where the next set of billions of dollars they all try, at least these companies will be able to sell, whether or not eventually become successful. That's a

market. Yeah, in opium was going after Broadcom, still competing with Broadcom. Very tough thing to do, but the market was there. They just have to make a differentiator product, right? So the market is there smart next, and they have to create the market, create the market, and the timing becomes a big factor. Yeah, yeah, when this thing happens or not,

Speaker 3
look at the market and it may even not happen as possible, see the thing is, the market or networking and data center exists and scale up. Scale up. The question is, you can Google another proprietor. So if you want to build another product for it, the market exists for that product. The question is, you know, there's a bunch of different approaches. Are they better when they intersect. It's the same version with AI as six, right? When they intersect the market with GPUs, how is their performance going to be?

it's very hard, like Bluetooth or HD,

yeah, we have to believe the market outside.
yeah, we have to believe the market outside.
yeah, we have to believe the market outside.
yeah, we have to believe the market outside.
Speaker 3
And then we come back to this in the meeting when you set up. All right, okay, so I'll discuss this, and then this will again. I think we probably have a longer, separate session on AI agents and how we should take a look at AI agents in general. I'll talk about this one company crew, AI, I've been talking to them. We had a lot of meeting just before this one with AI, but before this I put together this table Bucha. We were looking at many of these AI agent company, which is, it's a mix of so all these AI agents is, in summary, what is an AI agent? It's an AI right now, as it stands, an AI agent is to is a piece of AI software that automates enterprise or consumer workflows. We saw open AI launch operator two days ago that is also a form of consumer AI agent that is browser based. Then we have a bunch of these different AI agents, and I'll talk through this. I think the framework that I thought would be easy to put together for now would be more around horizontal agents and more domain specific agents, horizontal agents. There's again, two types over there. One is these large general purpose agent systems, so open AI building agent models. And in that case, what they doing with open AI is, I mean, the reason why I separated those is because these are companies with billions of dollars that they embraced, they own their models as well, and their building agent takes systems on top. So the question is, where do you ideally, what you don't want to play or for as a new startup? In many of those places where open AI anthropic or x ai hasn't released AI agents yet, but I the news the rumors out there working on agenting systems as well. The second category over there is more horizontal, which is companies that are building agent frameworks and Agent templates that you can use APIs that you can use for building a call center, agent you can at the same time, you can use APIs for document processing. At the same time, you can use AI, Agent of legal assistant, and all of those, right? So there's several companies in that. There was one other company that we looked at last month, RCA, I in similar horizontal space, who AI is in that same. Is crew AI. Now this is a company, again, that has built large developer communities. So most of these agent framework or horizontal ones, they typically go with an open source product. Initially build developer communities, and then they use that to get enterprise adoption. That's the nature of these. So and so we've seen land change. The land chain also creates land graph, which is an agent in London index outside, or an auto Gen AI. And these are more horizontal plays in all of these for agents, at least right now, the company that everybody talks about is this company, crew, AI. They have hundreds of 1000s of developers. We just spoke with them, what they call cruise, cruise, into the group of agents that are executing together. So this month, they'll have 20 million crews that will execute on that platform. So, so this is a company that has the most traction in terms of the number of developers. We don't know the revenues he was talking on the call before you see the same bunch of six figure deals. So we don't know what that means. This company actually started in Brazil, so I sent it to Stephanie. Remember, she's still there. She left. Okay. So sent it to Stephanie last year, because he started in Sao Paulo, and then the founder just moved here, so Stephanie's not like Goa as otherwise. So last year, I think Stephanie tried to reach out to him, but he didn't respond. So what word was, Nicole sent this email that he wants to go work with crew. So I used that to get him to talk to us, and then we now he's interested. So they're raising around they're going to be raising. So that's not really just a race. When they announced that rounds, we say, announced that around that round was racist about so but, but now they're getting preempted. So they already getting preempted. In general, I think we can talk about one more detail. There's a lot of vertical specific the one that is really working very well. Everybody's talking about this cursor, which is coding agents. There's many, many companies, actually, they're vertical.
And then we come back to this in the meeting when you set up. All right, okay, so I'll discuss this, and then this will again. I think we probably have a longer, separate session on AI agents and how we should take a look at AI agents in general. I'll talk about this one company crew, AI, I've been talking to them. We had a lot of meeting just before this one with AI, but before this I put together this table Bucha. We were looking at many of these AI agent company, which is, it's a mix of so all these AI agents is, in summary, what is an AI agent? It's an AI right now, as it stands, an AI agent is to is a piece of AI software that automates enterprise or consumer workflows. We saw open AI launch operator two days ago that is also a form of consumer AI agent that is browser based. Then we have a bunch of these different AI agents, and I'll talk through this. I think the framework that I thought would be easy to put together for now would be more around horizontal agents and more domain specific agents, horizontal agents. There's again, two types over there. One is these large general purpose agent systems, so open AI building agent models. And in that case, what they doing with open AI is, I mean, the reason why I separated those is because these are companies with billions of dollars that they embraced, they own their models as well, and their building agent takes systems on top. So the question is, where do you ideally, what you don't want to play or for as a new startup? In many of those places where open AI anthropic or x ai hasn't released AI agents yet, but I the news the rumors out there working on agenting systems as well. The second category over there is more horizontal, which is companies that are building agent frameworks and Agent templates that you can use APIs that you can use for building a call center, agent you can at the same time, you can use APIs for document processing. At the same time, you can use AI, Agent of legal assistant, and all of those, right? So there's several companies in that. There was one other company that we looked at last month, RCA, I in similar horizontal space, who AI is in that same. Is crew AI. Now this is a company, again, that has built large developer communities. So most of these agent framework or horizontal ones, they typically go with an open source product. Initially build developer communities, and then they use that to get enterprise adoption. That's the nature of these. So and so we've seen land change. The land chain also creates land graph, which is an agent in London index outside, or an auto Gen AI. And these are more horizontal plays in all of these for agents, at least right now, the company that everybody talks about is this company, crew, AI. They have hundreds of 1000s of developers. We just spoke with them, what they call cruise, cruise, into the group of agents that are executing together. So this month, they'll have 20 million crews that will execute on that platform. So, so this is a company that has the most traction in terms of the number of developers. We don't know the revenues he was talking on the call before you see the same bunch of six figure deals. So we don't know what that means. This company actually started in Brazil, so I sent it to Stephanie. Remember, she's still there. She left. Okay. So sent it to Stephanie last year, because he started in Sao Paulo, and then the founder just moved here, so Stephanie's not like Goa as otherwise. So last year, I think Stephanie tried to reach out to him, but he didn't respond. So what word was, Nicole sent this email that he wants to go work with crew. So I used that to get him to talk to us, and then we now he's interested. So they're raising around they're going to be raising. So that's not really just a race. When they announced that rounds, we say, announced that around that round was racist about so but, but now they're getting preempted. So they already getting preempted. In general, I think we can talk about one more detail. There's a lot of vertical specific the one that is really working very well. Everybody's talking about this cursor, which is coding agents.

anyways, going back to like vertical is in right now what, at least, what I'm seeing is many vertical agent companies. They're scaling very valid values. So that's a definitely like cursor. Is one company that has done, of course, zero 100 million dollars. But there's several companies like Sierra, as we all know, is doing more than 30 or $40 million AR, Sierra, same spaces, each company also started. Party AI, the legal agent company. Party AI is also doing very, very well and so similarly. So in that vertical AI agent space, there's many companies that are so so right now I see that vertical, vertical AI engines a better space, better space for us to deploy dollars, because you can get more revenues, money, more value. So that's but let me quickly COVID lines

so I think then they have traction. But you know where. Level, because, because the the other thing, so, there's another company. I meant, I mentioned podium. Podium is also there. These companies are all getting 50 million in a matter of class.

let's I'll try to go quick. I just want to cover flocks a little bit, because we have the management call coming up, so I don't want to go in cold for flocks tomorrow. So let me just quickly talk about said, I this. This is a US deal. The founder is based in SF, and he's Indian. So. So, so they're, they're raising Series B, and just a quick refresher on I had covered this maybe a month and a half ago. It's an ex PayPal team. They build the similar infrastructure for PayPal, and then they spun off to start. Said, I what they do effectively is use reinforcement learning to optimize cloud, and it's not just focused on the cost aspect of it, it's also focused on the performance and the availability, right? So when it goes down and depending on the application, what is the performance of your cloud infrastructure? And they don't just do it for compute, but they also do it for storage and AI workloads. So if you can look at the environments they support, I mentioned it in the solution part. It's not just a Kubernetes focused single cloud play. They actually do it across clouds and even on prem so that's just Kubernetes, but they also do VMs across AWS and Azure. They also do storage and streaming, and they will be adding support for Databricks and snowflake, right? So from a technology standpoint, they have a broad coverage, which definitely is not something that I've seen across other players today. Their traction has been good over the last year. It's, of course, grown from a small base. So they were at 700k in 2023, I just had a call yesterday, and they will close this year at 3 million. Arr, right? And it's mostly large enterprises, which is what got me excited in the first place, like COVID network, GSK, geodes spending half a million dollars on this platform. It's a 90% gross margin business with good expansion. Palo Alto expanded from 50 to 350 K. Now the update here from last time is they have received a term sheet. So they raised 18.5 from Sierra and Norwest, both of the funds. We know, in fact, Matt is a co investor in multiple of our companies. They are raising 25 million term sheet is led by AXA at 85 million pre money, right? So that's a quick snapshot of what the company does. And so years, at least a quick overview of feedback, yes,

1:02:41
we were also talking I was going to reinvent and actually I ended up speaking with quite a few players there. We had four live opportunities at the same time, right? So we have cast AI, which probably will start the round the next, next week. Cloud zero got preempted in December. We don't have any allocation left. There they were at 25 million ARR fin out also closed the round. In fact, we are going to deploy fin out Boaz. This is an Israeli deal, and Boaz couldn't get allocation. So yeah, and so I didn't chase fin out, but I did talk to them at reinvent. So we have said, Said, I cast AI and Albert mentioned EXO stellar too, but I've talked to all of these companies, right? Prosper Ops is another one that's doing really well. They are at a 30, 40 million ENR, but they are not raising money. It's like a it's like a PE investment. They are profitable and not looking to raise money right now. The question

Speaker 4
1:06:16
no. So I specifically brought this up in the discussion, they don't see each other's competition. In fact, they jointly, sometimes target a customer. So what one thing I need to validate, still, that's why I'm talking to cast AI, is How deep are they going in the DevOps? Because I told you at reinvent DevOps was not in cast AI's pitch. It is specifically built for the CDC fundraise. And I was calling the I was calling the woodshed there. I told them, tell me what you have today, and what are you selling today, right? Don't talk to me about what you want to raise and what you want to do. But I'll come back to you on that, because cast AI, I know they don't have DevOps the depth of DevOps that they claim to be.
no. So I specifically brought this up in the discussion, they don't see each other's competition. In fact, they jointly, sometimes target a customer.

Speaker 4
1:07:21
So I can, I can, actually, there's a good segue to cast AI, right? So here's some of the key points here. There 55% of the business is us. They did 19.5 90 million last year. They're planning to do 50, which I think Albert also mentioned. One thing that caught my attention was they have low gross margins. 75% is a bit low. So there might be some services angle there that we need to double click on. And they are going into live migrations of containers and VMs in second half, right? So this was the last round valuation. They were already very big team. Yes, they have, like, I think, 202 20 people on their payroll today. And the last post was 300 million. This was probably they were doing it, you know, five, 6 million. Err, they were at 300 million valuation, right? So that's on cast, and the Just a last bit on said, AI, said, I so this is what I asked them to prepare for our team. I actually went through each of the customers and tried to understand, is it only a Kubernetes place, which is which is not the case. They are not just Kubernetes. They actually do serverless. They do VMs and they do containers as well. So for each of these large customers, they have a roadmap to expand into multiple of these environments, right? Which is what I like about them. If you look at GSK, which is a recent customer win, they're spending 750 K on the platform, and it's a VMs and Kubernetes, right? And expansion is going to happen in storage. So I like this story here because there is a clear path to expand beyond just Kubernetes, and there is value in the tech. It is defensible because it's using reinforcement learning to build that a lot of others are doing automation. So I will continue digging Quinn is I'm setting up a meeting with Quinn, with the founder this week so we'll get more updates, and I'll follow up next week with a more detailed discussion.

1:10:28
so Flox, let's
Speaker 4
1:10:29
Yeah, so I'll keep it quick. We have the management call tomorrow. I was looking to get more data points and validation. This is an earlier stage deal. Luckily, I reached out to spectro, and their head of open source has actually worked on Nix before. I also talked to the CTO Saad. He actually hasn't worked on Nix, but he was very interested. He's like, actually, this sounds very interesting. I want to join the call. So the head of open source feedback was, he's worked on it. He liked it, but it is very hard to use. It's a lot of work, right? So what he's saying is, once you build the dependencies and the tree, if you were to add something that's not in Nix, it takes a lot of work. It takes a lot of uplift lifting to do, to actually add to the Nix platform, so he hasn't deployed it as widely, and he didn't know much about phlox, so I was addressing that phlox is trying to solve and make Nix easier for people like you to deploy it, right? So he was definitely interested, but he was like, I don't know enough about phlox to know that. So he validated the name. That was point number one. The other thing they I somehow felt that they were trying to defend containers and Kubernetes. So the first 10 minutes was all about, you know, we can do all of what phlox does in a container. And I was like, Guys, I'm not trying to, you know, make a, like, a conservative case for spectro. You don't have to be defensive. But they kept saying, you know, it's not replacing containers or Kubernetes. So that was, that was the spectral clock call Tushar, and I talked to the lead investor edition. So they let the seed round in the company. The feedback that they had was a lot of their portfolio companies were using Nix, and they got these, these guys are champions within their own companies, who actually love Nix, and they were looking to invest in a company that can commercialize next. Right at that time, they didn't find any, and flocks came up through one of the Israeli seed seed funds. So it was a, is, it was a seed intro, intro that they got, and then they invested in the company. They usually don't do seed checks, but they really like this, and they were they say that they're really impressed by Ron because he's actually able to take on Nick's leadership and really command the roadmap there. So Ron sits on the board for next so that was something which was interesting. They said that they've talked to Nvidia, and Nvidia is a user today, so they were not a paying customer in December, but they are a paying customer today. But it's a small use case only the software team is using it. It's like a 2025, person team. Here are the negatives from the call, right? So the addition feedback was, guys, this is super early. They are probably six to 12 months before commercialization. But the only reason edition is doubling down is because they like what they see. They have these early validations, but they acknowledge that they don't have a path to revenues today. They have a pipeline. So he actually said it's six to 12 months before commercialization, right? So we have to go into the deal or the opportunity knowing this early stage and revenues will take six to 12 months to come in. And he called out some of the case studies that he knows, like Shopify is a big, big next shop. Microsoft is using it. Replit is using it. Hashicorps founder Michelle Hashimoto, is actually a big proponent of phlox. So there are, like, subjective validations. I don't have, like tangible data points, so I know Albert asked for Kubernetes versus Nix, right? So I asked the team to put something together, and here's how it compares, right? So if you look at Kubernetes on the left, they had some 415 450 pull requests compared to 7000 8000 pull requests. If you look at the contributors, it's like, it's almost like double, right? So Nick's has 5000
Yeah, so I'll keep it quick. We have the management call tomorrow. I was looking to get more data points and validation. This is an earlier stage deal. Luckily, I reached out to spectro, and their head of open source has actually worked on Nix before. I also talked to the CTO Saad. He actually hasn't worked on Nix, but he was very interested. He's like, actually, this sounds very interesting. I want to join the call. So the head of open source feedback was, he's worked on it. He liked it, but it is very hard to use.

Speaker 1
No COVID. If we get it, it's actually pretty good value, and because we can leverage that across our data. Philip, so last semester, we're probably not going to get anything other because the data stack is 70,
at least, we produce some value for the BU,
Speaker 2
yes, how much do we invest? Only five questions over there, right? One on
Speaker 1
one, I think we hold back on that, on the second one, following
that, you remember the
second one, you should know,
Speaker 2
can you look up under how much we funded? But you can look at prepare. We don't have to wait. Bottom line is that we're going to try to pick up the asset. Okay, so I think that's it on. Let's see how good my memory is 600k 600 k1,
memory. So I don't have outcomes.
I don't have a total notice.
Speaker 3
So, so I think that's it on the funding of the it's then portfolio key decisions from my side, I we can do pi five. First is a quick one. So I buy, I sent out updates. Some people would be I was my first board meeting last week after Carlos left. And then, essentially, in that board meeting, they say we're running out of cash in five weeks. So, and that was like, and then, and then, I just trying to see if they had notified the other board members before. So no, they didn't even tell the other board members, and then they say, Oh, by the way, our ARR was 7.3 but zapka renegotiated a deal, so our ARR is six. I went back and looked at the notes from Carlos when we were doing the follow on, it was already 7.4 then. So that means there was a lot of and then they were posturing that these two investors, smash cat and mitral are about to the internship. I met them and ces as well. He was saying the same thing. And then the posture was the railing 100 million dollar. And then it was clear to me that mental setup, at least, from what I could read, they would not say this. So this is I really smell like lot of foul play on the on the founders side here. So now we're in a position where, remember they launched with that Intuit dome.
I said, Why don't you go collect money from
Speaker 3
bombers? The bomber should, should be able to give you so so they're like, we're going to talk to him about 10 million prepay for three years, and that will allow the company to survive
for nine months and then to buy more time.
Speaker 3
So they really have to make a decision pretty soon. The insiders were all anger tapped out. So the question is, do we? Are they able to get any new investors or 510, whatever, and that will be structured as an extension. So if it's an extension, then probably we don't have to do anything. And or if they're able to get this 10 million or $8 million whatever it is from Intuit dome to as prepayment to continue. If not, then this is going to we'll see what the inside, I think others are saying. We've got about 10 again. I think 5.56
in it. Yeah, we did more in the last I yeah
Speaker 3
in the and that was just October, yeah, so, so. So, I think, I think my read on that is these guys were misrepresented, like Steve Carlin, that guy and I. He was misrepresented, and then so he just how many years old they do have data on the company. They have to even less
runway. Yes, yes,
oh, yeah. So how much data they have
Speaker 3
is all bad news,
Speaker 3
Speaker 2
Speaker 3
I'll be quick on this part, so they trip the covenant. They essentially at this point, the situation is that they nearly $3 billion in equity from investors before they can draw from that. At the same time, he's also reducing so their burn is 500k per month right now, Zach is also reducing the burn to less than 200k
in two weeks.
Speaker 3
That's the plan. But however, we need to make a decision. So we're got about $18.8 million in K of that is from the last convertible amount at University of prep and then so currently. So this is evolving. So just like about an hour ago, we texted me something else, so which is worse for us, but just so the current investor commitment he had told me on Friday was 1.5 million from three investors structuring it as a pay to play note with 2x but company financials, yeah, they've been growing and everything, but as we all know, that the company has not been able to scale fast enough. So there's no appetite from external investors to come into where 21 million Arr, and it's improved over the years. If you take a look at it, from a pure hardware company into your ARR company now, but from external so the solution that they're proposing. So this is one solution, and then the other one, which I'm really mad at, which I'll show next you just sent me to edit that is was structured as a $3 million note. Who has, like, our arm
Corona would have been 257, or 450, 7k
Speaker 3
to work for you if I get converted to common.
Speaker 3
So this is, this is where it stands right now. They have to make a decision by Friday. So I'm negotiating, so hopefully we can get back to 457, okay,
Speaker 2
this is based on what's invested capital, which is similar, right?
Speaker 3
Speaker 2
Yeah, you know what happens? They increased to 5 million. That's the
Speaker 3
difference. No. So that's one entry. That's the one we can introduce it to three, which I'm going to ask. That's the that's the thing. So that's the big, yeah, so we can ask him to reduce it for three. Yes, I bet you he's also playing games that I
Speaker 1
think what they try to do is they know they're not going to get five. They try to hit three, yes, with this number, yes, it's possible.
Speaker 3
It's possible. But Zach is also so I think he's also thank you right now, because we're not talking to the investors, because
Speaker 1
now you look at the top three history and the top three investors, yeah,
Speaker 3
that's, that's pretty much, that's pretty much, oh, that I agree yes, yes. I thought it, yes, that I agree with. I saw that. And that's exactly what he's trying to do with just the top three entry, so which is easy to think of work on himself, yes, so I'm going to talk to him and figure this out. So we have to make a decision during the week and an email. So if we have
Speaker 1
this priority, when line of sign to get acquired. We may not, may not want to object to this. So
there's no line
Speaker 3
some weeks before the North club is
Speaker 3
because he can draw from debt from bank. As soon as we get the Trump ship, they signed the Trump ship. So he just needs to find the Trump ship and let him speak. So let's say this is how much
they are showing this one. How much debt is on this one, 17.5 so this is kind of similar approaches, maybe not as bad
as Under the year.
Christmas presents for you from Congress. Yeah.
Anything surprised when I thought, particle is not a
surprise. That guy, I don't trust that guy, Steve,
Speaker 3
at least, was my first interaction with him. I didn't feel like I didn't trust him, yeah. Okay, so I think we can get to advanced prospects,
EXO, stellar and pop
idea, yeah. So just quickly.
Speaker 1
So I talked to solasta Steve, who is the last time he was actually surprised that there was change he didn't know yet find out what's going on the next day. I talked to p7 I think that took. Is under official team, so they work on that.
So I kind of raise questions.
Yes, Matt and media,
Speaker 1
so, so, so they're like, I throw questions at them. You know, the challenges on the GPU side is running as they may open. So somewhat, some part of it. Right on the CPU side, there's a lot of cloud workload optimization, like Kubernetes guys there, just to see there, how they react to it. They kind of gave me some kind of party line answers without whole other specifics. Then I asked them, have they looked at the cast AI? And they said, Yeah, we look at, like, two years ago, and what is this quantum case is completely different than the company today. So it doesn't feel like the p7 guys had really good handle on the whole market. Yeah,
Speaker 2
okay, it feels like, but what about Steve's because
he's gonna contact me.
Speaker 2
That's fine. The night change, right now, what is his view on like this, different, 20 different things. What can they monetize on this? You ask me, I
Speaker 1
asked him. He seemed to be mostly completely caught off guard, but it's LP, change, is it right? LP, change, AOP,
that's one thing. Forget that you were
just so surprised by the other questions.
Is he on the
Speaker 1
board? He is? Yeah, that's fine. So we'll see what he get back. Then I talked to Qualcomm it they are evaluating Casa AI, and this is the infrastructure team, right? So they said this insurance team, right? Yeah. So they said they are looking at Access Stella from the infrastructure side, from a different perspective, more EDA workup and HPC workload, and for the smaller Kubernetes workload, they were kind of CAS AI. And they also said, CAS AI, selling them on this live container workload migration capability. They said, Oh, this is, this is something that really interesting. They were banking on it.
Speaker 2
Cast, AI. Cast, AI, oh, same thing as this guy, nothing.
Speaker 1
It's nothing, so, so, but, but they also point out, you know, they had to see how real this is, any limitations. And also, case I told them straight up from they can't handle PDA and HPC workloads.
Then I am
on the call. And even
Speaker 1
asked Yes. We asked Yeah. So they didn't give a definitive answer on it, on the COVID. That was actually an interesting call with Cassie hang and maybe visit your physician. Company away from this call, cost optimization market that's only part of it. But we sell all these big accounts based on Kubernetes security and based on our DevOp platform orchestration capability, they get, like completely moving the company narrative to very different space.
Speaker 4
It was a it was more devsecops right versus cloud optimization. I think they tried to reposition from moving away from cloud to doing a lot more DevOps stuff.
Speaker 1
So, so, so I got back to xo style, and I said, Hey, I need two guys to give me a clear side by side comparison against all these other guys who claim COVID 19 container workflow optimization, and tell me what exactly is the incremental benefit you can add on top of it? Right? So they basically come back and clarify and say, All these R guys, except for CAS AI, they're using commenter the open source project. They have some workload on the migration capabilities, but it's not 100% for all applying to all the state for applications only specific one, specifically on the one with using MongoDB, because MongoDB has this database replication capability. So if you migration fails at the container level, MongoDB will come in here and take care, because they have this replication capability. But if you don't use MongoDB, and if it gets a little larger and just doesn't work. And they said, even for so cast AI, similar story, and they said carpenter is actually eating CAS AI lunch. So they said they met a lot of companies at AWS, reinvent people actually pointing out cast AI approach is a proprietary one carbon theory one is one against all structure now, even COVID. Has limitation. Test AI is more limitation. And as if you go into CAS AI dashboard, they start with the feedback perspective. Say, Hey, here's how much you can potentially save, and here are the workloads you can potentially move. We recommend you don't touch these other workloads, because it's not similar. So so we have to see, I try to say, show me some real data, right? You run against commenter, because that's open source, public available. Run some real workload. Show me the incremental side by side and on top of it, like, if you can show really good data. And let me take that to empty, right, to see if they buy the story, embedded by the story. Maybe, you know, Echo Stella is a more attractive one if they don't buy and then that would be probably, yeah, so, so they try to push I said, Hey, I really can't just rush a decision here. I really get at the bottom please. So we'll see. So they promised to get back to me with some real benchmark data by Wednesday,
then we should have better COVID.
Speaker 3
Okay, so we have, I guess, if we get the benchmark data then, but then, how long will that take? Then I can just quickly
throw all the fence to COVID 19,
whatever the outcome is, yeah, that's
good. Maybe this may
just need to figure out the messaging aspect.
Speaker 3
And then I think, I guess, because of the cryptocurrency we love to legacy. Some COVID too is based on maybe we need
to verify, but
before we get those
Speaker 2
cast, AI is it looks interesting at all or no? Interesting
Speaker 1
on the numbers, they did 20 million ARL last year, yeah, and they're projecting 50, okay, and, but, but as you go on, the story just kind of like, impose deeper than I would just figure, like, why they're shooting the story right? Yeah, yeah, like this,
Speaker 3
Speaker 4
detail? Yeah, they have. Yeah, they had a product roadmap. But, you know, I remember talking to them at reinvent, the pitch completely changed from reinvent till now. So I think they were trying to figure out for CDC how they should position the company. I think they one thing that has happened for cast, AI, they were a SMB play, and they've been able to move to enterprises. So they double their ACV last three quarters, right? So they are saying they want to go larger accounts, but there's no defensibility in the tech, so that's why they're going broad. They're actually doing live migration as well. They'll be launching it in the second half of 2025 something similar to what existent would do, but, but, yeah, it's a, it's interesting enough, but not
based on one call. It's hard to tell if it's, it's the winner
negotiated by Wednesday.
Oh, that topic came up,
Speaker 2
and then we can see was us, right in the East US. So they only have a development team in Europe. Or is it
Speaker 3
right? The CEO and the C suite entirely is in Miami. Yeah,
in the US, most of markets in the US, yeah,
Speaker 3
well, market is in us. Goa has its own arguments. They
Speaker 3
actually stopped in the argument is that I think my friends
like if that was so go figure
Speaker 2
out. Prior company was a US company. We invested from Israel team, so it didn't change, right?
Speaker 3
Prior company was also US company, yeah, we
Speaker 2
invested like, Yeah, you don't have a cologne or normal us. Oh, so that's like no argument. If
the guy hasn't gone back, then Alright, so, okay, thank
Speaker 1
you. A lot of the companies are Indian companies. Yeah,
Indian
companies not even born. Only meet
you. Okay, so I think that's good sorted out
by men's day, but it should be,
then how mighty should be? A quick update, right?
Speaker 5
Speaker 3
so. One is timeline for when do you think we should get approval live? And then the second is, I guess you're saying by the end of this week, we'll do the first close, and then the second close is up close,
Speaker 5
yeah, so I'll have clarity on Wednesday whether he's actually doing a first close or not. I have call with management on Wednesday, so we'll get clarity on that, and then we the second close is flexible for us to to do that, so we can work with our timeline for internal approvals as well as legal etc.
And check size 2 million.
Speaker 5
Check size currently is 2 million on Wednesday, I'll get that warrant clarification, but currently it's at 2 million.
And remember,
the deal is that happening? You know,
Speaker 5
yes, it is happening. I can ask
Speaker 2
into driving this like we need a we need to close this, otherwise we're having a
Speaker 3
bad Correct. Hence, our timeline is dependent on that. Correct. That's
correct. It will be the same as COVID. Um,
Speaker 3
I think that's it.
Prospects, we should do
our time first
Adam and Chris. Anything else do you guys know of missing on this module list? I think that probably not, right, not aware of anything else I don't know. Yeah, of course, nothing off the top of my head. Okay, thank you
Speaker 3
so prospects. Let's discuss our dying first portion. Okay,
Speaker 5
I think we had one meeting this morning with Quinn and the compliance folks. So that one is still work in progress. They will let us know, end of, like, middle of this week, whether we can actually spend time on this deal or not. Yeah.
But otherwise you had a Okay, yeah,
Speaker 5
so we did a switch study, and we can actually do that presentation separately, but for a time, new product fits in that. I'll give a quick overview about that as well. You all know this team because Quinn invested in them at inovium, Rajiv. Rajiv is very well known from the innovian time. I have had time to spend with baroon and Patrick last year over multiple interactions as we talked about interconnects, and very impressed by by baroon the new the new name that's not in here is they now also hired a key guy from Marvel who was in Rajesh, in OBM team, I found out about that today. So pretty strong team. Also really great execution. They took a one silicon to production, and so in three years i. Have delivered 75 million of revenue since the company started. They are here five minutes from us, about 80 full time employees. The financing they raised to date is about 160 5 million from celestial Mayfield, etc. They currently have a term sheet from step stone ventures, whom I don't know a lot, but they are in lp in funds. Tushar may have some visibility into them, and they are leading the 120 5 million round at 700 pre money valuation. And the compliance discussion is about investment from our board member Mark, who has an ownership in the company.
Speaker 5
This is a quick summary of their blockchain product, which is really the key revenue driver for them. They are a four and three nanometer node, pretty high end on both Samsung and TSMC, custom ASIC. So this is what the box looks like from them. It's a custom ASICs in four different cooling technologies that's quite impressive, both air cooled, hydro cooled, as well as immersion cooling. So this is the box that they ship out to their customers. Their asps is around $5,000 and so they have shipped around 15,000 units last year, the market is quite large, obviously dominated by the Chinese, Chinese guys to date. So our time has very, very small opportunity to date, small camp in here, but a very large market. The new product that is interesting is for Qualcomm would be the AI product, which is the ultra USC, which is the scale up switch used to counter the NVIDIA product. And I'll talk a little bit about how that works. So this is the if you look at data center, what are the different question, one
Speaker 3
question on that mining product. So today, only marathon is the customer, right? No,
Speaker 5
they have about marathon is 70% of the customer. They have 35 customers.
There are 535, 35
Speaker 5
customers. But marathon was about 70% of the revenue contribution, everybody
in the US, or
Speaker 3
so. Marsha, do you know, as everybody in the US, or,
I don't know if Tushar, I'll have to confirm that.
Speaker 3
What I want to see is is, is this regulation against Bitcoin that's driving the demand for which regulation, and we know can change, that's driving the demand for the Bitcoin mining product, or do they have a better product than Bitcoin? Yeah, so
Speaker 5
the way he's and we'll have to spend time on it, and maybe Quinn has some visibility from last year, according to him, their product roadmap and the product they are shipping is superior on price performance and power, we need to validate that, compared to Bitcoin
Speaker 3
last time you had a call with marathon time, yeah,
Speaker 3
last year, and then the view was that this was better, potentially
Speaker 6
better, right? It still wasn't fully mature at the time. So that kind of the POS going to interview is that they can kind of scale up and hit commercial scale and quantities is better. It still only serves kind of the more proportion, I think, is the just like the liquid gold part of the market, that's not the entire market, right? That doesn't go after a lot of the stuff that main does for the pools and consumers, yeah, and all that other I think, as well. So still a sliver gun, I don't know if it handled, if it does handle all of marathons, yeah.
Okay, so they may have that made up.
Speaker 2
Yeah. Thanks, Bucha. Okay,
Speaker 5
so the new switch, just to give a quick glimpse on where it fits, this is a typical data center. You have a core switch at the top spine, a leaf switch, top of the rack switch, and then you have a whole bunch of PCIe switches. Now, the core spine, the top of the sorry, the the leaf pieces. This is pretty mature market. This is Cisco, Arista, HP, etc. So this is not the area of focus. The area of focus is the PCIe switch. And how do you ensure scale up in GPU clusters, given limitations we have in PC PCRE switch, this market is around 5.2 billion and growing at a much higher CAGR than the top of the rack switch market. Again, Broadcom Marvel are still strong players here, AIC, 100 ships with microchip. That's the vendor that we use. So that's the key problem here, the. Speed as well as throughput. Requirement of PCI is not sufficient for what is required now. So there are three approaches in the market. There is a proprietary approach from Nvidia. Then there is a new standard approach called UI link, and then the third approach we saw was from companies like and fabrica, which is a super NIC approach. So we'll quickly describe those three and the opportunity here would be to partner with AIC going forward. This is the
Speaker 2
Varsha have you, and Rajiv and team talk to the AIC 100 guys. Yeah.
Speaker 5
So we, we took the lead cooling guy last Friday to auradine, and I just came back from auradine with the UL lead from AIC. Because of our meeting changer, I didn't get a chance to regroup with them. So, so they spend time with both of them, the cooling lead, optical lead, Ravi, that you you're aware of. And then Ramesh leads the ual switch activity.
And both these reports to Rashid.
Speaker 5
Yes, so Ravi reports to into through somebody into Rashid. And then Ramesh is it's a different structure, but he drives the PCIe into Rashid.
Okay, got it okay
through Rashi
Speaker 3
for strategic and when I was only able to join the last part of that meeting this morning combines me that shouldn't be a problem.
Speaker 2
History with that one. Okay, not obvious section,
Speaker 3
because this dance from the ninth guy, I thought was very bureaucratic. I mean, it was like that Trump, you know, before Trump, Columbia. No. Now
he's going to check with
David, right, yeah, which was negative
Speaker 3
before, which? Which was negative because, like, we have to look at it holistically. But now that means all of the other board members will also have all these other angel investments,
all board members have in middle
investment, or many members have,
Speaker 2
yeah, then there's problem, potential problem for us, yeah, yeah. This one is especially well,
Speaker 3
this one since we already know, but most cases we don't know. All right,
Speaker 5
okay, yeah, so Quinn Tushar suggested to work on the strategic link in parallel to the compliance link that's going on. Hence, some of this, some of this effort. So this is how the URL link will work. That you know, you will have GPU clusters that will be connected that can go to at least 72 and above. And then they will scale out through a tri Ethernet. That's, that's how the composition will be. And they can go up to 200 gigabit per second per lane. That's the next level target from 112 that we have today. And we can, we can do a detail switch overview. There was a big document that I sent. This is just a quick summary. So there were three notable startups here. Xcon is a startup that started in as a CXL and PCIe switch, and now it's doing UL. Their investor base is currently from from Asia. They're based here. They're also close to our our building. They are shipping, so from a product standpoint, they're shipping CX L and PCI switch, predominantly competing with.com and they have advantages in terms of number, of course, cost, etc. And they will do a UL tape out. I believe they will probably be sometime, sometime around next year. And Fabric is a slightly different approach. Started with the fence and do like approach, of course, coming in with a super Nic, and so now they will also do a ual. The notable thing about end fabrica is Sutter Hill is a great investor in this space. Really broad portfolio of companies take very incubation like approach. So they're involved with the end fabrica has very strong financial backing, just like or a dime, but pretty well set up the tape out for the super NIC happened in 2024 and we have potential and opportunity here as well. The key points here are one and engagement with AIC, which I think should happen in the next couple of weeks, and then we'll go through some of the diligence on them. They are free products, though, you know, although the tape out is has happened as of December. And the third approach are companies like aurodyne, which is, you know, coming at it purely from from a URL standpoint. So my analysis was, and fabrica and aurodyne are good, good ones to. To look into as potential investments. I don't yet have 100% conviction in ex con for multiple reasons.
Speaker 2
Why don't you have, like, comfort around ex concrete? They are,
Speaker 5
you know, completely competing with Broadcom, and so I need to get comfort on how that roadmap will be, astera did well competing with Broadcom. So that's not to take away that particular competitive angle, but I just need to spend more time to see the Broadcom competition. Second, their investor base is all from Asia as well. So we need to that doesn't fit the QCD filter in terms of having a strong financial need. So those are the two open areas on XCOM.
Speaker 3
Question, wouldn't everybody compete with power line if they're building ual? I'm sorry, wouldn't everybody compete with Broadcom if they're building ual? So
Speaker 5
Broadcom is doing UEC, which is the so, you know, these guys also compete with Broadcom for the PCIe switch today that you ship today. So Broadcom got out of UL. Broadcom is doing UEC. So they will be in the scale out fabric overall, they said they will, you know, that will be their entry point. Broadcom is
Speaker 3
not doing UL at all. No, they're not doing AMD. So
Speaker 5
it's the main guys who are driving it. Are AMD, you got Intel, meta, Google, astera, there are five other members. So it's really the response from the chip guys to
Speaker 3
go rotcom, does TPU for Google. Google, that's
Speaker 5
correct. That's correct. So Broadcom was in it, but they believe that they UEC will be the way to go, and so we are spending more time on it to see how UEC will compare to ual. UEC is the as we discuss. It goes on top here, and ual goes this way. There are some technical differences between UEC and UL. So UEC is sort of packet based. This is transaction based. The speed of UEC is supposed to be still about two to 3x slower than UL. So we've gone through the spec to see the differences between the two, but we'll get one more informed view of how Broadcom will play if it is only UVC.
I think let's have that meeting. Yeah,
Speaker 2
so between in fabric and so sounds like excomm have some concerns with Chinese investors and so forth between in fabrica and orodaine, who's gone. It sounds like they have similar tech, or they're different. It's different. And
Speaker 5
fabrica is coming from the NIC, the super Nic, and so they are looking at it as a way to reduce some of the NICS that you need in the
in the stack. I'll just show
Speaker 2
a quick picture. So they're not building, they're not building a URL screen. Now
Speaker 5
they are going, so now they are starting.
Speaker 1
Yeah, they also doing CXL, right? Yes. So then
how do we determine which one to bet on? So
Speaker 5
between them, the ual focus from auradine is very strong. It's a pure play ual switch. I'll just pull up the let's quickly pull up.
Speaker 2
I guess first we have to believe in UL switch to can be successful then second
and on the right. So ual
Speaker 3
has a high likelihood of success at this point because there's warriors in the civic someone also has a lot of support. There's some other protocol. One has so in your discussion right now. So I guess so here's the
thing, I think so
Speaker 3
watchers put together presentation on this. So I said, with some group of us, we can have a separate decision so we can get to let's do this maybe for the second half of this week. We can happen regardless of whether we're doing
or dying or not.
Speaker 1
I think we'll continue to display any of these organizations.
Speaker 3
Yeah, I know we're saying we are in not part of that ual army. No, we
are trying to get there. I didn't see our name,
Speaker 1
okay, usually late to many of these organizations, but we mentioned we were there some other organizations. In addition to CXL, that will also mean organization
Speaker 3
you can be part of, I guess I don't just depends on which also the seriousness which is ual. I know for sure that meta is very serious in everything is very serious. So
very serious on every time the new standard comes along,
Speaker 3
I think they're building their chips the URL. So the question
Speaker 2
is, like, if media has a lock on this data center stuff, right, can the URL stuff actually get any tracking? That's the
That's the hard question, but that's that'll be very hard, that'll
Speaker 3
be very hard to answer. But I think the question is, which one we have to figure out in all the other new ones, which one is the rest of the hyperscalers and Broadcom and everybody else is most excited where the next set of billions of dollars they all try, at least these companies will be able to sell, whether or not eventually become successful. That's a
that's a finding out question.
The problem is, you're betting on this
Speaker 2
market. Yeah, in opium was going after Broadcom, still competing with Broadcom. Very tough thing to do, but the market was there. They just have to make a differentiator product, right? So the market is there smart next, and they have to create the market, create the market, and the timing becomes a big factor. Yeah, yeah, when this thing happens or not,
Speaker 3
look at the market and it may even not happen as possible, see the thing is, the market or networking and data center exists and scale up. Scale up. The question is, you can Google another proprietor. So if you want to build another product for it, the market exists for that product. The question is, you know, there's a bunch of different approaches. Are they better when they intersect. It's the same version with AI as six, right? When they intersect the market with GPUs, how is their performance going to be?
Speaker 1
This is a very standard place, right? Because when you have multiple standards, yeah, yeah,
it's very hard, like Bluetooth or HD,
yeah, we have to believe the market outside.
Speaker 3
And then we come back to this in the meeting when you set up. All right, okay, so I'll discuss this, and then this will again. I think we probably have a longer, separate session on AI agents and how we should take a look at AI agents in general. I'll talk about this one company crew, AI, I've been talking to them. We had a lot of meeting just before this one with AI, but before this I put together this table Bucha. We were looking at many of these AI agent company, which is, it's a mix of so all these AI agents is, in summary, what is an AI agent? It's an AI right now, as it stands, an AI agent is to is a piece of AI software that automates enterprise or consumer workflows. We saw open AI launch operator two days ago that is also a form of consumer AI agent that is browser based. Then we have a bunch of these different AI agents, and I'll talk through this. I think the framework that I thought would be easy to put together for now would be more around horizontal agents and more domain specific agents, horizontal agents. There's again, two types over there. One is these large general purpose agent systems, so open AI building agent models. And in that case, what they doing with open AI is, I mean, the reason why I separated those is because these are companies with billions of dollars that they embraced, they own their models as well, and their building agent takes systems on top. So the question is, where do you ideally, what you don't want to play or for as a new startup? In many of those places where open AI anthropic or x ai hasn't released AI agents yet, but I the news the rumors out there working on agenting systems as well. The second category over there is more horizontal, which is companies that are building agent frameworks and Agent templates that you can use APIs that you can use for building a call center, agent you can at the same time, you can use APIs for document processing. At the same time, you can use AI, Agent of legal assistant, and all of those, right? So there's several companies in that. There was one other company that we looked at last month, RCA, I in similar horizontal space, who AI is in that same. Is crew AI. Now this is a company, again, that has built large developer communities. So most of these agent framework or horizontal ones, they typically go with an open source product. Initially build developer communities, and then they use that to get enterprise adoption. That's the nature of these. So and so we've seen land change. The land chain also creates land graph, which is an agent in London index outside, or an auto Gen AI. And these are more horizontal plays in all of these for agents, at least right now, the company that everybody talks about is this company, crew, AI. They have hundreds of 1000s of developers. We just spoke with them, what they call cruise, cruise, into the group of agents that are executing together. So this month, they'll have 20 million crews that will execute on that platform. So, so this is a company that has the most traction in terms of the number of developers. We don't know the revenues he was talking on the call before you see the same bunch of six figure deals. So we don't know what that means. This company actually started in Brazil, so I sent it to Stephanie. Remember, she's still there. She left. Okay. So sent it to Stephanie last year, because he started in Sao Paulo, and then the founder just moved here, so Stephanie's not like Goa as otherwise. So last year, I think Stephanie tried to reach out to him, but he didn't respond. So what word was, Nicole sent this email that he wants to go work with crew. So I used that to get him to talk to us, and then we now he's interested. So they're raising around they're going to be raising. So that's not really just a race. When they announced that rounds, we say, announced that around that round was racist about so but, but now they're getting preempted. So they already getting preempted. In general, I think we can talk about one more detail. There's a lot of vertical specific the one that is really working very well. Everybody's talking about this cursor, which is coding agents. There's many, many companies, actually, they're vertical.
Speaker 1
There's also another one in between, say, the agent programming like programming framework, yeah, I think we can
Speaker 3
depend where, you know, there are agent these kinds of things, like these
frameworks
here, it's not like a framework. Word there,
Speaker 3
I know, yeah, word there is right here, world where would be here? I'll tell you where I would put word, where would be automation for enterprise, vertical enterprise workflows, which is, what is programming nature, so, which is similar to this company context that I will bring it up with. I like this company, word, where is similar in that space I looked at word, word, so, so I would still put them in more because they're doing more for the enterprise, end to end automation. World, where does more end to end automation,
and you can select its program. Why
Speaker 2
don't you put a together the chart that's maybe different view of this, instead of arguing like so
Speaker 3
anyways, going back to like vertical is in right now what, at least, what I'm seeing is many vertical agent companies. They're scaling very valid values. So that's a definitely like cursor. Is one company that has done, of course, zero 100 million dollars. But there's several companies like Sierra, as we all know, is doing more than 30 or $40 million AR, Sierra, same spaces, each company also started. Party AI, the legal agent company. Party AI is also doing very, very well and so similarly. So in that vertical AI agent space, there's many companies that are so so right now I see that vertical, vertical AI engines a better space, better space for us to deploy dollars, because you can get more revenues, money, more value. So that's but let me quickly COVID lines
and encoding space so the
Speaker 2
COVID, for instance, like the one we have tab nine that in that space too, yes, in
Speaker 3
the same space, Jesus in the same space. Tab nine is pre this new co pilot space. So however, we might have transitioned as well. I know Michelle has been trying to set up a call. And then I don't know how they're doing, though, and you might know how they're doing,
Speaker 2
they're they're doing, it's too small, like, I can't remember the 178,
million AR, yeah. So,
Speaker 3
so I think then they have traction. But you know where. Level, because, because the the other thing, so, there's another company. I meant, I mentioned podium. Podium is also there. These companies are all getting 50 million in a matter of class.
Speaker 2
How we find these guys earlier, like attempt 90 cameras, because they're in the space, right? Is it because so they don't
before
Speaker 3
that. So we didn't any of these, most of these
Sequoia and recent
all gone in. It's early,
Speaker 3
as you know, once they get in. So, but, but I've got So, for
example, let's say three
Speaker 3
dealing, yeah, I mean, but not treatment and GitHub co founders, everybody got involved. People, I know they're saying they're negative on both sides.
Everybody is saying, cursor cognition.
Speaker 3
But cursor is clearly, everybody is talking about it, at least right now. Everybody's using it, and everybody's and single person is
saying, where's the team from? The curtain
Speaker 3
or SF days, all from backgrounds we like to look up, but very smart. Everything that I learned you should talk to dow today as well. You have both comedic these
Speaker 1
can be called stamp lids, yeah, and they like going so fast. Two months after they launched, they got AR to 20 million. AR, wow. And I get azarovi to introduce to them say no reply, and I got exerts founder to make introduction, and they don't reply.
Speaker 3
Oh, really, yeah. So these guys, I think Hagen is another one that is going 50 million same vertical, AI, so Asian was a different story agent was that
Chinese nonrestrangers, they are same
as A cool engine is same as a cool
Speaker 7
so conviction investing the first and then benchmark investing. So convictions are go completely, kind of move the company, the team from China to the US, and then rebrand as
Speaker 3
so let's, I mean, there's ways to do this, or go early on some of these meds
at the out of getting
Speaker 3
however, truly I quit. There's no I mean, they have preempted, so I'm trying to make room. But let's discuss I in general, unless their traction is really, really good, I am. You don't like sort of I'm less bullish on the campaign against the land chain, too. So land chain is, again, the problem is, land chain got a lot of developer community, but the revenue traction is
Speaker 1
so so on the land grab open source, so they actually charging
Speaker 3
money. So maybe land grant. But COVID AI has much better traction, of course, so
Speaker 4
shut on. Crew AI, what are the domains the agents are deployed in? So they are domain agnostic,
hundreds of places, domain
Speaker 4
is there any 8020 rule there, like any key domains that dominate we
they do. But he said like
Speaker 3
that when I asked him last time, it was like, Yeah, we have 20 that get used the most. So this sales and call centers and financial and a few others
like document generation or something, marketing material,
Speaker 3
stuff, marketing material. And everybody has marketing video. But I think that let's go to so we've discussed more. This is developing the I'm trying to see if we even engage with us or an investment. That's why we have this COVID office. If we can
Speaker 2
bring customer, I think you probably let's go away. So for always, you get no customer.
Speaker 4
let's I'll try to go quick. I just want to cover flocks a little bit, because we have the management call coming up, so I don't want to go in cold for flocks tomorrow. So let me just quickly talk about said, I this. This is a US deal. The founder is based in SF, and he's Indian. So. So, so they're, they're raising Series B, and just a quick refresher on I had covered this maybe a month and a half ago. It's an ex PayPal team. They build the similar infrastructure for PayPal, and then they spun off to start. Said, I what they do effectively is use reinforcement learning to optimize cloud, and it's not just focused on the cost aspect of it, it's also focused on the performance and the availability, right? So when it goes down and depending on the application, what is the performance of your cloud infrastructure? And they don't just do it for compute, but they also do it for storage and AI workloads. So if you can look at the environments they support, I mentioned it in the solution part. It's not just a Kubernetes focused single cloud play. They actually do it across clouds and even on prem so that's just Kubernetes, but they also do VMs across AWS and Azure. They also do storage and streaming, and they will be adding support for Databricks and snowflake, right? So from a technology standpoint, they have a broad coverage, which definitely is not something that I've seen across other players today. Their traction has been good over the last year. It's, of course, grown from a small base. So they were at 700k in 2023, I just had a call yesterday, and they will close this year at 3 million. Arr, right? And it's mostly large enterprises, which is what got me excited in the first place, like COVID network, GSK, geodes spending half a million dollars on this platform. It's a 90% gross margin business with good expansion. Palo Alto expanded from 50 to 350 K. Now the update here from last time is they have received a term sheet. So they raised 18.5 from Sierra and Norwest, both of the funds. We know, in fact, Matt is a co investor in multiple of our companies. They are raising 25 million term sheet is led by AXA at 85 million pre money, right? So that's a quick snapshot of what the company does. And so years, at least a quick overview of feedback, yes,
Speaker 3
1:02:18
the day. So, so I remember when you presented? Was it December? Yeah, November, November. So they were trying to do, I think, 5 million and right? No, no, 3.5
1:02:32
they presented to us. I remember
Speaker 2
1:02:35
when we because there was no live deal that why we didn't pursue
1:02:39
No. We were also talking about,
Speaker 4
1:02:41
we were also talking I was going to reinvent and actually I ended up speaking with quite a few players there. We had four live opportunities at the same time, right? So we have cast AI, which probably will start the round the next, next week. Cloud zero got preempted in December. We don't have any allocation left. There they were at 25 million ARR fin out also closed the round. In fact, we are going to deploy fin out Boaz. This is an Israeli deal, and Boaz couldn't get allocation. So yeah, and so I didn't chase fin out, but I did talk to them at reinvent. So we have said, Said, I cast AI and Albert mentioned EXO stellar too, but I've talked to all of these companies, right? Prosper Ops is another one that's doing really well. They are at a 30, 40 million ENR, but they are not raising money. It's like a it's like a PE investment. They are profitable and not looking to raise money right now. The question
Speaker 3
1:03:45
Speaker 4
1:03:53
Speaker 3
1:06:07
So set I also doing DevOps. And then now cast AI also positioning themselves as DevOps, Dev SEC ops. So are they competitive? Not directly,
Speaker 4
1:06:16
no. So I specifically brought this up in the discussion, they don't see each other's competition. In fact, they jointly, sometimes target a customer. So what one thing I need to validate, still, that's why I'm talking to cast AI, is How deep are they going in the DevOps? Because I told you at reinvent DevOps was not in cast AI's pitch. It is specifically built for the CDC fundraise. And I was calling the I was calling the woodshed there. I told them, tell me what you have today, and what are you selling today, right? Don't talk to me about what you want to raise and what you want to do. But I'll come back to you on that, because cast AI, I know they don't have DevOps the depth of DevOps that they claim to be.
1:07:05
So maybe I should, then we should just give it to us,
Speaker 4
1:07:10
no, but we won't get, but we won't get, but
1:07:16
we won't get the afore, right?
Speaker 4
1:07:21
So I can, I can, actually, there's a good segue to cast AI, right? So here's some of the key points here. There 55% of the business is us. They did 19.5 90 million last year. They're planning to do 50, which I think Albert also mentioned. One thing that caught my attention was they have low gross margins. 75% is a bit low. So there might be some services angle there that we need to double click on. And they are going into live migrations of containers and VMs in second half, right? So this was the last round valuation. They were already very big team. Yes, they have, like, I think, 202 20 people on their payroll today. And the last post was 300 million. This was probably they were doing it, you know, five, 6 million. Err, they were at 300 million valuation, right? So that's on cast, and the Just a last bit on said, AI, said, I so this is what I asked them to prepare for our team. I actually went through each of the customers and tried to understand, is it only a Kubernetes place, which is which is not the case. They are not just Kubernetes. They actually do serverless. They do VMs and they do containers as well. So for each of these large customers, they have a roadmap to expand into multiple of these environments, right? Which is what I like about them. If you look at GSK, which is a recent customer win, they're spending 750 K on the platform, and it's a VMs and Kubernetes, right? And expansion is going to happen in storage. So I like this story here because there is a clear path to expand beyond just Kubernetes, and there is value in the tech. It is defensible because it's using reinforcement learning to build that a lot of others are doing automation. So I will continue digging Quinn is I'm setting up a meeting with Quinn, with the founder this week so we'll get more updates, and I'll follow up next week with a more detailed discussion.
1:09:31
Sounds good. Thanks. Okay.
Speaker 1
1:09:35
But simply, can ask them if they have anything to do with COVID here. Yeah,
1:09:40
I can, I
1:09:45
can check QCD tools.
Speaker 3
1:09:49
It's us. 64 people. Is the highest number of employees in US company. The.
1:10:01
Yes, quick
1:10:03
update. So, a quick update on
Speaker 2
1:10:07
you go back to Cassie, look see where the interactions, yeah, I totally was downstairs two years
Speaker 4
1:10:15
ago. Yeah, yes, when I looked at it, you are, there is a exchange with you. There is exchange with your team and with us as well. Yeah. All right,
1:10:28
so Flox, let's
Speaker 4
1:10:29
Yeah, so I'll keep it quick. We have the management call tomorrow. I was looking to get more data points and validation. This is an earlier stage deal. Luckily, I reached out to spectro, and their head of open source has actually worked on Nix before. I also talked to the CTO Saad. He actually hasn't worked on Nix, but he was very interested. He's like, actually, this sounds very interesting. I want to join the call. So the head of open source feedback was, he's worked on it. He liked it, but it is very hard to use. It's a lot of work, right? So what he's saying is, once you build the dependencies and the tree, if you were to add something that's not in Nix, it takes a lot of work. It takes a lot of uplift lifting to do, to actually add to the Nix platform, so he hasn't deployed it as widely, and he didn't know much about phlox, so I was addressing that phlox is trying to solve and make Nix easier for people like you to deploy it, right? So he was definitely interested, but he was like, I don't know enough about phlox to know that. So he validated the name. That was point number one. The other thing they I somehow felt that they were trying to defend containers and Kubernetes. So the first 10 minutes was all about, you know, we can do all of what phlox does in a container. And I was like, Guys, I'm not trying to, you know, make a, like, a conservative case for spectro. You don't have to be defensive. But they kept saying, you know, it's not replacing containers or Kubernetes. So that was, that was the spectral clock call Tushar, and I talked to the lead investor edition. So they let the seed round in the company. The feedback that they had was a lot of their portfolio companies were using Nix, and they got these, these guys are champions within their own companies, who actually love Nix, and they were looking to invest in a company that can commercialize next. Right at that time, they didn't find any, and flocks came up through one of the Israeli seed seed funds. So it was a, is, it was a seed intro, intro that they got, and then they invested in the company. They usually don't do seed checks, but they really like this, and they were they say that they're really impressed by Ron because he's actually able to take on Nick's leadership and really command the roadmap there. So Ron sits on the board for next so that was something which was interesting. They said that they've talked to Nvidia, and Nvidia is a user today, so they were not a paying customer in December, but they are a paying customer today. But it's a small use case only the software team is using it. It's like a 2025, person team. Here are the negatives from the call, right? So the addition feedback was, guys, this is super early. They are probably six to 12 months before commercialization. But the only reason edition is doubling down is because they like what they see. They have these early validations, but they acknowledge that they don't have a path to revenues today. They have a pipeline. So he actually said it's six to 12 months before commercialization, right? So we have to go into the deal or the opportunity knowing this early stage and revenues will take six to 12 months to come in. And he called out some of the case studies that he knows, like Shopify is a big, big next shop. Microsoft is using it. Replit is using it. Hashicorps founder Michelle Hashimoto, is actually a big proponent of phlox. So there are, like, subjective validations. I don't have, like tangible data points, so I know Albert asked for Kubernetes versus Nix, right? So I asked the team to put something together, and here's how it compares, right? So if you look at Kubernetes on the left, they had some 415 450 pull requests compared to 7000 8000 pull requests. If you look at the contributors, it's like, it's almost like double, right? So Nick's has 5000
1:14:40
7000 Yes,
Speaker 2
1:14:43
meeting. Can we do this? Is it? Is this actually 10?
Speaker 3
1:14:46
The meeting set up with them? Yeah, yeah, the round is already, I mean, I think, if I feel, I mean, I think it's good, let's have the discussion. Tomorrow with them, and let's circle back again. It feels Anyways, if the question is, should we put a small check or not? Yeah, that's the Yeah. That's the question. After the call tomorrow. Sounds good.
Speaker 4
1:15:11
Sounds good. I can, I can also send some material to read for prep for the meeting. So before the call, I'll send you, send you guys some materials. That's good. Thanks.
1:15:22
Thank you.
1:15:37
I'm mostly done. Varsha, I think we haven't. I haven't modeled in the warrants yet on our return as so that's the only part
Speaker 5
1:15:43
left. Why don't you attend the call on Wednesday? Yeah, did I send you the I don't think so I have it, okay, so that way, then you can finalize. It's at 10 o'clock. Okay? I think
1:16:00
that is a bit confusing. Okay,
Speaker 5
1:16:13
so factor that in, yeah, and then we can walk through it on Wednesday. Okay, yes, I
Speaker 4
1:16:42
people are in the building, so we lost the moment or time change, right? So
1:16:50
then we don't have
1:17:03
All Right, I'm
