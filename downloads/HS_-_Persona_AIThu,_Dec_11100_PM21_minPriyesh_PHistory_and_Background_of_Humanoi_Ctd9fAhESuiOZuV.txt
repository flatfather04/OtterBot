============================================================

S Speaker 10:00Company started last year, and I would say that we really took a careful consideration of what market makes sense for humanoids, and it wasn't obvious to us. I've got about a 30, almost 30 year history in developing humanoid device. I spent about 15 years at the NASA Johnson Space Center, the Texas robotics lab. I mean, just one of the most incredible places one could hope to start a career, just some of the best and brightest minds go to work every day and just go home at night and be like, I gotta get better. I'm just not good enough to be in this lab. And I was really lucky enough 15 years later to be leading, leading a lot of the programs there. A lot of flagship programs invested, and I became an entrepreneur up 10 years ago, for all the budding entrepreneurs in the audience. And it shifts hard. It is. It's, you know, just keep putting one foot in front of the other one. The resiliency that is required to really commercialize a piece of technology of the market. The markets unforgiving. They will just chew you up and spit you out. But, you know, don't get discouraged. Just keep going. But what I'd like to talk about today is, there's, there's going to be, I think, a lot of the discussions I've already had with everyone, and it's great to see a lot of old colleagues and friends some new colleagues and friends, but, but this, this idea of market, keeps coming up, and I keep thinking to myself, you know, we're human is going to be adopted first. You're probably not going to find a stronger human critic than myself that has a humanoid company. I feel like it. They're not exactly, you know, it shouldn't be a hammer where everything is a nail. I think they have a place. I think they're a tool. I think we have to have this sense of responsibility about the timelines. We're talking about, the adoption timelines. I heard the messy middle of adoption earlier today. I also heard it regarded as like a marathon, and where all the runners are sort of bunched up in the beginning. I sort of think the runners are still starting out and stretching. It's kind of like, you know, the idea that I've got in my head. But I'd like to actually, you know, first, first open up with with a little bit of history here one of the great moments in my career. We flew Robonaut to the space station back in about 2011 and you can imagine building an anthropomorphic robotic system, a robotic astronaut, the home of the astronauts. It was not uncontroversial, I can tell you that. But eventually we went over the astronaut corps. We flew this up and just a fascinating, fascinating time. But actually, after this famous handshake between Commander Dan Burbank and Robonaut, Saturday Night Live picked it up. And of course, Saturday Night Live, which has really funny things to say about things,

S Speaker 13:07I always it's always intriguing to me that as soon as you start talking about human beings, we immediately go to world domination Terminator. They're coming for everybody. And then no sooner did we fly a robot to the space station. You know, Saturday Night Live is like, this is phase one. And you know, I reflect on that sometimes I think the Terminator is probably a ways off, etc. But let's stick on the NASA theme for just a second, because I think this is where it gets really compelling for me.

S Speaker 33:37What was the goal of the space race? And, you know,
What was the goal of the space race? And, you know,
What was the goal of the space race? And, you know,
What was the goal of the space race? And, you know,
S Speaker 13:42when you study it, you really, you really determine that it was, that it was the US and the Soviets at the time, really trying to demonstrate to the world which system of government was better, which which national framework was going to instigate the most innovation, what was going to instigate the most progress, most scientific discovery, and the US, admittedly, was very behind in this, right? I mean, the Sputnik event of 57 we, you know, we were like, holy cow, there's something up in orbit. This is crazy, which kicked off this entire national initiative around the space race. But the goal of the space race was not to put a person on the moon, right? That was right. So, so in order, the goal was, let's, let's, let's talk about the framework of government. The strategy was, okay, we can demonstrate that prowess in space. The objective was to put somebody on the moon. And tactically, how are we going to do that? Well, we're going to have the Gemini Program. We're going to figure out rendezvous organ, etc, stuff like that. And I hear a lot of times like, what is the goal of the humanoid evolution or the revolution happening? And if you were to talk to everybody in the room, everybody would have something different, but persona. We really thought about this. We were like, Okay, if we're gonna get involved in this. And, and, you know, I co founded the company with with Jerry Pratt last year. And it was not, again, not obvious to us exactly where the market the first mover market, because when Jerry and I sat down, I told him, I said, Listen, we're going to be obsessively commercially focused. We are going to, you know, we're not going to just be a cool tech company. We're not going to raise trillions of dollars and then wonder what we've built in 10 years, we are going to be absolutely commercially focused, and demos make really crappy businesses. So we've got to figure out a way to get from the demo out of pilot hell and into commercialization. Let's lay out a plan to do that. And so the goal, the goal for us was we're actually labor is a strategic resource, and what humanoids represent is actually a geopolitical capability layer. And I think that that's something that we all talk about, or we allude to at times, but we kind of get lost that, that that's actually what we're dealing with here, that there is real birth rate collapse, there's real population, there's real there's real population issues. The UN has put tons of studies together, and I know a lot of this data for everyone in this room is probably old hat, but it's worth actually talking about because it's fascinating. It's utterly fascinating. When I pull some un studies to create this we one of the US studies is like, we're going to think about 9 billion people over the next 50, 6070, years, and we're going to peel over, we're already seeing an utter collapse of the growth rate, so in the last 25 sorry, that's the next I apologize but, but this growth rate decline and also the population peeling over, that's going to create some existential issues, not at the same time we are aging. So one in 11 people today are over the age of 65 in the country, one in three people by 2050 in Japan, one in three people in Korea will be over the age of 65 one in four in the US, and one in six on average, in the world. So not only are we creating fewer of us to do things, we are also creating a top heavy society to where we are aging at the same time, and so now you're coming up with this industrial squeeze. So look around. We live in a physical world. We have trillions of dollars of things installed all around us. We want to build things. We want to continue to progress. But yet the economic engine that labor, that strategic component to every national initiative, which it says labor force, is eroded. So ergo, what do we do? And then some of these stats are insane, right? 72% of the people out there, 72% of industrial leaders saying they're struggling to fill these industrial roles. 50% is expected to exit the industrials market over the next 25 years, over the next 10 years, what the HR professionals are showing us through the Bureau of Labor Statistics is they're going to expect a 40% decline in applications to these industrial markets. By 2030 we could have an 85 million worker shortage. And the stat that I didn't put on here is that Goldman Sachs expects about medium, about 40, 50 million units cumulative labor by 2040 just to maintain the economic tensions that we exist and have today. This should scare everyone, because this is data. This isn't like this isn't hype on the collapse. This is, this is this is grounded information about what is coming. Yet we live in a physical world, and what I contend is that the last 50 years has been characterized by the ubiquitous manipulation of the virtual world. We become gods into the computer. I think the next 50 years could be the ubiquitous manipulation physical world. And I think that is going to be the largest industrial transformation, the largest transformations in society, as the sun. Investors tell us the largest so how do we assess it. To me, this is extremely important. How do we assess it? I've seen so many humanoid companies run off into the ether, and they drop immediately into tactics. Remember the goal, strategy objectives I was talking about? We immediately jump into tactics. Our harmonic drives are not who gives a shit? I don't know. What are we trying to do? Are we going to use
when you study it, you really, you really determine that it was, that it was the US and the Soviets at the time, really trying to demonstrate to the world which system of government was better, which which national framework was going to instigate the most innovation, what was going to instigate the most progress, most scientific discovery, and the US, admittedly, was very behind in this, right?

And so the goal, the goal for us was we're actually labor is a strategic resource, and what humanoids represent is actually a geopolitical capability layer. And I think that that's something that we all talk about, or we allude to at times, but we kind of get lost that, that that's actually what we're dealing with here, that there is real birth rate collapse, there's real population, there's real there's real population issues. The UN has put tons of studies together, and I know a lot of this data for everyone in this room is probably old hat, but it's worth actually talking about because it's fascinating. It's utterly fascinating. When I pull some un studies to create this we one of the US studies is like, we're going to think about 9 billion people over the next 50, 6070, years, and we're going to peel over, we're already seeing an utter collapse of the growth rate, so in the last 25 sorry, that's the next I apologize but, but this growth rate decline and also the population peeling over, that's going to create some existential issues, not at the same time we are aging. So one in 11 people today are over the age of 65 in the country, one in three people by 2050 in Japan, one in three people in Korea will be over the age of 65 one in four in the US, and one in six on average, in the world. So not only are we creating fewer of us to do things, we are also creating a top heavy society to where we are aging at the same time, and so now you're coming up with this industrial squeeze. So look around. We live in a physical world. We have trillions of dollars of things installed all around us. We want to build things. We want to continue to progress. But yet the economic engine that labor, that strategic component to every national initiative, which it says labor force, is eroded. So ergo, what do we do? And then some of these stats are insane, right? 72% of the people out there, 72% of industrial leaders saying they're struggling to fill these industrial roles. 50% is expected to exit the industrials market over the next 25 years, over the next 10 years, what the HR professionals are showing us through the Bureau of Labor Statistics is they're going to expect a 40% decline in applications to these industrial markets. By 2030 we could have an 85 million worker shortage. And the stat that I didn't put on here is that Goldman Sachs expects about medium, about 40, 50 million units cumulative labor by 2040 just to maintain the economic tensions that we exist and have today. This should scare everyone, because this is data. This isn't like this isn't hype on the collapse. This is, this is this is grounded information about what is coming. Yet we live in a physical world, and what I contend is that the last 50 years has been characterized by the ubiquitous manipulation of the virtual world. We become gods into the computer. I think the next 50 years could be the ubiquitous manipulation physical world. And I think that is going to be the largest industrial transformation, the largest transformations in society, as the sun. Investors tell us the largest so how do we assess it. To me, this is extremely important. How do we assess it? I've seen so many humanoid companies run off into the ether, and they drop immediately into tactics. Remember the goal, strategy objectives I was talking about? We immediately jump into tactics. Our harmonic drives are not who gives a shit? I don't know. What are we trying to do? Are we going to use
S Speaker 49:03every cyclic drives? Are we are we got, you know, there's so many tactical decisions that we try to make when, in fact, we have no idea what we're even trying to do.

S Speaker 19:30we are looking for real, palatable business cases. So I decided to come up with something. I didn't call it the humanoid adoption Readiness Index, because when I pasted the equation on the slide, I had already used that as a graphic, but I wanted to go back and change it to an H. I couldn't do it because it was a small but what I decided to do was to try to assess what market might make sense to put keywords into. And there are other things out there, like technology readiness levels and manufacturability indexes, and there's a lot of there's an AI index now, but actually no one has really thought about what markets make sense in the context of this for human or robots. And so I said, All right, let's make a five dimensional model. All models are wrong, but maybe some models are useful. And like I mentioned, I kind of just made this up, but it started making a sense. It gave us at least another vein in which direction to head. And so we actually pulled data, Labor Statistics, unfilled job roles. We assessed how hard we need to develop for the tasks, the industry, the environmental, unpredictability, and we assigned some we assigned some weighting, weighting factors, to initially set them all to one. And then we started taking those weighting factors around a little bit. And here's what we came up is the home might be the last place you might want to try to commercialize a humanoid robot into. And I've been a vocal critic of the home market. Now it's normalized. So home dental school is zero, but that's because we normalize it from zero to 100 and so I decided, well, that's a little unfair, so let's give the home a little box. But so I created this spider chart with a five dimensional model, and I'm adjusting it, I'm adding other things to it, etc. But it was like, alright, what general direction should we have? And what came out of this was, if you are interested in the actual scarcity, if you're interested in the real labor economics, if you're interested in normalizing that to a couple of other dimensions, you find that the skilled trades and heavy industry make a ton of
we are looking for real, palatable business cases. So I decided to come up with something.
