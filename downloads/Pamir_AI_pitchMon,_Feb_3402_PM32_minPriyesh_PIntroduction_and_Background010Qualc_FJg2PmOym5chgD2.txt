S Speaker 10:22I me again. We met at an event in Palo Alto, right? Yeah, I remember going through the product, yes,
I me again. We met at an event in Palo Alto, right? Yeah, I remember going through the product, yes,

0:31yeah, a couple miles ago. Yeah. That's
yeah, a couple miles ago. Yeah. That's
yeah, a couple miles ago. Yeah. That's
yeah, a couple miles ago. Yeah. That's
S Speaker 10:33very interesting. I also went through the video. Seems like the product is working a lot better than the last time we saw it.

S Speaker 20:40Yeah, yeah. Like last time that was kind of like, hobby project, yeah, later on, the hobby project, project turns on, like, turns into actual demand, kind of Yeah,
Yeah, yeah. Like last time that was kind of like, hobby project, yeah, later on, the hobby project, project turns on, like, turns into actual demand, kind of Yeah,
Yeah, yeah. Like last time that was kind of like, hobby project, yeah, later on, the hobby project, project turns on, like, turns into actual demand, kind of Yeah,
Yeah, yeah. Like last time that was kind of like, hobby project, yeah, later on, the hobby project, project turns on, like, turns into actual demand, kind of Yeah,
S Speaker 10:55where you mean, tell me more. Tell me, tell me how things have been shaping. What are you thinking about it? You also mentioned you're starting to raise around. Would love to go through it with you? Or would you suggest I give you a background about Qualcomm just before we start?

S Speaker 21:13Yeah. I mean, last time you mentioned a little bit like something, like minimal check size, it's like 2 million or something, yeah, yeah, but please do Yeah. So
Yeah. I mean, last time you mentioned a little bit like something, like minimal check size, it's like 2 million or something, yeah, yeah, but please do Yeah. So
Yeah. I mean, last time you mentioned a little bit like something, like minimal check size, it's like 2 million or something, yeah, yeah, but please do Yeah. So
Yeah. I mean, last time you mentioned a little bit like something, like minimal check size, it's like 2 million or something, yeah, yeah, but please do Yeah. So
S Speaker 11:25absolutely. So a lot of focus has been, I would say, in consumer hardware, AI consumer Harvard, we have invested, we invested in humane but that that wasn't a great outcome. I would say the company didn't do well. But other than that, quite actively, the I think the team is deploying quite actively capital into AI investments, in terms of models we have done, anthropic hugging face and then in ML ops, weights and biases, scale AI. Then, more recently, we're also looking at a lot of applied AI agent layer investments, check sizes would be anywhere between two to ten million typically series A plus, but in AI, more recently, we have started doing seed as well. Yeah. Did you do you
absolutely. So a lot of focus has been, I would say, in consumer hardware, AI consumer Harvard, we have invested, we invested in humane but that that wasn't a great outcome.

S Speaker 22:18invest a rabbit? Roi, like
invest a rabbit? Roi, like
invest a rabbit? Roi, like
invest a rabbit? Roi, like
S Speaker 12:21rabbit? No, we did not, but I think we have seen rabbit, someone in the team is connected to them, and we did evaluate that some point in the time, yeah, yeah, they're interesting. Like, do you know how, how they're doing as a business?
rabbit? No, we did not, but I think we have seen rabbit, someone in the team is connected to them, and we did evaluate that some point in the time, yeah, yeah, they're interesting. Like, do you know how, how they're doing as a business?

S Speaker 22:38Not so much. Like, to me, it feels like they are like IOT device, pretty much.
Not so much. Like, to me, it feels like they are like IOT device, pretty much.

2:46That's how I feel about it. Yeah, got it,
That's how I feel about it. Yeah, got it,

S Speaker 23:13But like, for now, I feel like we can just quickly go over, like,
But like, for now, I feel like we can just quickly go over, like,

But like, for now, I feel like we can just quickly go over, like,
3:21what happened? Like,
S Speaker 23:24I do have, like a big dad, but I'll try to Yeah, okay,

S Speaker 13:31that's surprising for an early stage company. What all information you have in there?
that's surprising for an early stage company. What all information you have in there?

that's surprising for an early stage company. What all information you have in there?
S Speaker 23:47just, I feel like writing deck is kind of a good way for for team to clear out the direction and stuff. We're pretty set on the direction. So what we're doing is we call is the agent host. So, like,
just, I feel like writing deck is kind of a good way for for team to clear out the direction and stuff. We're pretty set on the direction. So what we're doing is we call is the agent host. So, like,
just, I feel like writing deck is kind of a good way for for team to clear out the direction and stuff. We're pretty set on the direction. So what we're doing is we call is the agent host. So, like,
just, I feel like writing deck is kind of a good way for for team to clear out the direction and stuff. We're pretty set on the direction. So what we're doing is we call is the agent host. So, like,
4:06anything you want to do
anything you want to do
anything you want to do
anything you want to do
4:09on edge, you it has
S Speaker 24:13to be everywhere. And like, agent has to be everywhere. But to be everywhere, it has to have, like, large amount of hardware carrier, pretty much Singapore embedded system is everywhere, but there's no agent running on it, right? What we why we building it is, we feel like, like past, like 20 years, is just information explosion. Yeah, that's why you need a phone to have access to information now, like, you know, like, every two days we got a new model, so that's kind of what we call it, like intelligence explosion, but there's no direct access to that yet. I mean, when we're talking about ad, you use phone or laptop, but that's pretty much the only way now. But to use actual model, either have to build a web app or like phone app. But we just don't feel that's that's kind of a barrier at in between to access intelligence. So that's why we think there, there needs to be more like direct access to actual smart embedded system to have to let people have access to intelligence, just phone, a laptop, if that's not enough, that's one that's one reason. Another reason why we're building it is called intelligence density. This is a study, actual study, down back, like by Ting Hua University and a lot of company are backed by something called density law. So it's like Moore's law, but density law meaning every 100 days the density of the model knowledge base is double. So which means, like, every 100 days you got a smaller model that's smarter for now, like three months ago, we were using 3b model, but now we're shifting towards 1.5 B model, similar performance, and it's about like 100 IQ, if you check the benchmark is up there with GPD 3.5 you know, which can't let's assume we can replace 0.5 unit of labor, you know, six months down, down the line later, we can get 150 IQ that's replaced by person, something like that, and we are totally capable of running on edge now, right?
to be everywhere. And like, agent has to be everywhere. But to be everywhere, it has to have, like, large amount of hardware carrier, pretty much Singapore embedded system is everywhere, but there's no agent running on it, right?

So it's like Moore's law, but density law meaning every 100 days the density of the model knowledge base is double. So which means, like, every 100 days you got a smaller model that's smarter for now, like three months ago, we were using 3b model, but now we're shifting towards 1.5 B model, similar performance, and it's about like 100 IQ, if you check the benchmark is up there with GPD 3.5 you know, which can't let's assume we can replace 0.5 unit of labor, you know, six months down, down the line later, we can get 150 IQ that's replaced by person, something like that, and we are totally capable of running on edge now, right?

S Speaker 16:50And tianqi, the reason you are downsizing the model size, is it because of bar requirements or any other factor that?

7:02so like for us, our company vision
so like for us, our company vision
so like for us, our company vision
so like for us, our company vision
S Speaker 27:08first is using the 100 IQ to build a, like, really good embedded QA system. Like QA is question answering that we we doing that just because a lot of deep mind from that, and we feel like we can address it now. But overall, we want to build the best embedded agent platform. We are a two developer company,
first is using the 100 IQ to build a, like, really good embedded QA system. Like QA is question answering that we we doing that just because a lot of deep mind from that, and we feel like we can address it now. But overall, we want to build the best embedded agent platform.

We are a two developer company,
7:33but in the long run,
S Speaker 27:36it's we want to be like fit the largest intelligence to smallest box. If that makes sense, we just feel that's the very basic infrastructure of the future, and we're providing that box. So no matter is human, humanoid, or, like, industrial, yeah, or any anywhere that we saw internet, you do need that box. That's kind of
it's we want to be like fit the largest intelligence to smallest box. If that makes sense, we just feel that's the very basic infrastructure of the future, and we're providing that box. So no matter is human, humanoid, or, like, industrial, yeah, or any anywhere that we saw internet, you do need that box. That's kind of

8:07our vision, yeah. Does that answer your question?
our vision, yeah. Does that answer your question?
our vision, yeah. Does that answer your question?
our vision, yeah. Does that answer your question?
S Speaker 18:09It does, yes. I understand the reason, yeah, yeah,
It does, yes. I understand the reason, yeah, yeah,
It does, yes. I understand the reason, yeah, yeah,
It does, yes. I understand the reason, yeah, yeah,
S Speaker 28:13and yeah, this is kind of my calendar. And of last year, pretty much, yeah, taking, call, like 10 to 10, pretty much, and we had, like 150
and yeah, this is kind of my calendar. And of last year, pretty much, yeah, taking, call, like 10 to 10, pretty much, and we had, like 150

8:28or something costs emails,
or something costs emails,
or something costs emails,
or something costs emails,
S Speaker 28:32and this is kind of the distribution, of course, a lot of them from developers, like to Me, this feels like a no brainer, no brainer. Because, as for right now, developer don't have a way to play with edge like edge model or edge device. You can buy a Raspberry Pi or you can buy a JSON, right? But like those are all kind of raw compute.

9:01A lot of them don't know how to play visit.
A lot of them don't know how to play visit.
A lot of them don't know how to play visit.
A lot of them don't know how to play visit.
S Speaker 29:05I We got so many calls calling us, hey, I want to do this. That on my on my own business, a lot of SMB. And I told them, oh, you can just buy a GPU or build your own server to run stuff. They don't know how to do that. They ask us if we can sell them a box that's plug and play, pretty much, to make us realize if we give them like five GPU and we tell them one GPU is model ready, interface ready, everything on it, they buy that. That's kind of one opportunity we see. And of course, a lot of calls are from like SMB and like just a lot of control environment, like farm, factory logistic, where they don't get access to internet,

10:00but they need local intelligence.

S Speaker 110:05There seems to be a lot of it's way, it seems very industry agnostic. Can you pick a few industries over here and give me examples of what some of these customers are using the product for?
There seems to be a lot of it's way, it seems very industry agnostic. Can you pick a few industries over here and give me examples of what some of these customers are using the product for?

S Speaker 210:16Yep, here I listed one example in one like vertical,
Yep, here I listed one example in one like vertical,

10:24we got a lot of call from logistics.
we got a lot of call from logistics.
we got a lot of call from logistics.
we got a lot of call from logistics.
10:29I for some reason,
S Speaker 210:32for shipping stuff like the top five US companies, they are the only cover, like 15% of the market, the rest is bunch of SMB. We got calls from, you know, a team of three, like a parents plus a kids, and they running like truck lit like couple. I don't know how many, like 1020 truck truck fit, right, and they still have like 1010s, of millions dollars of revenue, those kind of small SMB our places in us, right? So they told us the when they carry, like fresh stuff, like, like fruit from point A to point B, it takes a couple hours, and if you don't control the temperature, right, the banana gonna get get spoiled and they lose some money, right? However, like the people driving the truck
for shipping stuff like the top five US companies, they are the only cover, like 15% of the market, the rest is bunch of SMB. We got calls from, you know, a team of three, like a parents plus a kids, and they running like truck lit like couple.

We got calls from, you know, a team of three, like a parents plus a kids, and they running like truck lit like couple. I don't know how many, like 1020 truck truck fit, right, and they still have like 1010s, of millions dollars of revenue, those kind of small SMB our places in us, right? So they told us the when they carry, like fresh stuff, like, like fruit from point A to point B, it takes a couple hours, and if you don't control the temperature, right, the banana gonna get get spoiled and they lose some money, right?

So this, they told us, if we can have the device in the track that talks to the driver, which has the information of the product that's in the carrier, in the truck, and also the temperature. So you can just tell the driver in whatever like, if it speaks Spanish, like it tell, tells the truck driver to lower the temperature. That's pretty much all they want. And they didn't have the chance to do that before, because they don't know how to build a web app. They don't want to run anything on the server. They don't have, like, a dedicated team to build hardware for them. If you give them Raspberry Pi, they don't know what to do with it, but they want a box that come with the model, and sorry, my alarm just read, yeah, no problem box to care to have a model ready that they can just talk to, and they have have an easy way to drag and drop files to it. That's pretty much it. And like, for some reason, the owner of those small, medium sized pieces, they are in their like service. Now they have chat GPT.

S Speaker 113:13so Tinky, for some of these players, how? So what I'm getting at is, let's say it's an edge application. It works on environments where you don't have internet access, and then you're selling to SMBs. So How scalable is it in terms of you don't have internet access, so you cannot search the web for each of these specific use cases? You would probably need to fine tune the model based on their industry or use case. Knowledge, knowledge base. Is it? Is it you doing that today? Is it the SMB is doing it? And how does that process work? You mentioned draw, draw, dragging and dropping files. How does that work? How have you built it?

S Speaker 213:58Right now? Our solution is to just use SD card, like we have a full like automated rack system built in device, light weighted rack system, so which means, when they insert the SD card, will automate just embedding all this stuff in it. And like most of the their stuff are stored in Excel Word documents. Yeah, that's that's from, from what, what we see, like their whole like grocery store items, like just big Excel we're able to, like, we validate that like 100 pages. We able to embed it in like, honor minutes. So that's kind of how we how we presume they're going to update stuff. And they are used to doing a lot of office. We saying they are still using some graphs, so they should be easily able to upgrade that like per her device. But like, if deploy, like, there's like, companies trying to buy the hundreds of them, we provide them away OTA services, like a

Like container drops, there's bundle product in it, and the blue collar workers coming, checking stuff like they have this this much, pages like founders, pages of product information, does this goes to costume or not? A lot of questions need to answer. So they're checking five by one. So all those works are basically querying data, right? Yeah, they could just be down with, like, natural language, they just asking, like, what's, what's, tell me the product number about this, and where should I put it?

S Speaker 216:25That's a That's a great question. I'm in China right now. Yeah, I what I seen, like, there's, like, pretty much three big company, like logistic company, covering the whole country, and they are able to do vertical solution like what you just mentioned, from top down, right? However, a lot of SMB couldn't do it in us, just because the lack of like development capability, also it's I asked the same question to the to the SMB, right?

Why don't you just use a phone, right?
S Speaker 217:13There's very hard to require every truck driver to have a local ready phone they're still using an Android phone from like five years ago. So that's when the second if it's not local ready, meaning they have to build a server, meaning they have to sharing stuff on cloud or have a software team to maintain it. It's just way harder to sell like cloud service to those business then serve, serve them a one time ready device. And also, of course, they have no way to build hardware, dedicate hardware for that. A lot of Chinese, the Chinese company I've seen, they have like a scan gun, scanning gun or something, to link to that, their system to do that, the SMB us, they don't, they, they don't have way to do that because they don't like one inset. We find out is there's just no manufacturing here, right? I mean, us, we're still building rockets and drones here, but like small electronics, no gun, no one is doing that, which means there's no supply chains. And if there's no supply chain, it's very hard to find a hardware or embedding engineer, like all the kids out of Berkeley or MIT there. No one is doing like hardware stuff business now, right?

Which is another insight we have is,
S Speaker 218:51for example, like I'm I'm not actually coding every day now, like I'm talking to our M to code, right? The barrier is super low now, right? No one is doing the same for hardware, like, if I give a recipe prior to a college case. Now they might not know how to like play with it. So we realized the same thing, that those hardware dev kit need to be way Dom, or we have lower limb inter barrier for people now, just like how cursor did for software, yeah, the wise building hardware for that. That's kind of our angle. Like we're going to build the first like, dev kits that has LM ready for people to play miss and to implement stuff on it. Yeah,
for example, like I'm I'm not actually coding every day now, like I'm talking to our M to code, right? The barrier is super low now, right?

S Speaker 219:42And, yeah, that this is what it looks like. We have, like a design team already working on that. This is kind of our flagship product. It's kind of running on a Qualcomm chip. That's where we find the most like density at Qualcomm can pretty much handle, like, maybe a model, but super low power consumption, yeah, yeah. And it has, like, standard,

S Speaker 220:27right now, like we are, we're gonna relaunch this device with a rest cm five. We're able to get a 3b model to run like 10 plus token per second on just a Raspberry Pi five which have like zero NPR, zero GPU on it. So we anticipate, like, for the Qualcomm I'm working on the Qualcomm chip is a little bit harder to develop on it, yes, but we anticipate can run like a 7v model on like 10 plus or 20 plus token on it, which is gonna be a like, game changer.

S Speaker 221:29They telling us, every day my parking lot parks six cars, the average What if one day there's 20 cars? Yeah, something got me wrong, like what's happening? So right now, they need to hire people and rotate to do that, to do that like a monitoring like 24/7 they want a camera to a smart camera to be there that's running off solar panel, and they can just ask why there's 20 people there, what they are doing, and is there cost coming?

22:10And tell me what's
S Speaker 222:11the license number. Write down the license number so all those work can be done with just LLM, actually. VRM, right? Because it has general, it can be general enough so they don't have to train CV model anymore. That's another revolution, kind of pivoting point out. Yeah, that's kind of a lot of use cases, visual based. That's why, yeah, got
the license number. Write down the license number so all those work can be done with just LLM, actually. VRM, right?

S Speaker 122:39it. Got it. Can you tell me a little bit about the business model I saw that you have a slide on that. What does it how much? How are you pricing it? What does it make for you to sort of build something? Yeah, we're trying to,
it. Got it. Can you tell me a little bit about the business model I saw that you have a slide on that. What does it how much? How are you pricing it? What does it make for you to sort of build something? Yeah, we're trying to,

S Speaker 222:54like, do 250 per device, the SOM we are using for, for the floss, flagship product is about the counter box at cost. And for those business who buy a lot, like I said, I give them a oat service subscription, including, like, either updating data or update models, or, like adding a new like API endpoints. Some, some of the company, they have internal API endpoints. And also, like the logistic one I mentioned, is that kind of a big vertical. We see multiple big verticals requiring same kind of product we might strategically giving them customized to be product. That's kind of the piece of business model for now, but we more anticipating a lot of just
like, do 250 per device, the SOM we are using for, for the floss, flagship product is about the counter box at cost.

23:53developers to adapt.
S Speaker 223:56So mainly we feel like we have a like, first mover advantage here, because no one is building this right now. We started, like half year ago. That's why we're at the stage of launching this. A good developer ecosystem is pretty important. There's a couple people coming like, they just want to rebuild the home assistant. Like, home assistant today is not actually smart. You still have to have a voice comment, yeah. They want to build something that just watching you right without connecting internet. Now they can actually do that right. So once you leave the house, they turn off the lads and stuff. You don't need voice comment. If you see your reading stuff, they will turn out turn on the less.

S Speaker 125:20Very interesting. And where are you today? What's the traction? Have you had any Lois things like that? Yeah, we,
Very interesting. And where are you today? What's the traction? Have you had any Lois things like that? Yeah, we,

25:39So we had around 30k
S Speaker 225:45cells already just best out. Just by selling this we haven't released pre order for for the flagship one yet. Yeah, it's just gonna take longer to get there, but, but even for this one, we have like 600 pending pre order now that we have a few, and we secured one ROI with
cells already just best out. Just by selling this we haven't released pre order for for the flagship one yet. Yeah, it's just gonna take longer to get there, but, but even for this one, we have like 600 pending pre order now that we have a few, and we secured one ROI with

S Speaker 226:29So this year's DEF CON, they're gonna get hundreds of our device as a badge or developers, yeah, yeah. I mean a lot of traction from from just this we are planning to release, like a like I mentioned, launch another one with cm five that we think gonna sell. Well, we're still thinking if we should do Kickstarter or
So this year's DEF CON, they're gonna get hundreds of our device as a badge or developers, yeah, yeah.

S Speaker 229:40like chip makers, like development board companies I visit, model companies, the all the all incapable of building this, like you have to be able to know hardware and also embedded system, also, like AI to be able to build this one thing I feel like, why we only need 2 million because, like me and my co founder, we both speak Chinese. Yeah, it's way, just way easier for us to build stuff like we can build the same stuff like 2020, times cheaper
like chip makers, like development board companies I visit, model companies, the all the all incapable of building this, like you have to be able to know hardware and also embedded system, also, like AI to be able to build this one thing I feel like, why we only need 2 million because, like me and my co founder, we both speak Chinese.

S Speaker 230:18That's what how we feel like the state us, we've realized we just can't. We can spill stuff, like, 10 times better, like, faster than others. So which means the money we have right now, we able to launch product and build product and have factories for us working for us, and
That's what how we feel like the state us, we've realized we just can't. We can spill stuff, like, 10 times better, like, faster than others. So which means the money we have right now, we able to launch product and build product and have factories for us working for us, and
