S Speaker 22:11Yeah, it is at the moment. Look, I've lived here for the last 10 years. Give you a bit of the background story, but yeah, in short, it is today. And even shorter, it's not where it's going to be tomorrow. So we know that we need to tackle the US market. You know, we've approached the Australian investors, and they're the right people to take this globally with us. So I'm waiting for I'm a citizen here, English buy by birth citizen here, I'm waiting for my Aussie passport to land. It's in the post at the moment, then I can apply for the US visa. So I'm heading your way no matter what. Yeah, it's just a case of, it's a case of

S Speaker 12:55when, yeah, that's good to know, Ryan, because we are a global fund, but we don't have mandates to invest in Australian based companies, so I just wanted to get that out of the way at the same time, Ryan, I'm not sure if Luke passed this or not, our check sizes might be slightly larger for the current round that you're raising. We I'll give you a fund overview. But just for this, we invest anywhere from two to $15 million with a sweet spot of roughly being five to seven, we have done, say, early stage $2 million checks and seed rounds, but, but going below that would really not move the needle for the team. I still wanted to have a chat Ryan, because this is super interesting. As you may be aware, Qualcomm has recently launched its own inference chips and data center is a space that we actively want to look at. So wanted to understand that front and what you're building, how you're thinking about it, how the next few milestones look like for you. And at the same time, I have a chat internally and see if there are any partnership propositions I'd love to sort of keep a track on them. Awesome.

S Speaker 24:00Yeah, that sounds great. And I appreciate you putting the cards on the table. You know, we're publicly what we're saying is we're raising a million USD Now, the reason for that is we originally started at 3 million the I don't know what you know about the Aussie VC market, but I'll say small fish, small pond is the way I'd approach it. They have a very set view on what pre seed should be, almost what seed should be, and the financial thresholds are considerably lower than the US. So we've, we've had our dreams watered down for the earlier phases just to fit the Aussie model. I got to the point where I've realized, okay, they're not the people for us. We cannot have this limited. The more we raise, the more we achieve. So, yeah, you'll see on the pitch deck, it says a mill, yeah. But we literally had a conversation with the team this morning, and it is purely a case of, you know, the. The better we are funded, the quicker we achieve our goals with what we're doing. So music to my ears in terms of where you are, in terms of, you know, your preferred points, but also the entry point as well.

S Speaker 25:21Look, if, if, if you like what we're doing. And you said, Ryan, being on plane tomorrow, I've got my passport in my bag, and off I go. It's both an exaggeration, but the reality, yeah, so I've already moved from one side of the world to the other, going a quarter of the way to the US is, is nothing. When I was there, I was scoping out areas to live at, property prices, and figuring out which of my team I would pull over, as well how we would structure all of that sort of stuff. I know we need an LLC, you know, so we'll get everything set up and do all of that. My previous consultancy, I expanded that to the US before covid as well. So I know I'm getting into lived it, lived it before. I've done the traveling backwards and forwards.

S Speaker 16:15Makes sense. Makes sense, Ryan, so I can quickly get back to you on that once we have this conversation, we have one partner in the team called Varsha. She, she's the person leading the entire data center focus. I work directly with her for any anything around the data center tech stack. So so would have a chat with that, with her, come back to you quickly on where we stand the business proposition, like the partnerships and any sort of go, go to market, could take time, but, but I'll keep you posted on those as well.

S Speaker 26:48Yeah, great. You know, these data centers aren't built in a day, but we're looking for the right people to join us on this journey. Because what, what we're trying to do is like, completely transform an entire industry in infrastructure as a whole. We're not a component part that's going to be plugged in. And when you get an incremental shift, there's a ton of those plays out there, and I'm sure you get many of them land on your desk every single week. But this is a redefinition of how infrastructure operates, so we need the right

S Speaker 210:05Yeah, cool. Well, that's good to know. Well, look, I'll the main thing about me, and where I always start this conversation is with sport. So I grew up in professional sports environment. I played football for Norwich, proper football, English football, for nine years. So from seven till 16,

S Speaker 210:32So my child was very different. You know, once my friends were out partying and hanging out with girls, I was at the training ground, in the gym, on the physio table, in the ice bath, and traveling the country and just living a very structured and different life to everyone else. So I worked it out the other day. It was actually there was a full time job on top of school that I had to, had to manage from a very young age. It showed me, you know, I already had a lot of drive and ambition, but it showed me that there was more to life than what my town could offer. And I'm not from a small place on the east coast of England, you know, where there's very little opportunity and even less ambition. So I was desperate to get out. Cricket was the first route out. So we had an Aussie pro come over and play for our club. And I was 16 at the time. I hadn't finished my exams, and we were sat at tea one day and he said he's like, you know, it'd be the best thing for your cricket. And it was like, Come and play for us in the close season. I sat there like thought for all of two seconds. I was like, All right, I'll do it. Finished the game, went home to my mom, so 16, and said to her mom, I'm going Australia. And said to her men, she said, Are you Yeah, how you going to do that? I was like, I don't know, but I'll figure it out. And three months later, I'd finished my exams, and I was on a plane coming over here. Flew over with another lad I played with. He was 18, but it was like I was the parent and he was the kid. I look after him, but we were netting every single day and playing first grade in a very decent competition. I was

And said to her men, she said, Are you Yeah, how you going to do that? I was like, I don't know, but I'll figure it out. And three months later, I'd finished my exams, and I was on a plane coming over here. Flew over with another lad I played with. He was 18, but it was like I was the parent and he was the kid. I look after him, but we were netting every single day and playing first grade in a very decent competition. I was
12:22supposed to be here for six months,
supposed to be here for six months,
supposed to be here for six months,
supposed to be here for six months,
S Speaker 212:25had to go home after three months, which was a shame, but couldn't settle back home. The quickest route for me, I had two choices. It was either university or join the Royal Navy or the forces. And it was quicker for me to join the Navy, and I went in as a clearance driver. And it's the sort of it's the discipline where you get 1000s apply and 10 get selected. And went in loved it was pestering the PT instructor to connect me with the football team they're under eighteens, because I knew they went to Dallas every single year. Got told to come back when I finished my basic training. So the minute the parade finished, I dragged my mum and dad and my ex girlfriend to the to the gym and knocked on the guy's door and he opened up, what do you want? I was like, you've told me that you would connect me when I finished, I finished, and he's like, mate, come on, just relax. And I was like, no, no, no, you told me. And it was a good job, because, you know, this was sort of midday, by two o'clock, he got a response back, and they had a game on the Tuesday, so I had to travel from one side of England to the other for this game. I turned up there. They said, Look, no pressure. The team is selected for Dallas, but enjoy today. I'm an ex midfielder who doesn't like to run too much, so I play in defense, and I scored after about two minutes, and that's a rare occurrence for me. And went in after the game, and they pulled me out of the change room and said, Hey, would you like to come to Dallas with us? So some poor guy in that changing room had been measured up for his suit and given his bag and everything, and he got pulled out for me to come in, the poor guy, but I joined the squad and captained the Royal Navy under 18 over in the US, and that's one of them, incredible opportunity, real privilege. And was offered trials off the back of that one in Toronto, one in Atlanta. So I had a choice to make. You know, do I give football one last shot? Was the fittest ever been. So I was like, you know, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna give it a go, and left with the Navy's blessing. I got injured, never made it out there. So, you know, following that, I had a 10 year, almost a 10 year semi pro football career. I. I'm playing a decent standard, but, you know, not the levels that I should have done because work got involved. Also played semi pro cricket, which was fantastic. And, yeah, my best mate called me back. He called me one day. I was 10 days away from going back in the Navy, and he played for our local rivals with football, and he just said, look, they want to sign you. They'll give you a career. Will you have a conversation and a deep breath? Sort of picture of myself floating around in the North Sea in the middle of winter, versus some exotic project somewhere else in the world. And it was an easy decision. So I went and met the manager, was offered four different career paths, and took his advice to become a planning engineer, which was, I knew what his words meant in terms of sort of basic English, but I had no idea what the day to day was, and then trusted his judgment. And so that was where I started my journey. And a planning engineer is responsible for time on a project, so we look after the Gantt chart, but time is related to cost, to contract quality, to risk, to constructability and design and all that sort of stuff. So a really incredible moment and piece of advice from Nick, the manager there and the club was associated with oil and gas as an industry, so it gave me a real opportunity to then go and succeed. From there, I had a game plan I had to do two years in the yard, wearing overalls and carrying heavy bits of equipment, ready, getting it ready to go offshore. I then moved into the office. And the game plan was three years in the office, two years in London, then go international. And I was looking after I was 20 what between 21 and 24 looking after AmEx, largest portfolio of work with Shell as our client. And there's two and a half million pounds a day, loss of production for every day that this ball rig was shut down, and 500 people working on the job, 250 on the platform and on a barge. 250 flying in my helicopters, and I was responsible for all of the coordination and logistics of that at that age, moved to London. The bright lights were calling and joined a Norwegian company that were reestablishing there. They had 25,000 people in the business. I was the 35th person in London, best company I've ever worked for. Really, really special opportunity. I got headhunted after about 18 months. And, you know, I was still a baby planner at the time, on an okay salary, but this Norwegian competitor came in for me, and they offered four and a half times my salary to move over to Norway. And it's like, you know, when things are going good, like it amplifies, doesn't it, a lot of the time. And I took the offer into my boss, Steve, at the time, I was like, Steve, I'm so sorry, but I've been offered this. And he let back in his chair. He was like, shit, you've got to take this. I know, but I really don't want to. Is there a conversation we can have? He went straight out of his office. He took the took the letter, and went to his boss, who read London and said, Eric, we need to keep right. Can you fix this? Within 24 hours, we had opportunities come through from Brazil, which sounded fantastic, Aberdeen, which sounded awful, Oslo and Malaysia Oslo said that they would match the package and sort of true to form for me, when things felt right, I'll make a quick decision. Shook their hands and a couple of weeks later, packed up my life in London and back home because I was still traveling backwards and forced to play sport, relocated to Oslo and was thrown onto an r&d project for a bit. There was then there was a job that was in a bit of distress. They needed some horsepower behind it. And I went in to look after sort of two out of the 10 work packages reporting into a lead planning engineer. And after two weeks of that, she called me into a meeting room and said, Hey, I actually think you'd be better in my position and I'd be better in yours. Do you want to switch young, dumb, naive but enthusiastic? Was like, Yeah, of course. Like, what could go wrong?
had to go home after three months, which was a shame, but couldn't settle back home. The quickest route for me, I had two choices. It was either university or join the Royal Navy or the forces. And it was quicker for me to join the Navy, and I went in as a clearance driver. And it's the sort of it's the discipline where you get 1000s apply and 10 get selected.

S Speaker 222:13and then a month later, I got a phone call saying, hey, we need you back in London. No, I'd given the London office my word that when they called I would go.

S Speaker 222:37I said, Look, I'll be good to my work, because we can't be good to our word. What do we have? And they said, Yep, we'll see you in a month. So back, I went, did a year's return of service there, got back with an ex girlfriend, because there's always a girl in these stories as well. And we sold our houses in the UK, and she had a business that we'd set up for her as well. And the game plan was to meet in Australia. She was going to go traveling. That was almost 23rd of December. It'll be 10 years that I got here. Had a really poor time with recruiters and consultancies and joined the government to start off with. So going from a real high velocity tendering environment to government was a shock to the system. Did nine months with that. Joined a consultancy because I thought the grass was greener. Didn't like how both organizations were behaving in terms of their values and ethics and how they treated taxpayer dollars, so I started writing a business plan. It was either a case of shut up and deal with it, just just deal with my own frustrations, or do something about it. And you probably get the sense from the monolog that you've had for the last couple of minutes, but, but also the sportsman in me, I the flight is not an option for me. It's a tackle, fix, head on.

And you probably get the sense from the monolog that you've had for the last couple of minutes, but, but also the sportsman in me, I the flight is not an option for me. It's a tackle, fix, head on.
I said, Look, I'll be good to my work, because we can't be good to our word. What do we have? And they said, Yep, we'll see you in a month. So back, I went, did a year's return of service there, got back with an ex girlfriend, because there's always a girl in these stories as well. And we sold our houses in the UK, and she had a business that we'd set up for her as well. And the game plan was to meet in Australia. She was going to go traveling. That was almost 23rd of December. It'll be 10 years that I got here. Had a really poor time with recruiters and consultancies and joined the government to start off with. So going from a real high velocity tendering environment to government was a shock to the system. Did nine months with that. Joined a consultancy because I thought the grass was greener. Didn't like how both organizations were behaving in terms of their values and ethics and how they treated taxpayer dollars, so I started writing a business plan. It was either a case of shut up and deal with it, just just deal with my own frustrations, or do something about it. And you probably get the sense from the monolog that you've had for the last couple of minutes, but, but also the sportsman in me, I the flight is not an option for me. It's a tackle, fix, head on.
24:13So that was nine ish years ago.
So that was nine ish years ago.
So that was nine ish years ago.
So that was nine ish years ago.
S Speaker 224:19I grew and scaled that business. It was my first business. I went in for a six month contract, and at the end of that six months, we, I, you know, won the trust of the government organization we're delivering to. And, yeah, we won four major tenders in one day, and suddenly it was, you know, a million plus dollar business, which, you know, I was building the plane. Whilst I was flying, it grew and scaled that to a couple of million revenue. We had three different service offerings. Underneath that, I expanded the business to the US, Hawaii, then Chicago, prior to covid and. And then we contracted down with with covid, and had worked for, you know, some of the biggest names in construction over here, at some international firms as well. So yeah, state government, local government, major tier one construction companies, and delivered some of the biggest projects in in Australia. And you know, at that point, I've been rolled back a couple of years. I'd been tendering for about 1010, years at that point, and I love that part of the job, because it's the only time where you truly get the opportunity to to change, like the success of the of a project like you can, there's often nothing that is off limits. So you know, you can charter an Anton off jet, if you've got the budget too and things like that. You can, you can do some really special things. But it was cost of a bypass. So northern New South Wales, I was working on the contractor side, and normally I only get pulled in when a project is struggling or if there's a lot of risk. And this was a billion and a half dollar project, 10 kilometers long, highway, three massive tunnels, 50 bridges, like really complex job, plan, I had two months to analyze, which was ended up being 250 different documents, 5000 pages of data, extract all of the key information from it and into what ended up being 66 different spreadsheets, and then transform that information into a 13,000 line item schedule. So if you imagine a spreadsheet with 13,000 rows of data, 20 columns of metadata, and every row is connected to at least one predecessor and one successor. That was my world and our starting work at 6am finishing at 3am just over and over and over it, in all honesty, I broke like you. You cannot sustain that level for any period of time, and I've seen far too many friends and colleagues in a similar position. So I'd have a look at myself. I still had the hunger, I still wanted to grow the business, but I recognized that working 100 plus hours every single week wasn't the way to do it, and technology was the only answer. So we started with some, this is in the consultants, and we started with some dashboarding solutions. So we were selling that to couple of the government organizations. But then, you know, I kind of woke up one day and I was like, this isn't it's not defendable. We're a developer away from being redundant. And started to look at what my actual issues were on that job and throughout my career, and and it was, how do we get all of this data that's locked up in the drawings, the models, the text reports into a usable format so that someone like me can come along and add value to it. And so that's, that's me. That's the origin story to lumiate and how we came to be talking into that.

S Speaker 128:18That's, that's incredible, Ryan, you've jumped around so much, and I haven't seen myself, personally, haven't seen so much in life. But one thing I know for sure is every time you sort of pack your bags, change your life, you grow a level in creativity, for sure, and then completely changes you. So that's that's an incredible story, for sure, right? I'd love to understand the product a little bit. You mentioned the problem statement and how you were feeling it personally as well.

It to me, you mentioned pre construction. You plan to expand into post construction, but just the pre construction part seems like say a one off usage rather than subscription model is would you? Would you like to challenge that?

37:57Yeah, so benchmarking
Yeah, so benchmarking
Yeah, so benchmarking
Yeah, so benchmarking
S Speaker 238:00is definitely more prevalent in the earlier stages, but you do still benchmark throughout the job. These jobs move through different gates, and at each gate you need to sense check it to make sure that you're you know where you need to be the data now that that's our entry point into some organizations. Once we get past benchmarking, you actually start working with detailed construction data, which is what we're looking at here. Now this data gets updated between 15 and 30 times on a typical project, and I'm talking major updates, milestone updates, rather than day to day changes, and this is where I said earlier, every time this data gets updated, it can cost up to half a million dollars to extract the data again, to build the schedule, to build the estimate using it. So this is where the projects, they span multi years, and they have multiple data updates. So it lends itself quite nicely to a subscription model, because the customers don't necessarily know the quantum of how much that change is going to be, and they just want to be able to call on it all without having the complexity of a new commercial discussion. So subscription suits this perfectly. There'll be some form of consumption play like a platform access fee, and it might be a case of Microsoft. You're working on 100 jobs this year. We know roughly how much it would cost you to do this work, and we will provide this platform to you at 80% discount, as an arbitrary number to what the current cost is. So just concentrate some time. So what you're seeing here, this is the takeoff solution to the data extraction piece, and this is what we're using with customers at the moment. This is where the pilots are. I'm showing you road pavement drawings, as opposed to structural steel, just because it's more visible. You. But all these colored boxes on here, everything you see on each of these pages that's got colored box, the AI agents have analyzed it and provided a response. So on this page here, you know, it's about capturing these eight different individual drawings and committing it to our database on the right hand side ready, so it can be used later, and the same story with the plan. So this is a bird's eye view. The other ones were a side on view. So in this just five pages alone, we've got three different types of key data. So top down, side on and detail. This is from a project that was 100 million there was about 40 odd pages on the big Coffs harbor job that I told you about. There was 200 pages of just this type, just this discipline. So each sector has roughly 20 different disciplines underneath it. This is just one discipline, right? The next step then is we look at each of those screenshots individually. So if we take this one here, a quantity surveyor, an engineer, needs to analyze all of this information and extract it so it can be used in a bit. So these people, you know, in Sydney, at the moment, a quantity surveyor is getting paid about 140,000 Australian a year to do this work. Now, if we zoom in on this a little bit here, so the top layer is AC 14, that's the material, and the thickness is 50 millimeters. If we look in the right hand side here, ac 1450, millimeters. And this is captured in seconds, if not minutes, right? Really, really quick and quite, you know, accurate and reliable. If it's not quite right, it's very easy for the user to just click on it, and then they can change the values of of the output within the tool. So very easy for the user to review, customize and approve the data once, once it's been produced by the AI. So this is the thickness. We'll now look at the area, thickness times area gives you volume. Now this, this is the page where it becomes really clear on the value of what we're doing. So what I should said earlier this process, this data extraction, the quantity takeoff, this is the foundation of every single project. So the data that is produced as a result of doing this underpins every project on this planet. There is no exception, that data drives, schedule, estimate, risk, procurement, everything downstream. If you get this wrong, your project will fail, and it happens for 98% of jobs. Now, for this page alone, this is about four hours work for an experienced Qs to come along.

Now this data gets updated between 15 and 30 times on a typical project, and I'm talking major updates, milestone updates, rather than day to day changes, and this is where I said earlier, every time this data gets updated, it can cost up to half a million dollars to extract the data again, to build the schedule, to build the estimate using it. So this is where the projects, they span multi years, and they have multiple data updates. So it lends itself quite nicely to a subscription model, because the customers don't necessarily know the quantum of how much that change is going to be, and they just want to be able to call on it all without having the complexity of a new commercial discussion. So subscription suits this perfectly. There'll be some form of consumption play like a platform access fee, and it might be a case of Microsoft. You're working on 100 jobs this year. We know roughly how much it would cost you to do this work, and we will provide this platform to you at 80% discount, as an arbitrary number to what the current cost is. So just concentrate some time. So what you're seeing here, this is the takeoff solution to the data extraction piece, and this is what we're using with customers at the moment. This is where the pilots are. I'm showing you road pavement drawings, as opposed to structural steel, just because it's more visible. You. But all these colored boxes on here, everything you see on each of these pages that's got colored box, the AI agents have analyzed it and provided a response. So on this page here, you know, it's about capturing these eight different individual drawings and committing it to our database on the right hand side ready, so it can be used later, and the same story with the plan. So this is a bird's eye view. The other ones were a side on view. So in this just five pages alone, we've got three different types of key data. So top down, side on and detail. This is from a project that was 100 million there was about 40 odd pages on the big Coffs harbor job that I told you about. There was 200 pages of just this type, just this discipline. So each sector has roughly 20 different disciplines underneath it. This is just one discipline, right? The next step then is we look at each of those screenshots individually. So if we take this one here, a quantity surveyor, an engineer, needs to analyze all of this information and extract it so it can be used in a bit. So these people, you know, in Sydney, at the moment, a quantity surveyor is getting paid about 140,000 Australian a year to do this work. Now, if we zoom in on this a little bit here, so the top layer is AC 14, that's the material, and the thickness is 50 millimeters. If we look in the right hand side here, ac 1450, millimeters. And this is captured in seconds, if not minutes, right? Really, really quick and quite, you know, accurate and reliable. If it's not quite right, it's very easy for the user to just click on it, and then they can change the values of of the output within the tool. So very easy for the user to review, customize and approve the data once, once it's been produced by the AI. So this is the thickness. We'll now look at the area, thickness times area gives you volume. Now this, this is the page where it becomes really clear on the value of what we're doing. So what I should said earlier this process, this data extraction, the quantity takeoff, this is the foundation of every single project. So the data that is produced as a result of doing this underpins every project on this planet. There is no exception, that data drives, schedule, estimate, risk, procurement, everything downstream. If you get this wrong, your project will fail, and it happens for 98% of jobs. Now, for this page alone, this is about four hours work for an experienced Qs to come along.

S Speaker 145:34hope it all makes sense. Yes, super interesting, for sure. I wasn't aware of the scale of the problem, which is pretty interesting. We do plan to track a few spaces like this, underserved industries which don't seem to be the most hottest application of AI, but still make the most sense ROI wise, and it seems like one of those industries, for sure. I may have a lot of questions for you ran. I'll have to do a little bit of digging on my end as well, and I'll come back to you over email with some questions, and we can, we can have that discussion async, from an investment standpoint, again, ran, seems like it might be around early for us, but I'll have that chat internally. I'll get back to you very quickly. I don't want to waste your time as well. And let's, let's take it from there.

S Speaker 246:20Yeah, I appreciate it. And, you know, look, we, we've got a pilot with Microsoft, we've got a proposal in with AWS. We actually held a kickoff workshop with them. We've got a proposal in with ESR, the largest industrial developer in APAC, and we're in discussions with Jacobs as well, the largest data center engineering company. I mean, they do all types of engineering, but so, you know this, this is the solution for this problem. Yeah, there's absolutely no doubt of that in my mind. And you know, construction as a whole is the second biggest industry in the world. It's Whoever joins us on the journey. It's an incredible opportunity, even if it's early. But we have a real, special chance to capture this entire we're creating our own opportunity here. It just doesn't exist. So whoever gets there first, they do something really special.

S Speaker 247:39How it's both. So, you know, year one where we're more narrow, but yes, it's expansion in the value that we bring, and the time and cost saving that we provide, and the increase in accuracy that we can guarantee for them. So as we bring in that. Pricing is exactly what we did for AWS that was just based on the data extraction piece. Yeah, that's without schedule. That's without estimate. So yeah, the size of the opportunity for us is incredible because they're already spending millions and millions and millions and millions of dollars on expensive people like me to come along and do this work
