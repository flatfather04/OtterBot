S Speaker 10:00The head of Qualcomm ventures globally. So we with a corporate venture arm for Qualcomm around for 25 years, investing around the Qualcomm ecosystem, mostly on companies that could leverage Qualcomm's technology and their products, or partners we can go to market together, yeah. So if you look at our portfolio, semi is actually a lot of people think we invest in a lot of semi. We actually don't invest in a lot of semiconductor companies, because we have a very big product portfolio ourselves, sure, and we're more interested in finding use cases, applications for our technology or the chips we're building. Yeah, versus investing semiconductor company now doesn't mean we don't invest at all. It just means we got to invest in things that we're not developing ourselves. Does not have overlap with our products and in markets maybe we're interested in further down the road.

S Speaker 11:34it. Let me just so there's just a couple of maybe background questions. Sounds like too sure I'm priyeshu. Talk to the team a while back. Where is this company, roughly at in commercialization, they're still pretty early stage. Sounds like series A they're raising, how much they raise? Where you guys are in the process of this fundraise?

S Speaker 21:55Sure. Yeah, so maybe I can chat through that, and Chris can find, find the deck. So these guys, they're raising series A they are on track to get to a million physical qubits by 2029 and so that's similar to what other quantum firms are targeting and and what I would say about why they're kind of at the series a space is that they're really able to leverage that semiconductor like the work that's been done in the semiconductor market in terms of manufacturing,
Sure. Yeah, so maybe I can chat through that, and Chris can find, find the deck.

S Speaker 22:45scalable on CMOs and in other types of quantum means some, some is more scalable On CMOS than others, but there's probably only, only electrons on helium and silicon spin that are truly 100% scalable on CMOS. And while other types of quantum including like photonics, there's some aspects that are scalable on CMOS, but there's other pieces of it that aren't and they are going to require interconnects that have not been invented yet. They're going to require capital equipment that's not been invented and processes, whereas these guys their solution, which we'll walk through in a few minutes, is completely scalable on CMOS. And so the amount of capital, and to some extent, time that's required in order to get there, is much, much more modest. So

S Speaker 24:08I think it's just been about 15 million that's gone in to the company thus far, and they've been able to accomplish a fair bit with that. And some, you know, granted, some of that has come from long standing University relationships and research that was done by the founders, you know, in in in the universities, and those, those papers have been published. And a lot of the work that they've, they've done over decades, is is applicable here with the company, at $30 gives them runway for a little more than three years, which you know, given their their sort of time horizon. It does give them cushion around hitting the milestones that they've proposed in this deck. Okay,

S Speaker 25:3514 to 15? They do. You know, part of this, this series, A will go to increase that team. They think they need to double in size for the work that they need to do. And so the use of proceeds for for arrow Q is they need additional dilution fridges, and they need people
14 to 15? They do. You know, part of this, this series, A will go to increase that team. They think they need to double in size for the work that they need to do. And so the use of proceeds for for arrow Q is they need additional dilution fridges, and they need people

S Speaker 16:00got Okay, and then just looking at a timeline in the deck, you said earlier, looks like they want to tape out a 10,000 qBiD chip in about 21 months from Series A. So whenever series A gets done, let's call it September, and September, it'd be 21 month. 21 months, kind of a funny number, but whatever. Yeah,
got Okay, and then just looking at a timeline in the deck, you said earlier, looks like they want to tape out a 10,000 qBiD chip in about 21 months from Series A.

6:33that's their their estimation. Yeah.
that's their their estimation. Yeah.
that's their their estimation. Yeah.
that's their their estimation. Yeah.
S Speaker 16:36Okay, got it. So that's when they're going to take body chip, right, right? And this will be taping out where, like, they have a foundry identified as TSMC,
Okay, got it. So that's when they're going to take body chip, right, right? And this will be taping out where, like, they have a foundry identified as TSMC,
Okay, got it. So that's when they're going to take body chip, right, right? And this will be taping out where, like, they have a foundry identified as TSMC,
Okay, got it. So that's when they're going to take body chip, right, right? And this will be taping out where, like, they have a foundry identified as TSMC,
S Speaker 26:46they've been using wonder lake, or, sorry for their wonder Lake chip, so they have taped out a chip already that they, they used as a test chip. And, and, and they, they did that at Sky water. So it's not even a very sophisticated foundry.
they've been using wonder lake, or, sorry for their wonder Lake chip, so they have taped out a chip already that they, they used as a test chip. And, and, and they, they did that at Sky water. So it's not even a very sophisticated foundry.

7:04They believe that sky water, so,
They believe that sky water, so,
They believe that sky water, so,
They believe that sky water, so,
7:12yeah, okay, the lower end of foundries.
yeah, okay, the lower end of foundries.
yeah, okay, the lower end of foundries.
yeah, okay, the lower end of foundries.
S Speaker 27:17And they believe that they can, they can also use sky water for the 10,000 cubit chip. Subsequent chips will probably need a little bit of a more sophisticated boundary. They're kind of thinking it's in that they need sort of 22 nanometer
And they believe that they can, they can also use sky water for the 10,000 cubit chip. Subsequent chips will probably need a little bit of a more sophisticated boundary. They're kind of thinking it's in that they need sort of 22 nanometer

7:38capability for what they want to do
capability for what they want to do
capability for what they want to do
capability for what they want to do
S Speaker 17:41so right now. The target for this chip, the whatever, this 10,000 cubic chip, that's what, what technology you know they're targeting for that chip. Um,
so right now. The target for this chip, the whatever, this 10,000 cubic chip, that's what, what technology you know they're targeting for that chip. Um,
so right now. The target for this chip, the whatever, this 10,000 cubic chip, that's what, what technology you know they're targeting for that chip. Um,
so right now. The target for this chip, the whatever, this 10,000 cubic chip, that's what, what technology you know they're targeting for that chip. Um,
S Speaker 27:57I don't have that at my fingertips. I don't remember which one they use. They view this, yeah, they view this chip as as sort of an intermediate quantum step, like it may be able to do some things, but the focus is for to get, to get the gates working, and to, you know, sort of do do all the testing that they need to do, yeah, in order to move to the, you know, the chip that's actually going to be commercial.
I don't have that at my fingertips. I don't remember which one they use.

S Speaker 18:25Got it. Okay, got it. And do they have any, you know, there's a lot of work going on in some of the big companies, like Microsoft, Google and so forth. Have they talked to any of those guys from, you know, potential partner standpoint, or anything that sort
Got it. Okay, got it. And do they have any, you know, there's a lot of work going on in some of the big companies, like Microsoft, Google and so forth. Have they talked to any of those guys from, you know, potential partner standpoint, or anything that sort
Got it. Okay, got it. And do they have any, you know, there's a lot of work going on in some of the big companies, like Microsoft, Google and so forth. Have they talked to any of those guys from, you know, potential partner standpoint, or anything that sort

S Speaker 28:44Yes. So So
8:49Microsoft and IBM
S Speaker 28:56open to speaking with other quantum firms, so they will not invest and, and,
open to speaking with other quantum firms, so they will not invest and, and,
open to speaking with other quantum firms, so they will not invest and, and,
open to speaking with other quantum firms, so they will not invest and, and,
S Speaker 19:05um, why that's not, well, I mean, they've invested in, like, Psych quantum, and there's a announcement, at least from Microsoft with the atom computing, for instance,
um, why that's not, well, I mean, they've invested in, like, Psych quantum, and there's a announcement, at least from Microsoft with the atom computing, for instance,
um, why that's not, well, I mean, they've invested in, like, Psych quantum, and there's a announcement, at least from Microsoft with the atom computing, for instance,
um, why that's not, well, I mean, they've invested in, like, Psych quantum, and there's a announcement, at least from Microsoft with the atom computing, for instance,
S Speaker 29:17Right? Yeah. So, so, I mean, IBM is that they don't invest in other quantum firms. Microsoft is, is creating some, some partnerships and, and you know what these guys are doing, being CMOS based is quite different from the Microsoft proposals. In and their partnership, okay, okay. Like the folks that, like, you know, the folks that are interested in this are folks that really understand chips,
Right? Yeah. So, so, I mean, IBM is that they don't invest in other quantum firms. Microsoft is, is creating some, some partnerships and, and you know what these guys are doing, being CMOS based is quite different from the Microsoft proposals. In and their partnership, okay, okay.

Like the folks that, like, you know, the folks that are interested in this are folks that really understand chips,
S Speaker 19:54yeah, okay. And where, where are you guys in the fundraise process to starting when, when is the target to get term sheets or whatever.
yeah, okay. And where, where are you guys in the fundraise process to starting when, when is the target to get term sheets or whatever.
yeah, okay. And where, where are you guys in the fundraise process to starting when, when is the target to get term sheets or whatever.
yeah, okay. And where, where are you guys in the fundraise process to starting when, when is the target to get term sheets or whatever.
S Speaker 210:02So we are, we're looking for a lead, and so we're kind of focused on firms that can, can lead around. And you know, we've also got some firms that are interested in in participating, until we find sort of lead investors. You know, we won't go out with the participation like, we're not super focused on the participation side. So looking for a lead investor, you know, timeline, we've kind of just been getting started this summer, so we haven't, sort of, we haven't nailed it down yet, but in the coming months,
So we are, we're looking for a lead, and so we're kind of focused on firms that can, can lead around.

S Speaker 310:44months, they were raising 3035 last November, I'm guessing that round didn't happen, right?
months, they were raising 3035 last November, I'm guessing that round didn't happen, right?

10:51No, this is, this is was
No, this is, this is was
No, this is, this is was
No, this is, this is was
S Speaker 111:11it okay. And then, just for my information, maybe this seems like a pretty small capital raise, but is this like you got you guys would take on these kind of smaller raises, typically, banks want to, you know, take on big capital raises. But I don't know where sweet sweet spot is,
it okay. And then, just for my information, maybe this seems like a pretty small capital raise, but is this like you got you guys would take on these kind of smaller raises, typically, banks want to, you know, take on big capital raises. But I don't know where sweet sweet spot is,

S Speaker 211:30yeah, I mean, we're, I would say Key Bank does take on sort of smaller middle market type of of transactions. Um, this one, you know, I personally really liked, because of the just being able to leverage CMOs and it, it's sort of, it's definitely got a semiconductor bent to it. So, you know, part of it is, I like, I really think that these guys are, are a winner here.

S Speaker 312:22I mean, the key over here, from our conversations last time was, I guess, since November, what what's been the progress, which is what's been, what's been, something that they've proven, I think in their technology room, right? Remember, they were going for for physical qubids, that map really well to logical qubit. So which is, you don't need a lot of error correction. And then they wanted to prove that out first, which is, they can create one of that and then scale from there, which their claim was that if they're able to put that out, then they can scale to a million qubits,

S Speaker 313:11and then where we were is last year, because there's a lot of different approaches to like psi, quantum has a different approach. Atom computing has a different has a different everybody who's got a different approach. We weren't sure whether how to really assess that this approach is going to work, so we said, Okay, let them prove that out. First initial So has that proof point? What's been the proof point, and what's the point today? And then where do they go from here?

S Speaker 213:45Like, yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, perfect. So, so at the bottom of this page, overall, the page, you know, highlights, sort of some of the the accomplishments that they've made as of now, and to sharp most, most likely where, what's new for you is this quantum entanglement. And so they were able to demonstrate an electron on helium qubit entangle, entanglement with a readout circuit. So they actually, and there's a what I can do is I can send you, there's a memo that they've drafted on this. It does say, it does say confidential on it, but what they've told us is that it's they're okay with us sharing it, so long as it doesn't get to the press, because they're in process of publishing the paper. And so I guess that's a sensitive point when, when you're going to go to publish, but they're they're fine with investors seeing this memo that demonstrates the electrons on helium qubit entanglement with the readout circuit. And so that's sort of the foundation for them of getting to spin cubits and moving to the next, their next phase of developing the chip, the chip. And so their next stage is so they've got, they'll have a chip. They're going to integrate some micro magnets onto that chip so that they can control the spin of their electrons, because they want to be they're going to use the electron spin as their qubit.
Like, yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, perfect.

S Speaker 216:01And then once they've got got that in place, they're going to build their their two qubit gate, which is like, it's a very it's a simple gate. It's just bringing electrons close together to perform gate operations. And there's lots of papers on these sorts of gates that have been produced before. So they're just sort of taking, they're at the stage now where they're taking pieces of things that have been done before and incorporating them into their into the chip. And so there's some really good I'll send you some material afterwards on this accomplishment in particular, and then they have some work that's very good, I think, does a really good job of showing all the different sort of types of quantum hardware and the pros and cons of each, which I think is pretty

S Speaker 217:37yes experts, yeah. That's yeah, that makes sense, and that's what, what folks have been doing. So what we'll do is we'll, if you want to provide some availability for the team that you have, and then we'll line up Nick and Johanna, so you know, and also Steve Lyon,
yes experts, yeah. That's yeah, that makes sense, and that's what, what folks have been doing. So what we'll do is we'll, if you want to provide some availability for the team that you have, and then we'll line up Nick and Johanna, so you know, and also Steve Lyon,

Sure, yeah, that makes sense. Yeah,
Sure, yeah, that makes sense. Yeah,
S Speaker 118:33sounds good. I think that's yeah best for Nate to tell us, like, what? What are the next key technology milestones? They try and prove out how long it's gonna take to get there, like this. There's two cubic gates like
sounds good. I think that's yeah best for Nate to tell us, like, what? What are the next key technology milestones? They try and prove out how long it's gonna take to get there, like this. There's two cubic gates like
