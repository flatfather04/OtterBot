S Speaker 11:39So Do I have your permission to be honest here? Yes,
So Do I have your permission to be honest here? Yes,
So Do I have your permission to be honest here? Yes,
So Do I have your permission to be honest here? Yes,
1:43please. Yeah, that's, that's exactly what we expect.
please. Yeah, that's, that's exactly what we expect.
please. Yeah, that's, that's exactly what we expect.
please. Yeah, that's, that's exactly what we expect.
S Speaker 14:44Yeah, okay, so now that I have that information, so here are, here are two ways you can actually if I were right now, Akanksha, this is the only two options I can think of. Okay. Number one, she has to go through her own battle. Do the F 1b like, do the graduate, and then go for like, you know, continue working on OPD, stem, O, PT, and then aim to get an H 1b and H 1b is a exit strategy out of this thing, this thing, what she's doing, right? Yeah, yeah, especially during the three year, left, interim, right. Okay, that's number one strategy. So basically, we just have to suck it up and not be able to travel to India. Number two is, let's say, Okay, let's say she's currently working. She can go to India, and she can apply for that f1 visa, but if she gets rejected, yeah, let me complete that thought. Yeah, you're an f1 visa. You go to India, you go, you go and
Yeah, okay, so now that I have that information, so here are, here are two ways you can actually if I were right now, Akanksha, this is the only two options I can think of. Okay.

Yeah, you're an f1 visa. You go to India, you go, you go and
5:46you go and apply for that
you go and apply for that
you go and apply for that
you go and apply for that
S Speaker 15:51f1 visa. If you get rejected, then you have to apply for an h4 visa and come back to us on an h4 visa, yes, okay, yeah, that's the second so you are able to come back into America, and once you come back, then you have to go back to f1 visa. So you'll have to do another change of status, like you did for f2 you do another change of status, and then you get back onto f1 Yeah, but remember, anytime you get back onto f1 your travel becomes problem because f1 is not getting
f1 visa. If you get rejected, then you have to apply for an h4 visa and come back to us on an h4 visa, yes, okay, yeah, that's the second so you are able to come back into America, and once you come back, then you have to go back to f1 visa.

But I, if I you were to ask me, what is the probability I would say less than 10% right? Yeah, because I don't have any powerful justification for what. Why am I doing a Masters, especially from Humphrey,

right and restart my course and everything
right and restart my course and everything
right and restart my course and everything
S Speaker 18:08don't restart. You can just continue from where you are, okay? But then the problem is, remember one for you to get. Opt anytime you have to complete at least one year of study only, then you get, if you have six months of study left, you complete your masters, you don't get op
don't restart. You can just continue from where you are, okay? But then the problem is, remember one for you to get. Opt anytime you have to complete at least one year of study only, then you get, if you have six months of study left, you complete your masters, you don't get op

8:25okay. But Omkar, like
okay. But Omkar, like
okay. But Omkar, like
okay. But Omkar, like
S Speaker 28:28as of now, I think I'll utilize my CPT these two years. CPT for my job, so I won't have any OPD option after six, no, because if you have a good job in Europe,
as of now, I think I'll utilize my CPT these two years. CPT for my job, so I won't have any OPD option after six, no, because if you have a good job in Europe,
as of now, I think I'll utilize my CPT these two years. CPT for my job, so I won't have any OPD option after six, no, because if you have a good job in Europe,
as of now, I think I'll utilize my CPT these two years. CPT for my job, so I won't have any OPD option after six, no, because if you have a good job in Europe,
S Speaker 38:44so Omkar, say, we go for the option two that you suggested, and we, if not, this December, maybe sometime mid next year, maybe next December, whenever we travel back to India, we try to get an f1 stamped. If that does not happen. We shift to h4 because of this shift, she will have to lose her job, I assume, because her work permit would go away. But then after she comes back and shifts again to f1 will that through a change of status? Will that be a problem for ucis to approve like Will they raise an eyebrow on that?
so Omkar, say, we go for the option two that you suggested, and we, if not, this December, maybe sometime mid next year, maybe next December, whenever we travel back to India, we try to get an f1 stamped.

S Speaker 19:23They won't. There's no issues. The only problem is, if you go next year, yeah, she's going to be very close to ending her course, yeah. So she's not getting open to your system opening after that, right? So that's a big problem. Number two is core. It will get approved. Change of status gets approved. She just has to, has a have a valid dream, like she went to India, came back and then going back to school with Humphrey, they'll approve it.
They won't. There's no issues. The only problem is, if you go next year, yeah, she's going to be very close to ending her course, yeah.

9:49So Omkar maybe, like
9:52we are located in America, San Francisco,
we are located in America, San Francisco,
we are located in America, San Francisco,
we are located in America, San Francisco,
S Speaker 19:57okay, well, at least that's one good thing, that college is right next to you, not that, yeah, yeah.
okay, well, at least that's one good thing, that college is right next to you, not that, yeah, yeah.
okay, well, at least that's one good thing, that college is right next to you, not that, yeah, yeah.
okay, well, at least that's one good thing, that college is right next to you, not that, yeah, yeah.
S Speaker 310:02So Omkar summarizing, I think what we see is either the options that we have is either take a chance and go try your f1 thing. If that does not happen, break in the job, break in your in the f1 study, and then come back, shift again to f1 and that becomes a pattern every time you have to leave the country. Second would be her trying to get an H 1b herself, which seems a little bit difficult. And third would be me getting an H 1b and then an I 140 and then her transferring to H 4e, A, D, and that could be her exit through this entire thing. So uh,
So Omkar summarizing, I think what we see is either the options that we have is either take a chance and go try your f1 thing.

10:46exactly. So the I agree, I
exactly. So the I agree, I
exactly. So the I agree, I
exactly. So the I agree, I
S Speaker 110:50agree, like the f2 to f1 definitely cuts your travel option. Another thing is guys like drunk just came in into office, not even six months. Yeah. So for these things to calm down, if you notice, it will come down. But it's not happening anytime soon, in next six months to maybe nine months too. But I think by next year, August, it's gonna be pretty chill than what is going right now, because he's gonna get busy or other things. Yeah, there's gonna be bigger thing they gonna go after this is not something. This is only to prove that they did the right decision. People did the right decision by making him the president. That's where I feel like, yes, the conversation I'm hearing, yeah, but it will get chiller. So in India, they might get calmer with interviews and stuff like that, right? We just need a calmer situation, right now, it's too much chaos, like good people are getting rejected in India, so we are not confident of how this will impact you.

That's where I feel like, yes, the conversation I'm hearing, yeah, but it will get chiller. So in India, they might get calmer with interviews and stuff like that, right? We just need a calmer situation, right now, it's too much chaos, like good people are getting rejected in India, so we are not confident of how this will impact you.
agree, like the f2 to f1 definitely cuts your travel option. Another thing is guys like drunk just came in into office, not even six months. Yeah. So for these things to calm down, if you notice, it will come down. But it's not happening anytime soon, in next six months to maybe nine months too. But I think by next year, August, it's gonna be pretty chill than what is going right now, because he's gonna get busy or other things. Yeah, there's gonna be bigger thing they gonna go after this is not something. This is only to prove that they did the right decision. People did the right decision by making him the president.

S Speaker 112:02They get rejected. They usually get rejected. H 1b, is the only safer visa you can go in the third country. And this thing, another thing is, it's just a risk. Now, yeah, look, you can what you can do if you want to do a third country, you can go to Canada, right? Okay, go to Canada. Apply for it. If you get rejected, come back on f2 because your husband has f2 right now. Oh, oh, okay, because till October 1, he has f2 but that's only 30 day mark. After that he's h4 so then if you get rejected, you have to apply in Canada itself for h4 so we are taking too much risk, in my opinion. So if you go after 30 days, okay?
They get rejected. They usually get rejected. H 1b, is the only safer visa you can go in the third country. And this thing, another thing is, it's just a risk.

But I need an H 1b for you. Yeah, that's the only way your your master is going to waste without an H 1d the first masters, and you need the three years of
course once you come back. Now, you have four semesters, so even if you graduate, yeah, you can get opt if you lose your job right now, like, whatever.

master. That doesn't count. Okay,
master. That doesn't count. Okay,
master. That doesn't count. Okay,
S Speaker 217:24okay, so that's my that's my doubt. Omkar, if, if I can get this change of status done in for the h4 h4 thing. I mean, if they can, they are like, Okay, your change of status was done in America. It's just the stamping thing. Why is not applicable for h1 as well. I mean, f1 as well. Because f1
okay, so that's my that's my doubt. Omkar, if, if I can get this change of status done in for the h4 h4 thing. I mean, if they can, they are like, Okay, your change of status was done in America. It's just the stamping thing. Why is not applicable for h1 as well. I mean, f1 as well. Because f1

S Speaker 117:50hard work. So is the difference? H4 you're just coming to America and spending time, actually, yeah. F1 you're showing intention of working in America, so you're potentially immigrant. Okay, that's the difference. Another thing is, we can crack your you go to UC Berkeley, right now. We can crack it. UC Berkeley has a good reputation, true. So you're, what is the what is? What do you have to prove? For f1 Yeah, for f1 sir, you have to prove you are a genuine student. True. Which we are not. Let's be honest, to continue working. Yeah, true. We're not able to prove that. Unfortunately, okay.
hard work. So is the difference? H4 you're just coming to America and spending time, actually, yeah. F1 you're showing intention of working in America, so you're potentially immigrant.

S Speaker 319:22the way I think Omkar, what it could be is like, we probably delay our December plans, not travel this time. Maybe plan it for delayed by six months or so. And I can aggressively try to see if I can get my I 140 approved meanwhile, so that by the time we shift to h4 and we get it converted to h4 EAD, and then she can resume her job. Because the main priority for us to shift to f1 like you mentioned, was the work permit. She was here, settled on an f2 so that was already done, and like all the Vida stamping things, was done, so we did this entire song and dance just to sort of get her work permit and she was able to find a job. So that's also something that I don't want to break right away. So I was thinking maybe delete a travel plan sometime, for some time, try to get my I 140 approved, and then do the entire edge for route like you suggested.

S Speaker 120:52for H 4e, D, okay, there was an option, but there is no premium option available, okay, then that coupled it in January this year. So it's usually, right now, six to 12 months to get an h4 EAD. But if you, if you apply and it's pending for four months, connect with me at that time, I will connect you to my attorney.
