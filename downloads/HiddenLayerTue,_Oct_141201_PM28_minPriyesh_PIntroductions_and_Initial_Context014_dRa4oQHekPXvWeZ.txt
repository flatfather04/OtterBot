S Speaker 20:43It happened in June. We moved to, like, a little like temporary place, because we've been, like, had, like, a crazy summer with weddings and stuff we've been going to but we just, literally just signed a lease for like, a five bedroom house, or four bedroom house, one of them, like, last week.

S Speaker 21:08getting no not yet. We're working on it. Okay, this last time, though, when I moved, it was the first time I finally paid for movers. Every time before that, I'm like, I'm never doing this again. And then eventually I'm just like, too cheap. I'll use the you all, but this past

S Speaker 16:45he's talking every problem that we have, but I've seen you guys also evolve. Christopher, so I don't want to just keep talking, but I would love to understand, my understanding is more about model security, model scanning, and, you know, being doing it in a very non invasive way, but would love to understand how you guys so I will stop here. I've been talking a lot any questions that I can answer before I let Priyesh do a quick intro, hopefully, yeah and

S Speaker 27:33you. Just one quick question. Did you say the check size is one to 12? Or is that the ARR size that you guys
you. Just one quick question. Did you say the check size is one to 12? Or is that the ARR size that you guys

you. Just one quick question. Did you say the check size is one to 12? Or is that the ARR size that you guys
S Speaker 17:39usually look at? Then you say, you say ARR size, it's like, do we need something? Yeah, it's gonna do, you know, put that in perspective. It's not like, you know, rule based play, because today it's like, you know, you can go from five to 10 or 15 if you have emotion figured out, right? There's no typical hurdle. But I will call out at Series B if you have less than 1 million or 2 million. Yeah. So I'm saying there's a, there's no, like, hard number that. I'll tell you that this is where you should be. If you're not there, we can't talk to you, right? There is a number where, which signals that, okay, there is some bit of repeatable motion,

S Speaker 18:39one to 12 was the range because so you know, let's say, if it's a seed series, a deal, right? We can invest, depending on the allocation, smaller check as well. Very cool.

S Speaker 18:54you. Yeah. I'll just keep my intro very quick. Chris Connor, pleasure meeting you both. I'm a Senior Associate here with the team. I'm working with Deepak on our AI infra mlops thesis. I've been with the team for about two years, but spent another year and a half with Menlo Ventures and Morpheus ventures. Very
you. Yeah. I'll just keep my intro very quick. Chris Connor, pleasure meeting you both. I'm a Senior Associate here with the team. I'm working with Deepak on our AI infra mlops thesis.

S Speaker 39:11cool. We know that we know Menlo Well, I don't know Marcus as much, but very, very cool. Great, great, great to meet you both really, really appreciate it. In fact, I mean, you know Deepak, you mentioned a lot of the things that we've sort of set out to build from the get go. I think a lot of our the field of our competitors, are starting to recognize this need as well. But right, right from the get go, three and a half years ago, we set out to build a full platform, which requires, for us, that meant supply chain, security, runtime, security red teaming, as well as security posture management. And we are full agnostic as far as form of AI as well. So we work on Gen AI agents, and we are securing production agents today, as well as traditional machine learning models. So predictive models are actually still the by far the majority of what's out there in artificial intelligence. And another big differentiator between us and some of the competition, many of them are sort of writing English language rules around prompts and responses, which can get to so far, that's relatively easy to do. Our technology is actually based originally on sort of traditional machine learning models, how embeddings light up the input layer, what good and bad traffic looks like there. And we built a bunch of detection mechanisms around that. And then we've kind of grown outward from that. But today, today we sell four products. We're moving into, ultimately close to six. That's really that it all sort of works together in one, one sort of platform response. And most, most of our customers are buying the full platform today. I believe we're the leader, both in terms of ARR on the on the customer and traction side, as well as in the the technical win category. We've done, you know, at this point, close to 50 bake offs, we've won them all. We are, we are right at the 5 million ARR mark, as far as where we're at now, which is 27 paying customers, average deal size, kind of in that three to 500k range. We do quite a bit with the federal government as well. We're in DOD intelligence community. We actually have sole source authority now within the federal government, within the categories of homeland security, intelligence and and Department of Defense, so they actually have to use us, or they have to go through a big escalation process that involves a competitive Bake Off and basically a big appeal not to use us. Now we we earn that by completing the CIPR program. So we did phases one, two and three of the sipper program, and then ultimately that led. So when I say we're at 5 million in ARR, we're actually about 12 million in TCV, but we don't, we don't count the federal stuff in ARR. Effectively, it could be, depending on how you like to measure it. A lot of startups do call it that, but we try and make sure that we cover all that. And then lastly, all that extends to five eyes nations as well. So we can use that in and then it comes with our own contract vehicle, up to 105 million over the next five years. We use that. We just use that. We just did that with the NSA. We're doing that with a few other spots as well. So about half of our revenue to date is coming from Homeland Security, intelligence and DOD, and then the rest is commercial, big financial institutions, big tech companies. We've done healthcare, insurance, retail. We're kind of loving that. Look like there was a question
cool. We know that we know Menlo Well, I don't know Marcus as much, but very, very cool. Great, great, great to meet you both really, really appreciate it.

S Speaker 112:02now, yeah, no, I the question I had was when you mentioned that the TCV is 12, you're not counting some part of it in the ARR, I just wanted to, because TCV is multi year, right? It could be like a two year contract or three year contract, and you might have beyond that, am I? Are you not counting anything in the 5 million, err, that you should be counting from an annual,
now, yeah, no, I the question I had was when you mentioned that the TCV is 12, you're not counting some part of it in the ARR, I just wanted to, because TCV is multi year, right?

S Speaker 213:18I can explain maybe to you, just, yeah, please. So part of the delta is due to a few things. Part of it is services, deals. And just to be clear, with services, we tend to just view those as effectively, like pay POCs. It's a way for us to get in there and demonstrate the need for our products. Show them. You might have a problem here. You should consider using us. Another part of it is, is these deals you can see here at the stars. These are part of the Siver and sitter program. So this was the government program that we went through in order to basically win the right to win the IDIQ contract, which we just won that provides us with the sole source authority. And all deals booked under the IDIQ contract are pure AR deals. However, these prior Siver and sitter deals do the way that the payments were structured from an accounting standpoint. You technically wouldn't call it AR, because it was a little lumpy than that. So we don't bucket those in Additionally, you have a deal here. This one, this is a multi year, three year 350 K or your deal, whatever multi year deal. Technically, the bookings are higher. And then finally, there's a handful little deals in here that are either like pay POCs or the lab licenses, whatever. I don't want to show a 60k you know, pay POC as Arr, because of that turns off fair representation I see. Moreover, I know there's plenty of companies that have called Pay POCs, Arr, and I'm not trying to get into that, uh, got it, got it bucket, so,

S Speaker 114:47so now it's clear. So this 11.6 is a total contract value. It might include a POC, it might include a three year commitment. It might include an annual contract with some services component. It's everything included, right?
so now it's clear. So this 11.6 is a total contract value. It might include a POC, it might include a three year commitment. It might include an annual contract with some services component. It's everything included, right?

S Speaker 215:01And it also includes just, you're aware this one here is 211 million, and then this 340k those were early renewals from two of our AR customers, if you actually look up here. So it's also includes some early renewals as well bookings, but it's not error jpmg

S Speaker 315:22Yeah, that over 100% they've been good, good happy customers for us. But and I'll walk you through the rest of the two. I just want to give you guys an idea for what we've
Yeah, that over 100% they've been good, good happy customers for us. But and I'll walk you through the rest of the two. I just want to give you guys an idea for what we've

S Speaker 115:37clarification question there, because 12 versus five was there was, maybe, can we talk about the product a little bit like how works? And if you can tie that Christopher with, how do you get into an enterprise, right? So, which, because it seems like there are multiple ways that you can get in of all these products. Some, some might need red teaming, some might need model security. That's
clarification question there, because 12 versus five was there was, maybe, can we talk about the product a little bit like how works? And if you can tie that Christopher with, how do you get into an enterprise, right? So, which, because it seems like there are multiple ways that you can get in of all these products.

Some, some might need red teaming, some might need model security. That's
S Speaker 316:00correct, yeah. So we usually, we have four, four products today that are GA Yeah. The first two are kind of our main revenue drivers. They're over 90% of our revenue. Which is number one is our supply chain solution that we call model scanner. This is what actually scans the models themselves and the code that comes with them. We are looking for this at the signs, like indications of poisoning with the models, malware hidden in the models we're looking for, models hidden in the models we're starting to see now as well. So, you know, there's examples of like, you know, the first Netflix account on hugging face was not Netflix. It was threat actors. They were distributing malware through models and just this type of thing. So oftentimes, our customers are just building us right into their CICD, wherever they're scanning other software, bringing it into the company. They're just, they're extending it to models, and this is pre deployment, right? So you scan post deployment as well. Most of our customers scan in perpetuity. So we can integrate directly into your model repository, like data crix, bedrock, whatever you're using. So you know, if you have a live model, you know that then they're worried about insider threats, or that being part two of a traditional attack where somebody gets in and makes alterations. So we scan models that are post production as well, but yeah, part of a part of a pre, pre production price or pre deployment pipeline as well. That's about like 40% of our revenue. And then, and we have a lot of customers come to us right out of the gate for that, not necessarily because it's more important, but because they were more ready for it. A lot of customers who were, you know, they were building model repositories. They were ready to kind of scan those things right away. Then about 45% of our revenue comes from runtime, what we call AI detection and response. This is a lot of our competitors call an AI firewall. It's effectively
correct, yeah. So we usually, we have four, four products today that are GA Yeah. The first two are kind of our main revenue drivers. They're over 90% of our revenue.

can we unpack that a little bit Absolutely? Yeah, yeah.
can we unpack that a little bit Absolutely? Yeah, yeah.
S Speaker 317:42So as I mentioned a lot, a lot of companies are doing one of two things. They are taking the open source sets of malicious prompts, and they're training a classifier, and then they're calling that their AI firewall. That is woefully insufficient to building an AI detection and response product or a runtime product. Those are extremely noisy. They are they false positive like crazy. They don't catch most attacks anyway. They don't catch multi stage attacks or multi prompt attacks. There's quite a bit there that that's kind of missing, and this is why we like so much for our customers, just to try everything out like our favorite thing is like, hey, let's do a bake off. You should take tell everyone to give you your product. Do a do a paid POC, to do a free POC, whatever, because you're going to see the difference in our solution and their solution at the efficacy level there, we do quite a bit. We're multimodal. We don't just scan text. We're scanning documents, images, video. We forget that voice. We catch a lot of threats code embedded in a image file, that's correct? Yeah, we do. We do stegan steganographic attacks that way. We do both from different kinds of image files. We also have a bunch of modality control in our solution, so you can actually do it at a role based level. So examples of how our customers use that or, like, you probably want your engineers writing code with LMS. You probably don't want your HR team writing code with LMS. Like, we can. We can control all of that for you. We can you know which ones you want to be able to reach outbound through like websites, which ones you want to be able to have things like, you know, maybe you don't want anybody making a video. We can, we can lock all that, that kind of stuff down. And then we do quite a bit more as far as, like data loss. So you can take any of your DLP solutions and pipe it right into ours so it extends the capabilities immediately. You can also use ours to create custom entities too, if you'd like. So we have all the normal entities, social security numbers, phone numbers, all that kind of stuff. But you can turn that off and up. We have a very robust policy engine in terms of how you want to actually control what you want to allow what you don't. So anyway, these two solutions are, are the majority of why customers come to us. The other two, we kind of include for free. So we that is our automated red teaming solution, so that it's an agent in itself. We built an automated agent to Red Team our solutions. We can do a lot with that. So we can build attack packages alongside OWASP, miter, NIST, whatever you'd like. We're also starting to build some for ISO 42,001 the changes that are coming to Sox Oxley, the changes that are coming to HIPAA, we actually have some of those packages that you can test in there as well. We can test benign traffic as well. We can, we can push benign traffic through anything there. A lot of our guys lose that. Use that for just like, you know, load testing and some of those pieces we have the ability to do, define system prompt testing. So we can do we have something that we call the system prompt hardener, so we can actually take your system prompt, suggest much better system prompts to you as far as like changes you should be able to make. There. We have a whole bunch of reporting to come out of that as well. We also in the pre deployment we use that with in the pre deployment workflows, people will basically run red teaming, then deploy a IDR, then run red team again. So they will do red teaming both, both pre or and after, yeah, we have a big part of that. And then, so that's a pretty strong product. And then lastly, we have what we call model inventory. And this is the security posture management solution. This is a discoverability so we'll discover all of your models. We'll scan your cloud environment. We'll scan your repositories, whatever you'd like. We'll identify what all your models are. Then we'll actually take our model scanner and we will scan the models to tell you not just where they are, but what they are. So we can scan it. We have a solution we call genealogy that's inside our model scanner. So we can actually scan a model that we know nothing about and say, Hey, this is a fine tuned version of llama. Here's all the other places on the internet you can find it intelligence built into the solution as well.
So as I mentioned a lot, a lot of companies are doing one of two things.

They don't catch most attacks anyway. They don't catch multi stage attacks or multi prompt attacks. There's quite a bit there that that's kind of missing, and this is why we like so much for our customers, just to try everything out like our favorite thing is like, hey, let's do a bake off. You should take tell everyone to give you your product. Do a do a paid POC, to do a free POC, whatever, because you're going to see the difference in our solution and their solution at the efficacy level there, we do quite a bit. We're multimodal. We don't just scan text. We're scanning documents, images, video. We forget that voice. We catch a lot of threats code embedded in a image file, that's correct? Yeah, we do. We do stegan steganographic attacks that way. We do both from different kinds of image files. We also have a bunch of modality control in our solution, so you can actually do it at a role based level. So examples of how our customers use that or, like, you probably want your engineers writing code with LMS. You probably don't want your HR team writing code with LMS. Like, we can. We can control all of that for you. We can you know which ones you want to be able to reach outbound through like websites, which ones you want to be able to have things like, you know, maybe you don't want anybody making a video. We can, we can lock all that, that kind of stuff down. And then we do quite a bit more as far as, like data loss. So you can take any of your DLP solutions and pipe it right into ours so it extends the capabilities immediately. You can also use ours to create custom entities too, if you'd like. So we have all the normal entities, social security numbers, phone numbers, all that kind of stuff. But you can turn that off and up. We have a very robust policy engine in terms of how you want to actually control what you want to allow what you don't. So anyway, these two solutions are, are the majority of why customers come to us. The other two, we kind of include for free. So we that is our automated red teaming solution, so that it's an agent in itself. We built an automated agent to Red Team our solutions. We can do a lot with that. So we can build attack packages alongside OWASP, miter, NIST, whatever you'd like. We're also starting to build some for ISO 42,001 the changes that are coming to Sox Oxley, the changes that are coming to HIPAA, we actually have some of those packages that you can test in there as well. We can test benign traffic as well. We can, we can push benign traffic through anything there. A lot of our guys lose that. Use that for just like, you know, load testing and some of those pieces we have the ability to do, define system prompt testing. So we can do we have something that we call the system prompt hardener, so we can actually take your system prompt, suggest much better system prompts to you as far as like changes you should be able to make. There. We have a whole bunch of reporting to come out of that as well. We also in the pre deployment we use that with in the pre deployment workflows, people will basically run red teaming, then deploy a IDR, then run red team again. So they will do red teaming both, both pre or and after, yeah, we have a big part of that. And then, so that's a pretty strong product. And then lastly, we have what we call model inventory. And this is the security posture management solution. This is a discoverability so we'll discover all of your models. We'll scan your cloud environment. We'll scan your repositories, whatever you'd like. We'll identify what all your models are. Then we'll actually take our model scanner and we will scan the models to tell you not just where they are, but what they are. So we can scan it. We have a solution we call genealogy that's inside our model scanner. So we can actually scan a model that we know nothing about and say, Hey, this is a fine tuned version of llama. Here's all the other places on the internet you can find it intelligence built into the solution as well.
S Speaker 121:23So how would you discover it? So let's say, within an enterprise, there are 20 building different projects. Yeah, right, models. So do you have to officially integrate through API's on one one by one?
So how would you discover it? So let's say, within an enterprise, there are 20 building different projects. Yeah, right, models. So do you have to officially integrate through API's on one one by one?

Now, all of our customers have all of that. So you know, nobody's really just a one stop shop as far as who they're using, but we've built more integrations than anybody else as far as that goes, like most of our customers, they just give us an account access there, and then we can go in and pull out all their

S Speaker 122:08models for them, interesting, interesting components here, right? So I think you talked about the initial first product, which is 40% and then the AI firewall, which is 45% of the revenues, what is resonating with the customers, right?

S Speaker 324:21We do. So we have, we look for research, for outbound connections to open AI and anthropic and here, and all the other places as well. So we can get both the models with our model scanner as well as the connections outbound. These are two APIs, effectively, API, that's correct. Yeah, that's correct. Yeah. So, so via the API, and most of our products are leveraging, most of our customers are leveraging our API's. And so whether it's side by side with one of the models they've been building, whether it's open source, but we work effectively on anything. We don't need to build new versions of our products for different model types, because we're, again, at the inference level, looking at kind of the embeddings. And so we're not, we don't necessarily, that's one of the reasons we're pretty agnostic across the board. But yeah, that's, that's, that's ultimately, how they're how they're leveraging it. You know, all of our customers are recognizing they need all of it, even if they came to us for one of these pieces. So, you know, they might say, hey, I want to scan my models. But then they're starting to realize, you know, especially now that we're starting to see more AI platform teams and more AI security teams, different organizations, but, but they're all sounding like the exact same that, yeah,

S Speaker 325:26Yeah, absolutely. So we are. We're raising somewhere between 1500 million. We're debating and kind of how to how to raise that. At the moment, we we do have a large financial institution that's going to be participating some existing groups. We do have a little bit more room for groups like yourselves, but we're basically trying to get the best lead we can get right now, as far as as far as that goes and that that's kind of our main focus. But, you know, we already have a term sheet from the financial institution where we have some other groups that we're kind of working through right now. We're going to try and figure it out before the holidays, but it may move into early next year. We're kind of year. We're kind of not sure what that looks like. But the other side is we're, we'll likely finish our fiscal year, which is the end of January, close to, if not above, double digit. Arr, so we may wait until we get those figures in before we go to go to the so we're, that is
