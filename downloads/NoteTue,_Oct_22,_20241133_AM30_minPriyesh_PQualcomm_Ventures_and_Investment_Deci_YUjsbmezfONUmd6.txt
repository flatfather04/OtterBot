S Speaker 10:47but Eric Erickson was a made a strategic investment in us back in our Series A round or one of our Series C transit has been around for a while. It so they have a board observer seat, but I will say that partnership is not really born much group for us. So it was interesting kind of context of Qualcomm, like Erickson said, hey, you know, we're selling a lot of things to Telecom, simply really relevant, and we have a bunch of telecom customers. So it seemed like a good kind of marriage. But as we worked with various product teams and then call within Ericsson, we've yet to really come up with a really compelling better than Better Together story, mainly because, although our stuff will theoretically run in a private data center, there's things like we rely on Kubernetes and object storage. So if you've got Kubernetes, obviously the optimal running Kubernetes in the data center. There are lots of things that can make s3 like API. So there's people using Nio or using wasabi, and there's lots of things that fundamentally sort of rely on there being some sort of big object storage. And we found that while theoret When you can run us, and then we tested it, we validated you can run us in data center, the value proposition, the economics are mostly in a big public cloud like Amazon, Google, Azure, Oracle window. That's that's really where we see most of our customers and our business. And so we just it's the story doesn't resonate as well when people are still running

S Speaker 22:21and on prem, and it's an interesting conversation, which is just having somebody as well, which is, you know, we the war goes through.

S Speaker 22:49because they will always go through this flux of moving data center data, data from across data centers to data centers To on prem, to on prem, from on prem to, you know, it all depends where your CEO, CFO, at the time, and then it all depends on how your company is being run at the time. And then these decisions will always be flexible. Hence, data migration companies are always

S Speaker 13:20so we we have, like, those are big customer of our Comcast, big customer to go through my notes to see, like, I know, I know, telecom is definitely an area for us. It not. It's like our biggest customer there, media, gaming, security, most kind

S Speaker 13:42So telecom is, you know, an area where we've had some, some, some good Lighthouse customers. But it's not, you know, nowhere near the kind of success we've had in media gaming customers today are we about half our business in the US and half overseas in the US. We've got Disney, Hulu, ESPN, NBC, CBS, like most of the big streaming platforms today are interesting. Apple is even a customer, but they're really very small. They're one of our smaller customers. What's the deal? We hope to expand on Netflix. We don't we're not talking to it all, but they're probably the only major streaming platform we are already deeply indented with in some ways. So that's the reason is twofold. One is sort of the problem we solved for so, just so there's a few art here. Map like our senses logging, observability is people generally talk about metrics and traces and logs, but within that there's different types of logs. And so there are, like, application logs, that developer info, warning catalogs, that's the data like that, like metrics and traces, is really interesting for about three days, because you want to see what happened. You know that outage you have over the weekend, but after that, no one's trying to keep their traces around for 15 months, that no one's looking at year over year. And so, like, your application logs are really only interested for very short period, whereas you're trying where is your transaction logs? So think web server logs your CDN logs your firewall logs your your your sim data, your XDR data, your you know the data that you've got regulatory requirements to keep around, like your call metadata, that information, actually it's a full represents a user, transaction or a session, is interesting to keep around year over year. People want to build do deep learning on this data. They want to look at your rear patterns. They want to compare what's happening right now to what's going on a month ago or a year ago that those trends. So people tend to logs as very big umbrella, but we're very focused only on the very high cardinality, very high dimensional transaction log data that is valuable to retain long term. And the second dimension is our sense was, even with transaction logs, a lot of companies only generating millions of transactions a day. And at that scale, you know, the outsource the data dog to Sumo, logic to New Relic, Splunk, like you spend 1000 bucks you get rid of the problem. It's when you get to the scale of billions of transactions, there terabytes of data that you're just not the pricing on those things, it becomes irrational. And so that was before the whole the market was transaction logs that are valuable over time, but at that kind of terabyte scale, there wasn't a good solution. And so most companies had definitely given up on SaaS. Instead, we see biologic move to like Elks tech. They've got a big Elastic Search cluster, open source Elastic Search running on Amazon or Google or Azure, and spending millions of dollars a month for three days of retention of hot data and then something else for all their cold data. So like after it was three days old, it was snowflake, big, gray, rich, being a druid, Preston, whatever. But some cobbled together, some kind of hot, warm, cold triage. But we it was like, We love elastic because we get real time, you know, interactive dashboard. We can run Kibana. We can see what's happening in real time. And then once the data ages out, then, well, it's there. Like, we really want to search it. We can, but, you know, then you're talking like you run a Hadoop job, right? I mean, that somebody, the data is there, but it's cold and it isn't really we have to rehydrate it. That was the problem set. We said, We go after that. Can we make all data hot? We go after those, you know, 220, 200 terabytes a day, kind of companies, yes. And say, we can make all your data hot going back two years. So you can run that kind of same interactive dashboard, same with interactive search, sub second query performance against your data, no matter how old it is, can reduce your overall cost. They make it as cost effective to save your data for 15 months is what you're getting, what your savings may have lasted for three days retention, and give you 15 months retention. And so there's a huge kind of price and performance and costs are all sort of the same point. Like, I can give you the same performance as elastic at a fraction of the cost, or give you better retention for the same cost. Like, solve for one of these kind of problems. And we came and we the message didn't resonate for the first couple years because people kept saying, Yeah, we know we're burning a lot of money. We don't really care to like, Oh my God. We have to figure out a way to get a handle over data costs. And at the same time that science is coming and saying we've got to get a handle on these data costs, it's killing us. You were having product engineering and data science saying we want all the data we can. Have to stop throwing this data away. We have to stop rolling things up and aggregating it like, oh, we need all the raw data forever, because the better, the more data we have, the better the models we can build, like all these new business use cases that demand more data, and the it in the middle, trying to solve for financing through data away and IT and engineering saying, keep up. You can't solve so we had, in the last two months, our business went from two customers and 70,000 a month in revenue to 300 customers and 1.7 million a month in revenue, just by being able to say, hey, I can, I can solve for that problem. I can change the economics in a way that just makes it easy to solve for both parties. Financially happy, your costs are down and your costs are flat. Engineering is happy, because now we've got everything like we've sort of made you the hero, and we've had this tremendous adoption. So that's my
So telecom is, you know, an area where we've had some, some, some good Lighthouse customers.

And so most companies had definitely given up on SaaS. Instead, we see biologic move to like Elks tech. They've got a big Elastic Search cluster, open source Elastic Search running on Amazon or Google or Azure, and spending millions of dollars a month for three days of retention of hot data and then something else for all their cold data. So like after it was three days old, it was snowflake, big, gray, rich, being a druid, Preston, whatever. But some cobbled together, some kind of hot, warm, cold triage. But we it was like, We love elastic because we get real time, you know, interactive dashboard. We can run Kibana. We can see what's happening in real time. And then once the data ages out, then, well, it's there. Like, we really want to search it. We can, but, you know, then you're talking like you run a Hadoop job, right? I mean, that somebody, the data is there, but it's cold and it isn't really we have to rehydrate it. That was the problem set. We said, We go after that. Can we make all data hot? We go after those, you know, 220, 200 terabytes a day, kind of companies, yes. And say, we can make all your data hot going back two years. So you can run that kind of same interactive dashboard, same with interactive search, sub second query performance against your data, no matter how old it is, can reduce your overall cost. They make it as cost effective to save your data for 15 months is what you're getting, what your savings may have lasted for three days retention, and give you 15 months retention. And so there's a huge kind of price and performance and costs are all sort of the same point. Like, I can give you the same performance as elastic at a fraction of the cost, or give you better retention for the same cost. Like, solve for one of these kind of problems. And we came and we the message didn't resonate for the first couple years because people kept saying, Yeah, we know we're burning a lot of money. We don't really care to like, Oh my God. We have to figure out a way to get a handle over data costs. And at the same time that science is coming and saying we've got to get a handle on these data costs, it's killing us. You were having product engineering and data science saying we want all the data we can. Have to stop throwing this data away. We have to stop rolling things up and aggregating it like, oh, we need all the raw data forever, because the better, the more data we have, the better the models we can build, like all these new business use cases that demand more data, and the it in the middle, trying to solve for financing through data away and IT and engineering saying, keep up. You can't solve so we had, in the last two months, our business went from two customers and 70,000 a month in revenue to 300 customers and 1.7 million a month in revenue, just by being able to say, hey, I can, I can solve for that problem. I can change the economics in a way that just makes it easy to solve for both parties. Financially happy, your costs are down and your costs are flat. Engineering is happy, because now we've got everything like we've sort of made you the hero, and we've had this tremendous adoption. So that's my

We were mostly selling against open source, against elastic, but not really the company, like most of our customers, using open search, open source, like so, not paying it elastic. I think just the cost of running open source, Elastic Search on, you know, standard Amazon hardware is extraordinarily expensive.

and and so, the key value prop for
S Speaker 19:40early customers. It was the first 20 deals. It was, I'm going to reduce your cost by 75% you can't afford to not evaluate my product. Basically cost saving for the last day one or week day one. Yeah, the last nine months, it's been more, you know what? For what you're spending today. Give you a lot more money for value for your money. Like, if you can get rid of your cold start, you don't need to also run Presto and druid whatever. Like, you can run like, we're gonna keep your data highly compressed in this three and you can run all these jobs. If you can run Dataverse on hydraulics. You can run Splunk dashboards on hydraulics data. You can run your Kibana and refine it super so whatever you want to do, you can run it on the drugs data. You don't need to also keep another copy, because we can serve as all those different departments and needs and things. So there's been a lot of just like, it's just giving your whole instead of leaving money on the table, just giving your whole wallet, because you've got a lot more value for your body. And then, more recently, in the last, say, three months, we've started to see more green field opportunities where there is no budget today because they price. We just, actually just got the fox contract five minutes ago, we decided with box they generate a lot of data. They're handling no NFL games. They had price. Now decided they weren't going to collect any logs, because it was going to cost. They estimated cost $2 million a month, and no one's going to write a business case for why we need to spend $25 million a year on logging. And so they just give it up, and they just collect metrics. We just give them, like, high level disability before, so you just, they just, they didn't, they just read it. They didn't keep it in. They just use metric, you know, they get metrics from their CDN providers. So they can see, like, the total number of hits, the total number like they can see, oh, that's aggregate numbers. But there's no wrong, there's no log. So you can actually see, you know, subscribers ATT, subscribers in North Carolina having tougher issues that's just lost in the noise. You don't have that kind of level of granularity, but metrics your security team can't do like, Hey, have we seen this IP address the last six months? You can't do fraud detection, you can't do block detection, you can't do beat us. Like, none of the things are possible if all you have is, like, hourly metrics. So but they just it was $25 million a big was a big ass we can. And said, Look, we can do this for probably $2 million a year, total cost of ownership, like infrastructure, the hardware, the software, the license, the whole thing going to come to like, oh, for 2 million years, I can build the business. So they went and got budget to go build a logging platform using hydraulics. Because once you get the unit cost down into a realm of something that's rational, it's easy to go in this case, like, the value of the data is huge. It just, but it's definitely worth a million dollars. So that's what the most exciting for me is, like, you know, starting out, like, I don't want to just cannibalize the existing market. I want to grow the market, I believe there's elastic demand here, like, if you get the unit cost down, there's all kinds of other workloads and use cases that people have been scared of before that are all of sudden, like, you bring into the realm of possibility data that was stuck into cold storage that wasn't really searchable, also, like all my data searchable. So what does that open up for you in terms of opportunity? What new business things can you do now that all your data certificate to expose the data to customers, internal teams, like, that's really our mission is like, not just to save people money, but really to transform the value of the data, how it powers the business.

S Speaker 115:43bucks is what we do fall into right now. I mean, we can keep it essentially forever. It just at some point. The difference is, like, with a lot of platforms with elastic in particular, storages or drives, cost, the cost of building lasting cluster to store one day of data versus a week of data, it's seven times more expensive people when they can score seven days of data, and to build one can store 30 days. It is 30 like, it's the retention. The total data footprint is what drives the compute cost and the storage cost in our platform, because we're using, because we've got really good compression, because we're using s3 like, again, the quick, the quick like, you know, sales pitches, you take a terabyte of raw data, you stick an elastic search. By the time you add the indices on top, it kind of bloats the data. Now you've got one and a quarter terabytes. Now you need replication. Now you've got two and a half terabytes. Now you're paying for EBS storage, which is 10 cents a gig. So now you're talking about $250 a month per terabyte. I can take a terabyte of raw data, index, every dimension, compress it down right as three and 55 gigabytes of storage. That's going to cost you $1.15 a month. Reduce me $1.15 a month and $250 a month is in between keeping your data for three days versus keeping it.

Who do you typically like? What do you typically replace like? Mostly.
Who do you typically like? What do you typically replace like? Mostly.
S Speaker 116:59But so what happens is, typically the value prop and the sales really get, like, just throw Elastic Search we can make like, that's where you're spending all your money, but in the same time, often they'll have something else for cold storage. Like, we're using elastic for three days, but we're also keeping another copy of our data in and that's where it becomes this explosion of Athena, BigQuery, redshift, snow, like drew a presto, like there's a million things out there for storing your cold data, and so you can search it, but you know, those searches can take minutes to run. You're not going to run dashboards on top of presto. You can run jobs on it, but so that's where we often say, but here's long but you don't need those hydraulics. Ends up consuming both your hot and your cold databases. And so we ended up but the value prop, the real, the big dollars on that at the last time. Search cluster that used to keep 30 days, and now is down to four days, and now you're sampling 10% because that's the big dollars. We replaced snowflake. It was an accident. Obviously, we're replacing snowflake for everything. Like we're not an asset data warehouse. We're not built for a bunch of use cases, but for this particular transaction log, for this append only, immutable kind of data that's high volume, high cardinality of data, nothing else is really purpose built for that. So we end up use BigQuery for this. Game is changing. If you're building user profiles and constantly updating your user profiles, don't use us. We're not passive complaint. We don't support updates if you have but your firewall logs, you have to go back and modify those. Like those come in and those were set in stone. And so a write once, read many times, kind of approach is, really is a good fit for your XDR data, your sim data. These kind of your Add to add tags, a great ad tag zone where you've got, they've got a bunch of user profiles that they're constantly building and updating, don't use us, then you've got all your bid data, which is like, we either won or lost this bid. There's lots of billions and billions of records a day that you want to be able to store. We're perfect for that, for that data,
But so what happens is, typically the value prop and the sales really get, like, just throw Elastic Search we can make like, that's where you're spending all your money, but in the same time, often they'll have something else for cold storage. Like, we're using elastic for three days, but we're also keeping another copy of our data in and that's where it becomes this explosion of Athena, BigQuery, redshift, snow, like drew a presto, like there's a million things out there for storing your cold data, and so you can search it, but you know, those searches can take minutes to run. You're not going to run dashboards on top of presto. You can run jobs on it, but so that's where we often say, but here's long but you don't need those hydraulics. Ends up consuming both your hot and your cold databases. And so we ended up but the value prop, the real, the big dollars on that at the last time. Search cluster that used to keep 30 days, and now is down to four days, and now you're sampling 10% because that's the big dollars. We replaced snowflake. It was an accident. Obviously, we're replacing snowflake for everything. Like we're not an asset data warehouse. We're not built for a bunch of use cases, but for this particular transaction log, for this append only, immutable kind of data that's high volume, high cardinality of data, nothing else is really purpose built for that. So we end up use BigQuery for this. Game is changing. If you're building user profiles and constantly updating your user profiles, don't use us. We're not passive complaint. We don't support updates if you have but your firewall logs, you have to go back and modify those. Like those come in and those were set in stone. And so a write once, read many times, kind of approach is, really is a good fit for your XDR data, your sim data.

We had to go back and kind of, you know, read a bunch of things. One of the best things ever happened, I that happen, let us come in and do a PRC with them. And it just it was a complete disaster. But we learned to train this man about doing this, really at scale with live data. And so it took us another year to come out with so we closed our first real customer in this in 21 and then we closed another big whale in 22 and things are pretty slow.

S Speaker 224:47basically your solution to our product is our cloud inference product. We had a we have an AI cloud inference product. And that's where, I think, is where we have a product relationship. We can build a product relationship and go sell the relationship and go sell the customers together. So that's the part which, that's what I had in mind. And so that's so let me pursue both, yeah,
basically your solution to our product is our cloud inference product. We had a we have an AI cloud inference product. And that's where, I think, is where we have a product relationship.

S Speaker 126:01we've been curious to talk about, I mean, we don't, we don't have, really the strong AI story today, other than sort of waving our hands and saying, because people have more data, they need more places. We need infrastructure to store that data. I think more like, do you have security products today that you're selling?
we've been curious to talk about, I mean, we don't, we don't have, really the strong AI story today, other than sort of waving our hands and saying, because people have more data, they need more places.

S Speaker 226:17Do you have not in the data center? We sell security products and manage devices, so we don't have a security product that we sell up to the data center now. Oh, yeah. So, Oh, that's interesting, yeah. So, like,
Do you have not in the data center? We sell security products and manage devices, so we don't have a security product that we sell up to the data center now. Oh, yeah. So, Oh, that's interesting, yeah. So, like,
Do you have not in the data center? We sell security products and manage devices, so we don't have a security product that we sell up to the data center now. Oh, yeah. So, Oh, that's interesting, yeah. So, like,

what I mean, what products you have today that are generated that didn't generate
S Speaker 226:35huge amounts of data, all of our products generate a lot of data that it's all that data gets stored in the data centers. Like, like all of our products, we sell a billion chips that go into these every year. No,

so, so all of these are generating lots and lots of data, more data than anything else. So,
so, so all of these are generating lots and lots of data, more data than anything else. So,
so, so all of these are generating lots and lots of data, more data than anything else. So,
S Speaker 127:03can we, can we build? We build dashboards are easier to sell than a database. Can I we build? Are there products that we can this? Will build dashboards for this

S Speaker 227:12part, we have a data, you know? I know exactly. Okay, okay, good. So we have pure data. Which is our own. So what we are trying to do is we are trying to collect a lot of the data from all these devices that are in the market, and then we actually provide that as a value. We're providing as a value prop, I believe, to the carriers and the OEMs
part, we have a data, you know? I know exactly. Okay, okay, good. So we have pure data. Which is our own.

S Speaker 227:57a customer? It's more like, oh, like our customers would want access to that data, and they would want nice dashboards to access to that data, that they would want to keep that data for a long, long time. So that would be a pain point for all of our customers. We are saying that we're going to provide a pipeline to be able to collect
a customer? It's more like, oh, like our customers would want access to that data, and they would want nice dashboards to access to that data, that they would want to keep that data for a long, long time.

S Speaker 128:18this so we we can provide a service like an endpoint for that data to say, pretty much that's where we had success. Today, we attached to other products. So Akamai is selling their 50 security products, and we built dashboards for each of those products. You're buying Akamai, DDoS, communication. Do you want to actually buy Akamai DNS? Do you want dashboards you're buying Akamai, whatever

S Speaker 128:40buying Amazon elemental, you're buying CloudFront, you're buying their their shield product. Do you want dashboards? So attaching, building dashboards that attach to our existing product that customers are buying and say that probably is great, but you don't have the observability, you don't have the visibility you need. We'll provide you with visibility. All you gotta do is, you know, point your data here and and we'll Can you just get the visibility that's where we've seen we go from third, from 30% conversion rates to 70% conversion rates. When we're selling a solution that attaches to existing product, rather than like a general purpose platform that you can do anything with. It's very hard to sell with database. It's much people are much more compelled. There's much more, even more money on the newly like, Oh, I've got a solution. You're buying x, if you want for eyes with that, we can that's a transaction. We can close very quickly. We went from 99 month sales cycles to 45 day sales cycles. Yeah, and from 30% conversion to 70% conversion. Now, some of those are tied together. When deals drag on longer, they're less likely to close. When they're fast, they just, they're much easier to complete. I'm

29:45going to use that.
S Speaker 129:48I'm happy to make the picture. I'd say we've been very open to taking strategic investments from like, you know, from Ericsson, from Akamai, for these folks who are partner with us, generally, the goal is, and I think we made a mistake with Ericsson, because the time we were just, we need money. But the general girls like, figure out, figure out the Fit First, figure out, you know, get something going, get some, some pain going,
