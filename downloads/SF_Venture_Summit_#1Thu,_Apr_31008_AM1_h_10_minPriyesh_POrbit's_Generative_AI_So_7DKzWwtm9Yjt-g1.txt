S Speaker 16:19alright. So we have over 100 customers. You can see here how many bucks they fix? We are very fast. Here we have public companies, large companies, with literally hundreds of developers using it, huge profile companies using it. They land with a team, and then they spend 200 seats. We're doing over 200k AR, this number is already outdated. We have less than 3% AR charity bus growing very fast. We are raising a seat. Round of 5 million have already 3.5 million per minute, but there is space for another investor to commit. Thank you,

S Speaker 211:28So the US immigration market is a $9 billion industry. What's there are over 10 million immigration filings each year. And what's more interesting in this industry is that over 90% of immigration firms work on a flat fee basis, and we are the perfect team to be building this. I'm Khalil. My background is in artificial intelligence and data science before gaze blink. I was a natural language processing data scientist at Google, John our CTO spent over 15 years building infrastructure that scales and he's a three times founder. And Tina, who's sitting right there is right here is a business integration attorney who spent over 10 years working exactly on these pieces. And the team keeps expanding with expertise and legal AI, engineering and product. Our vision is to connect law firms global liquidity teams and individuals. The most powerful case preparation. I'm Khalil. This is gaze blink, the most advanced AI companion for integration. Thank you.

S Speaker 313:41I'm here with our CEO. Can you just wave? Come find us afterwards, to find a compressed in. We are revolutionizing the way manufacturing is done, and we are starting. We are starting with simply some of the most complex manufacturing environments on the planet, which is manufacturing plants, semiconductors underpin all of AI revolution and with the global geopolitical shifts, there is semiconductor plants are being built all. Over the world manufacturing facility. Things are being moved around. This is the wind in our sails. This is the why now for this kind of technology. So what's the problem? Statement? Right? This is some of the most advanced manufacturing environment in the world. The process you're going down to two nanometers. This is some of the most advanced technologies in the world. How dare I say it's under optimized or inefficient, but it is. The running of these factories is very inefficient. It's huge capitals. These factories powers from 10 to $20 billion that number is already outdated. Today we see mega fabs, which are going up to $50 billion in capex to build these. These are the things that are powering every revolution that underpins what you're seeing from self driving cars to data centers, and AI right? It's hundreds of scaled operators that require 1000s of interconnected machines, millions of step combinations that are happening as these productions of. The very scary fact is that most of this is manually done today. The operations at the fact and here are the numbers, less than 80% efficiency, three to six months manufacturing cycles. Typical waste is more than 5% some of these numbers go down to as little as 60, what 60, 50% and 5% waste, hundreds of millions of dollars being left on the table because these factories, which cost so much, are just not being. Operating efficiently.

So what's our solution? Very simply put,
S Speaker 316:07we have a software solution which builds, trains, deploys and monitors AI agents on the factory floor to control and schedule the movement of materials. In the Factory in South Africa. We are moving wafers around. We are scheduling jobs. We are predicting when missions could go down, when should, when should new jobs be done, etc. And we are training these AI agents in simulation and with historical data, which is which exposes the agents to all kinds of circumstances. Weird corner cases that could happen inside the factory, and the agents learn, and the agents and the agents learn how to deal with these corner cases, how to respond dynamically to the changing state of the factory, and this is how we are able to increase productivity, reduce cycle time and improve lining. This is the holy grail of the KPIs of. On traditional operator interventions and its flexible API optimizations, so AI agents deployed inside the factory floor to optimize your operations. This is our roadmap, and also our product roadmap. We do prediction, we do factory prediction, predicting the state of the factories, and then we use these reinforcement learning agents to control the factories genuinely going forward, what we are raising funding for is to build funding factory planning and to move on to supply chain organization, to. That's a huge target market that we are going on. We starting with certain factors, but we moving on manufacturing,

S Speaker 636:02The brain behind this is my co father, Vlad. To work for meta for six years as an AI researcher and stem cell research today, and he's built two search engines too. The market is huge. We're starting with recruitment market, but there are also a lot of other markets in the future, like sales and regeneration and so on. But we're focused on today, and there are a lot of AI infrastructures being created today. Most of them build all in one solutions, and all of them hate sourcing, because sourcing is the hardest part of it. No one can build a good search engine, and we have the best sourcing Search Engine today on the market, and we're building our API for them, and we think that not. Buy an API for more than 10 years, and even if they did, they have the worst search on the market. We've just got our first paying customer with API. $500,000 produced revenue, and they made a prepayment. We're building API for them right now. So we're switching now from r&d stage to launching the product. We're going to read 3 million seed rounds for this. And if you're interested in talking about this, please message me. Here's my email, and you can also message me on umbrella. Thank you very much.

S Speaker 850:47Thank you. So we're also AI because the world's first retail AI foundation model, and essentially the money commercials have a solution that can run low power edge devices like a just a manual or a hill. And we've got an IP portfolio, both in patents developed from Carnegie Mellon University. My name is Mario savinas. I am the founder, CEO and CTO i. I've had previous Nexus where we've basically been acquired by your wallets company, and my previous customer promise and retail is 5550 what was being inventory in Walmart stores. And that's where we're good at what we do. The nap we've developed is mostly leveraged from technology that we built in the visual recognition area. Working in 2020, years with the DOD and different filament agencies worth of over $50 million of research. And we won many awards, including the outstanding point of view of AI from the Secretary of the Army it's around McCarthy. And many others. So those strong team called engineers AI ml, all from corneum Valley University, and that's where we're in today. Stuart Evans, my co founder, was supposed to present today, and something came up. So I apologize I'm remote, presenting

And we won many awards, including the outstanding point of view of AI from the Secretary of the Army it's around McCarthy. And many others. So those strong team called engineers AI ml, all from corneum Valley University, and that's where we're in today. Stuart Evans, my co founder, was supposed to present today, and something came up. So I apologize I'm remote, presenting
Thank you. So we're also AI because the world's first retail AI foundation model, and essentially the money commercials have a solution that can run low power edge devices like a just a manual or a hill. And we've got an IP portfolio, both in patents developed from Carnegie Mellon University. My name is Mario savinas. I am the founder, CEO and CTO i. I've had previous Nexus where we've basically been acquired by your wallets company, and my previous customer promise and retail is 5550 what was being inventory in Walmart stores.

52:09our first customer,
S Speaker 852:11and this is Jae Liu, the integration group, and after a year and a half of benchmarking their technology and everyone else out there, they chose us as the leading product ad manager. So what we do is we can identify products. For checkout, for using shrink or a variety of materials I'm going to and we can do self checkout. We can improve self checkout. One of the biggest problems with self checkout is there's a lot of shrink going on. I will show you some videos or some technology. We need to avoid that. Shelf monitoring analytics, car tracking, shopper tracking analytics, class CPG loss prevention, and even leverage some of our patients for getting back to somebody is, you know, the age, if you're selling later and whatnot. So this is a huge market, and if we just look at just the shrink problem. Of the retail National Retail Federation, as quoted as of September 17, 2024 it's $112 billion loss a year, and it's only increasing from 2019 23 it has increased 90% in terms of shocking dollar loss. So it's a huge problem, and it's overwhelmed by truly now, you know sales lost to that. Now what we have accomplished is that we have a zero shot model. Essentially, we're over 19. 100% accurate is a preserving number there that we put in there we run very fast, 50 milliseconds that increase about 20 frames per second, running on it as low device as a Jetson nano or ID load, which is basically under 249 MSRP in production. That's a fraction of that cost. In all our demos and all our testing, we have onboard over 250,000 students by nearly downloading the scraping retail websites. That is all it took to know a single image that we can hack for busting. So in terms of scaling, we're showing up at the get go, whether we're doing a small convenience. In store, whether it be a woman, super center, we're matching over 200,000 products and robust identify your products enrollment. We can enroll those 200,000 products in under an hour. So we can literally 45 minutes. So it is very simple and very quick to onboard the store and scale across stores. It was immediate. You don't care about camera placement. We don't care about hardware, and we work with different hardware platforms. You can port algorithms. We're very, very small. We're on the edge. We don't need cloud. Cloud is only there to update database involved. We're already working with WalMart. We have more than 1.4 million ARR with them and 1 million email. People, Fujitsu HP, are also orient partners who have engineering technology and going out and selling their solutions. And there's many other companies who already engage in data logic simply natural. We have speech partnership with P Gen for Ace, and some of my students will pay startups in the Middle East that they want to take in some technology there. So we have multiple fires that we're going after. This is the system that Walmart built. This is the automated receipt checking app system. And our AI is integrated into this camera and multi signal platform. Essentially you you.

58:26much. Okay, our last
S Speaker 101:02:08so if you. So if someone's asking for recommendations for sporting cars with great sound system, so chat GPT, and they give you an answer when you don't know whether it's true or not. Instead, when we got that question, we would actually show people if this is a good recommendation. We show actually in the reviews what people said. It's a sporty it has great stock system. We show people the actual food back. It.

S Speaker 101:02:54Okay. So the last example I want to show you is actually for content creation. We now, just like other generating AI solutions, we can generate product, video content, automatically, but for the stories, the scripts. So again, chatgpt, but you don't know whether it's right or wrong. We actually only generate script that based on video plus authentic we also. Don't use any make fake pictures. We only use authentic real pictures, but we use AI technology make it more compelling, and our video content has as a first industry has already been used by automotive leaders. They are generating more needs batteries that actually have to drive Priyesh, more than 70% regional cars, car sales, and we are currently probably serving, actually six, one more, so 16 leaderships. We. Cut 100% customer engagement the core automotive leadership just the first proven market for us. But we our technology is industry agnostic as well as language agnostic, so we can apply to any more on the market, and we are currently raising 2 million into one more sales and market food so far, before growing organically, and the half more sales, and half for property. So we are allowed first now for the market, popular market. We plan to expand to more work and also also serves the foundations we want to develop. The next one in the pool is the our proprietary NLP technology that holds everything. So thank you. This is our wonderful team, and if you found it interesting, let's have a chat. Thank you
