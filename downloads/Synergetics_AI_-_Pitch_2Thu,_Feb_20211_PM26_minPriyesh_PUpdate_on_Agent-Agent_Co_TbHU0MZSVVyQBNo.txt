Now, when movements are difficult to perform, I can't reach overhead or behind my back, those motions are very painful. Have you taken any pain medication? No. Ever since I had an allergy six months ago, I have not been able to tolerate medicine. Let's check your range of motion. See what we have going on. Does that produce any pain? Right there? Yes, okay. Lateral range of motion is 45 degrees of external rotation. What about this? Yes, right there. Okay. 120 degrees of flexion and 90 degrees of shoulder abduction. Okay. Press outwards in my hands, two out of five on manual muscle testing for external rotation, I am going to check your shoulder capsular mobility. Okay, you have a multi directional capsular restriction from your assessment. You are showing signs that have findings that indicate left

That means they can start and stop. So there is no traceability accountability of agents that nobody's talking about. So we have actually published on LinkedIn, where we have a permanent ID for agents, and that is decentralized ID, which is stored on chain and held in a wallet. Even the region is running or stopped, it can still you can still trace. The traceability is very good with our agents. And in fact, what we're doing now is taking agents from true, AI, line, chain, Salesforce, Agent force and things like that, and wrapping it such that those agents still do what they do, but now they have the capabilities of what we provide, in terms of a wallet, in terms of ID, in terms of decentralized registry, ability to connect to websites, ability to talk with one another. So any agent has all of these capabilities that we offer on top of what we already do. And this was just approved about 10 days ago. Thank you. And then these are our competitors. But because the competitors are vertical agents doing some multi agent we don't consider them as competitors in the sense that we actually can take all the agents and wrap it with our platform so they actually become like competitors. But we can, actually can become our customers as well. And then these agents can operate both in physical plane and as well as the digital plane. So the agent agent communication can happen.

In fact, a lot of people don't know that Tesla cars use their wallet Since 2016 and now the car can actually talk to Wendy's fast food, which is also based on AI. But it's interesting now you will see this autonomous objects talk to one another, which is what we're demonstrating. And in fact, we've built this demo out using jets and nano but we can easily use brain chip, or the cost of inference is very low. So something that we have done on the embedded space, because this is IoT company that I sold. So we look at IoT, is this HPI, nothing else similar equipping

S Speaker 615:58autonomously manage transactions. This setup showcases the sophistication and autonomy of these smart agents in a real world application. The car and parking meter agents are first registered on a common substrate called the agent chain. Agent registry will hold details like agent ID, Agent capabilities, Agent certificates on chain, Agent ratings, supported add ons, etc. The data which is transferred between the agents and Agent chain are completely encrypted for securing the data. We are using the Advanced Encryption Standard, Galois counter mode. It provides both encryption, confidentiality and integrity for data using a unique IV and authentication tag to ensure data integrity and authenticity, operating with a 256 bit key AES. GCM is known for its high security and efficient performance, making it a widely used standard in various applications. When a car wishes to park, the car will send a request to the agent chain about parking meters in close proximity. The agent chain searches for available parking meters in the vicinity and sends this information along with the GPS coordinates and cost per hour to the car, the large language model embedded within the car meticulously evaluates the listed parking meters, considering factors such as distance and cost to determine the optimal choice. Once the best parking meter is selected, the car notifies the agent chain of its decision, which in turn informs the selected parking meter. Upon arriving at the chosen parking meter, the car seamlessly establishes a Bluetooth connection with the meter, enabling secure and efficient interaction. The car and parking meter have embedded within them an ERC 4337 compliant smart contract wallet. This enables each device the ability to participate in autonomous transactions. When the car wishes to initiate a transaction, it initiates a user operation and it digitally signs this transaction. The Signature proves that the car has authorized the transaction by leveraging both ERC 6551 and ERC 4337, the setup allows for a highly autonomous and secure interaction between physical devices and blockchain based smart contracts ensuring that devices can manage their own assets and execute transactions in a decentralized and authenticated manner after the completion of successful payment transactions, the parking meter grants access to the car to park for the requested duration. When the car is ready to leave, it informs the parking meter via Bluetooth. The parking meter then notifies the agent chain, which checks if any additional payment is required in the event the car had occupied the parking spot for longer than the allotted duration. If additional payment is due, the car is informed and initiates the payment process with the agent chain. Once the payment is verified, the car is free to leave, and the parking meter resets its information on the agent chain the same process and drive through,
autonomously manage transactions. This setup showcases the sophistication and autonomy of these smart agents in a real world application. The car and parking meter agents are first registered on a common substrate called the agent chain. Agent registry will hold details like agent ID, Agent capabilities, Agent certificates on chain, Agent ratings, supported add ons, etc. The data which is transferred between the agents and Agent chain are completely encrypted for securing the data. We are using the Advanced Encryption Standard, Galois counter mode. It provides both encryption, confidentiality and integrity for data using a unique IV and authentication tag to ensure data integrity and authenticity, operating with a 256 bit key AES. GCM is known for its high security and efficient performance, making it a widely used standard in various applications.

S Speaker 318:15where are you in terms of deployment as an infrastructure company? Understand the use case, for sure, but we are talking to some of these horizontal agent framework companies as well, through AI being one of them. And what I understand from some of those discussions is many of these agents haven't really, today, reached a production state. Many of these enterprises are still using them for internal experimentation, and then unless that happens, do you see a need for organization to organization, communication, Id wallet transactions today, or do you see the market sort of evolving

S Speaker 118:42in some time down the line. Correct. So question. That's why we have a two wrong. That's why we did sales to enterprise and sales at the telco. So this, this, we think will become, will come to the market second half of the year, even though our technology works, the adoption will happen second half of this year, or maybe probably in the fourth quarter. Now, in the meantime, we are still doing enterprise sales. We have quite a bit of customers. We've done 15 customers right now in the works, and somehow will be live like Optimus, my support is all live and running, and then tele therapy tools is actually in development. So we are past the POC for a lot of them, and then some are in development and so on. But, but I know, I know I hear stories where people are starting by just doing POC, but our real customers, like this morning, we have a customer that does fields support for chain stores, like all the Pizza Huts, all the Walmarts, people like that, and they do all sorts of support on printers, Wi Fi, CCTV camera. So they've got 30,000 key agents, and so they're using a platform to improve their dispatch, improve the service quality, improve the field guide, communicating back to the head office with pictures of the problem, descriptions of any sort of fixes they get in the field and things like that. So a lot of the things that we are doing is real stuff, not POC. I mean, we do a lot of POC is going on to to get people to understand how to use agents on that. I would
in some time down the line. Correct. So question. That's why we have a two wrong. That's why we did sales to enterprise and sales at the telco.

S Speaker 320:02say it's moving away from POC to real life implementation got it. But some of like just being able to advocate your financial services and healthcare are probably the two most apart from legal tech, I'd say, but two of those industries which have started adopting AI agents quite invisibly. And then you would also see there are a lot of vertical, focused companies for these service areas. So if you are generally developing an infrastructure company and at the same time going about enterprise sales in the meantime,
say it's moving away from POC to real life implementation got it. But some of like just being able to advocate your financial services and healthcare are probably the two most apart from legal tech, I'd say, but two of those industries which have started adopting AI agents quite invisibly.

So if you are generally developing an infrastructure company and at the same time going about enterprise sales in the meantime,
S Speaker 120:28how do you see yourself competing with some of those companies? Yeah, so good question. So some of those companies are doing what I call simple agents, which are very horizontal, like record on for example, which is in our list, which does only customer service agents, but CRS, for example, someone who does not do particular agents, they are doing more complex agents, similar to ours. And so there are guys doing this, like there's one Eliza. So they do very simple agents. And we, in fact, play with the agency. It's like a toy, and they don't have fine tuned models. And I can take some fine tune modeling and how to use Lara adapters and those types of things. So these guys are building this non fine tuned model just using a rag, and the results will be, if you know, yeah, it will be horrible, by the way, you know. So some of these players, they raise money, they are selling something, but it cannot be good results. So let me just pause to show you something, because it's very important. What you pointed out? It's very important to understand the difference, because a lot of folks come to us with these questions, and I don't like to give us half answer, so let me see if I can put in the right deck, which is got going forward to show you. So first of all, one of the things that a lot of the folks do is they just do this, and this is good results. We do. We take the out of the box model. We do domain data, sub domain completely, that customer data to find you. Then we use rag in real time to augment that. So that is one aspect where we are very good compared to the rest. There's one more slide in another deck, one second, because it's important. I'll

21:55don't like to bore people with the technical details,
don't like to bore people with the technical details,
don't like to bore people with the technical details,
don't like to bore people with the technical details,
22:02we try to highlight the deep text, so here. So let me
we try to highlight the deep text, so here. So let me
we try to highlight the deep text, so here. So let me
we try to highlight the deep text, so here. So let me
S Speaker 322:13so here what happens is, in our platform, you can play with various levels. If you're sharing something, I'm not able to see that complicated.
so here what happens is, in our platform, you can play with various levels. If you're sharing something, I'm not able to see that complicated.
so here what happens is, in our platform, you can play with various levels. If you're sharing something, I'm not able to see that complicated.
so here what happens is, in our platform, you can play with various levels. If you're sharing something, I'm not able to see that complicated.
S Speaker 122:22So in our platform, we have various levels, and these levels you're able to tune for good quality, latency, of cost, and so for this particular customer, it's based on quality. So you do certain things with the insurance optimization or decoding technique of all kinds of parallelization, quantization, inference, framework and hardware selection. So based on that, we can improve for quality, like this next one, basically just control for cost. This one is controlling for throughput. That means maybe a lot of customers quality generalize it. Generalized advice. So this one is tuned for throughput like this. Now what is also important is some of the customers come to us and say, we have LLM. I don't give you an LLM. So you're looking for LLM for four different departments. You're going to pay Amazon or Azure or GCP a ton of money in terms of your insurance costs. And they say, yeah, the huge bill. And I'll say, Well, let me tell you how to save your money. First of all, you can unify the models. Then use lot adapters. You can get about the same accuracy. But then you can also, each of these use cases can extract only the things that they need, and then when you're running one quarterly infrastructure compared to this. So I want to show you this detailed tech person will understand, because otherwise it's going to be, you know, it's like people don't understand what they're buying, and we're going to get the wrong technology and product and things like that. So we want to be very careful of what we show people and things like that. So So to answer your question, we are quite adept now. To answer the biggest question is in the telco space infrastructure checking out right now as the market develops, we need to establish relationships with Qualcomm. We have a salesperson talking to some division of Hong Kong, not your venture, but in the operation side, and then also pursuing people in Cisco, and getting to Verizon mobile, places like that. And while we do all of that and build the market out for what we have, the kind of a personal advantage, we also have to generate revenue. So a lot of the revenue generation is the current customer pool, and the business actually quite healthy, quite good, in terms of the financials and other things. Myself, you know, a lot of the things I show you, unlike a lot of companies, my Bucha, absolutely, that's a big advantage. And also Brian and myself, if you look at LinkedIn articles, so very good, very, very detailed articles which talk about agents that, and we got a lot of feedback from a lot of people, because these are things that nobody touches on, because don't know many of the innovations that we have made. And a couple more videos which are coming up on agent region, communication vocabularies and so on. So all these things got put in place. And then California, Brian and Coronavirus in Chicago, and then most of teams in Bangalore and so on. We are now raising more money so far. I mean, the last time we spoke, I played about a million, and friends, family and small investors about half million. So about a million and a half is not the company for a seat. Now, we are raising 10 million to go after this big agent, Agent communication part, which we believe second half of the year is going to happen. It's things happen faster than we predict. I fast moving vehicles. on, the feedback has been very good in the market, and I felt that while the feedback from different segments are good, I want to talk to you, because you technically are in the space that we're doing after. So it makes

So you do certain things with the insurance optimization or decoding technique of all kinds of parallelization, quantization, inference, framework and hardware selection. So based on that, we can improve for quality, like this next one, basically just control for cost. This one is controlling for throughput. That means maybe a lot of customers quality generalize it. Generalized advice. So this one is tuned for throughput like this. Now what is also important is some of the customers come to us and say, we have LLM. I don't give you an LLM. So you're looking for LLM for four different departments. You're going to pay Amazon or Azure or GCP a ton of money in terms of your insurance costs. And they say, yeah, the huge bill. And I'll say, Well, let me tell you how to save your money. First of all, you can unify the models. Then use lot adapters. You can get about the same accuracy. But then you can also, each of these use cases can extract only the things that they need, and then when you're running one quarterly infrastructure compared to this. So I want to show you this detailed tech person will understand, because otherwise it's going to be, you know, it's like people don't understand what they're buying, and we're going to get the wrong technology and product and things like that. So we want to be very careful of what we show people and things like that. So So to answer your question, we are quite adept now. To answer the biggest question is in the telco space infrastructure checking out right now as the market develops, we need to establish relationships with Qualcomm. We have a salesperson talking to some division of Hong Kong, not your venture, but in the operation side, and then also pursuing people in Cisco, and getting to Verizon mobile, places like that. And while we do all of that and build the market out for what we have, the kind of a personal advantage, we also have to generate revenue. So a lot of the revenue generation is the current customer pool, and the business actually quite healthy, quite good, in terms of the financials and other things. Myself, you know, a lot of the things I show you, unlike a lot of companies, my Bucha, absolutely, that's a big advantage. And also Brian and myself, if you look at LinkedIn articles, so very good, very, very detailed articles which talk about agents that, and we got a lot of feedback from a lot of people, because these are things that nobody touches on, because don't know many of the innovations that we have made. And a couple more videos which are coming up on agent region, communication vocabularies and so on. So all these things got put in place. And then California, Brian and Coronavirus in Chicago, and then most of teams in Bangalore and so on. We are now raising more money so far. I mean, the last time we spoke, I played about a million, and friends, family and small investors about half million. So about a million and a half is not the company for a seat. Now, we are raising 10 million to go after this big agent, Agent communication part, which we believe second half of the year is going to happen. It's things happen faster than we predict. I fast moving vehicles. on, the feedback has been very good in the market, and I felt that while the feedback from different segments are good, I want to talk to you, because you technically are in the space that we're doing after.
