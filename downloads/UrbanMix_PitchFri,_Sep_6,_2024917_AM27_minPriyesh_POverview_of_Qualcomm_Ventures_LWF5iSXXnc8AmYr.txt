I get that. But yes, how was the event? I could not actually make it in person, but I heard that the event went pretty well.

S Speaker 10:47great companies, great presentations, people from all over the world. They were surprised to see because I'm coming from New York. It was easy for me, but there were people from all over the world. So I guess it was a good opportunity for them to arrive here. So you're based out of New York. Is it pretty interesting? Got it the Qualcomm ventures team, and including myself, we are all based out of the bay area. There are a few members in the in the San Diego office as well. But yeah, most of us in the US investment team are in the Bay Area, and Sharon, I was thinking we could do this this way. I can give you a brief overview about the fund, how we operate, and then we'll like to pass it over to you talk further, and then you can give me an overview.

S Speaker 16:51series, a kind of thing, I understand it's too early, but maybe you have friends or people in the area that are interested in this kind of early stage. So let's see what you think after you'll see that absolutely. Yeah. So open mix is a real estate management platform and with AI operations in 3d which might sound complicated, but it's actually very simple. It's based on the idea that you can manage your building, on your building, or an interactive 3d model of your building, because it's so simple, it makes so much sense. We've seen great tractions just six months from launching our prototype, we are almost at 100k in revenue, and one of the reasons we pulled this off is good. Founders, product fit. Both of us are architects with years of experience and PhDs in urban planning. Dafna, my co founder was the head of the strategic planning department in batyam in Israel, before she joined me in this endeavor, and when she was doing that, she managed over 60,000 residential units from her office with spreadsheets. So we've lived through the frustration of real estate management, and we know that real estate multifamily owners have the exact same problems that asna was having. They manage 1000s of units from their office with many spreadsheets and with every building having its own property manager, contractors, vendors, things fall through the cracks. And if you multiply that across 15 and 20 buildings, turnover loss can eat up to 10% of their annual rent revenue. So the numbers are high here. There's a lot of money in stake, and the pain is across the board with all multifamily owners. And just to recap, the customer in this case, is a multifamily owner or the asset manager in the office. The problem we're dealing with is turnover loss, and what they need is more visibility and better collaboration tools with the teams in the office and with a portfolio of buildings located anywhere in the US. So because we know that problem from personal experience, urban mix delivers exactly this. It gives them real time visibility and enhanced collaboration. So how does it work? Our AI driven through the platform, replicates every building in their portfolio with the exact status of every unit, as you can see on this model, team members get tasks to complete, and when they're done, the 3d model updates, and the unit progress to the next stage, and it becomes like a game, like platform in which we. Not aggregate data from the portfolio. You get a portfolio view to one building with all the tasks that are needed to be completed on that building, and down to the unit level we give we use the model as a storage system to capture everything that is related to a unit inside that unit, allowing real estate owner to be inside the building in one minute and go back to the portfolio scale in the second minute. So we give them a powerful tool like no other in the industry to control their entire portfolio and boost efficiency and revenue.

S Speaker 110:59basic rental Excel sheet. That's a Excel sheet that every real estate company has, so we need from them two very simple things, floor plan and unit roles. If they don't have them, we can also do a 3d scan and create a floor plan ourselves, or create a very rough model based on what we see in Google. But the idea is that that's the IP that we're working on, and it's a pattern pending, and it's something that we're planning to fully automate, so we can create a model like this in in less than a few seconds. At the moment, is part it's partly manual, but it's something that is on our roadmap. And the vision, of course, is much bigger than just

S Speaker 115:10interesting. So task management like you mentioned, are correct me, if I'm wrong, but are those all the maintenance tasks that go in for every unit? Is that correct? At the moment, we are focusing on turnover, so it doesn't include the maintenance, the normal maintenance. We are very early stage, and maybe that's the

S Speaker 117:05a full day just to send them instructions and how to get there and what to do. Here we're creating like a Google map on the building, where all the tasks are mapped to a place and to a thing, and all the information is collected. And you can imagine what a powerful database it becomes. And how can we improve their work when we have this information stored in our system for sure, for sure. Sharon, that sounds very interesting, and that yes, that answers my question. Do you somewhere down the line on your slides? Do you have a product milestone slide on what you plan to be building, and when Yes, yes, I'll start with the traction, yes, the current version, and then I will explain what we plan to so we launched a prototype in February, and we on board and since then, 19 pilot projects live on our platform, five of them are now paying customers, which leads us to almost 50k in revenue, and we're negotiating conversion of a more project that will lead us to almost 100k in revenue. So this is how I started my pitch to show that market is interested in what we're doing, we have six design partners, six real estate companies that are working with us, gave us their data, gave us information about their building, and are giving us product feedback. But product is still prototype mode, so it's not a completely functional. We can't go to people and sell it, because it's not doing the things that we're promising right quite yet. Yes, we do have the platform live. They can see their entire portfolio. They can click in units. I can even show you the Live platform right now, but we are raising money to be exactly to do that, to be able to develop the product to a working, Live platform that will drive revenue for our existing design partners. And that's the goal, to convert all of our design partners to pay customers, which will lead us to 360k revenue, and then do the a round when we are stronger with traction and revenue.

S Speaker 119:40We already have the digital twin idea built in, into the system, and on that we are overlaying the workflow, the turnover workflow of that at the moment, is built in three stages in Spain. To make ready and less. Those are the color codes that you see on the building. And the units are showing exactly which unit is in what stage. And at this time, we are doing the AI overlay, what I explained with the emails and the analytics and integrations to other softwares

S Speaker 120:25trying to starting to have this product used by our design partners, we're also planning to build a more robust renovate workflow, which is all about taking old buildings and renovating them completely while the tenants are living in there. So it's include an RFP and bids workflow and GC marketplace, and that will go all into next year. So that's that's basically where we are right now. That's very interesting, Sharon. And I think the traction you have to show for such an early product is pretty impressive. I can see that there's certainly a need for it. And it sounds interesting, for sure. So you mentioned that's quarter one of 2025,

We are now working on creating different users profiles and that that relates to your question about the tech team we have. We developed a prototype with outsource contract company that built the interface and the digital twin concept for us and the automated automation of taking, you know, floor plans and developing it into a model, and now full time, CTO in the company, was doing the AI and analytics and integration parts. And when this is all stable, we will start also hiring other stuff. But at the moment, it's basically an in house, full time CTO,

And as a fund, we would like to be as opportunistic as possible. We would love to invest in companies which seem interesting at the most earliest stages, so that we can get big allocations. The problem which comes for us is that being a corporate venture fund, we have to involve a lot of our legal team, our finance team, in to making these decisions and just getting the approvals through. So if it's a smaller size check, it does not really move the needle for the other teams as much. So over over time, we have realized that we can do early stage rounds, but it's usually for those companies which are raising a huge 30 million, 50 million seed round, and wherein we can write a check of at least a $2 million thing and get some allocation for it. Writing a smaller check than that is something that the corporate side of things does not make it possible for us.
