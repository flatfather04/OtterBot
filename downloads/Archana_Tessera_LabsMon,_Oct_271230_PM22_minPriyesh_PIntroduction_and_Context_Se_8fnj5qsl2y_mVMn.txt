S Speaker 14:06got it. Got it, Archana, so just just a little bit context, I'm Priyesh. I am one of the newer members of the ventures team I joined probably around the time you joined the team. I was just going through your LinkedIn. So, so being with the Fund for about a year and half about closing to second year, and I just got the intro of tesera Labs from another venture fund that I work closely with. I don't have a lot of context on what these guys do, but they mentioned on the intro email that they've spoken to you they possibly could have a Qualcomm engagement and things like that. So just wanted to understand things from your perspective on how do you see them? And maybe, like your thoughts, would possibly be the best sort of due diligence that we can do on something like this. So just wanted to get a quick understanding of yours.

S Speaker 24:52Yeah, no, happy to connect and just fi right, as you know, I don't know where you joined us from, but as you know, Valley is very connected between all the operators, builders and investors and so people are constantly reaching out, right? Yeah, so

S Speaker 25:09they reached out. I think they're solving for a very interesting problem. And the problem statement is companies like Qualcomm, right are on a very legacy ecosystem of er fees and Salesforce. And when you think about all our processes, right, they are honestly extensive, extensively manual in nature. Qualcomm is notorious

Our systems are on prem, and we are kind of stitching together many different processes. Got it anchoring on Salesforce, and we have like, four Oracle instances and so on, right? So when we think about leveraging AI in our workflows,

S Speaker 26:06have Salesforce. Of course, is an exception. I'll talk about Salesforce in a bit. But ERP and Oracle ERPs, we are on prem. Our ERPs are heavily customized. In fact, it's a collection of, I don't want to quote the number, but it's a collection of multiple applications that we have built around the Oracle code, so to speak, right? So it's not very easy for us to just think about shifting to cloud, and historically, ERP migrations don't have a track record of being successful either, right? Especially when you are consolidated, and when you are moving to the cloud and so on and so forth. So the the embedded AI, which is usually such a quick win for the SaaS platforms, is, is, is not an option, especially when you look at the ER ecosystem, got it.

S Speaker 27:05cloud, right? And we are not a big fan of moving our data around and so on and so forth, right? Because the Asian bricks really works on the premise that Salesforce has access to the data because of the OLTP and the data platform analytics type of data that Asian force really looks at, right? So we haven't really locked ourselves in or even explored, you know, the agent force or the Data Cloud ecosystem. We are just predominantly using their platform for the classic CRM effective, yes, and maybe customer case creation right now, when, when these guys reached out, they're solving a very unique problem, which is

S Speaker 27:53So think about someone. I'm in a finance user, and I want to look at all my pending orders and what that invoicing would look like, right? Today, there is, it's a reporting in analytics ecosystem that we run, however, because they have trained their LLM on the underlying ERP and the Salesforce models, yeah, the upstream process. In this case, I'm just going to call it order to cash right where you have the orders, and as an example, where it crosses the boundaries of these two underlying systems, Salesforce and Oracle, but feel like their LLM, the ability to have an LLM that is trained on the ERP to then enable AI agentic capabilities was something that was, I found that very intriguing, right? Meaning we don't have to go to the cloud, per se. We can

S Speaker 28:55So I asked them about specific use cases, and they said they do like data analysis or master data type of reconciliation and so on, is what I remember. That's what I remember. But I think if they're really solving for a genetic use cases that can learn and understand from our data to then have order processing agent, right? It already knows the data in Salesforce. It already knows the data in Oracle. And then, if it can work to automate through agent, tic, llms, that that would be

I mean, right now we are trying to figure out, you know, build versus buy, yeah, how should we be doing?

I mean, do they actually and I can check with them as well. But just, just want to check if you have, if you can recall something like that, like do have they actually trained it on different data points across the entire ERP ecosystem for different enterprises, and it's very interesting, because I don't know how they captured some of those data points.

S Speaker 210:46I don't think it is trained, and it would be a great follow up with them. I don't think they have, by the way, I never saw the product. This was they said they were still in a stealth mode, right? I had to, I had to even ask them what the name of their product was. I don't think they have trained it on specific enterprises. My guess would be, you know, if you go turn Salesforce on right, you know how Salesforce is an object model, and then you know, Oracle ERP has its underlying database schema. I think they have just trained their models. I don't know who are the representative customers that they have utilized to even train their models.

S Speaker 212:59The cost of moving in an ideal if I wouldn't, if I was in a different company, the strategy would have been, let's just go to SaaS, right? No questions asked. Yeah. You know, we need to be on SAS Salesforce, Adobe. They are a few examples of you already on SAS. The ERP ecosystem is far more complex. So the ERP strategy has been and it's been built over the course of last, whatever, 1520, years, right? We've been building unnatural things on top of ERP. There are multiple store funds we haven't really integrated. And, more importantly, I don't know how much experience you have on ERP type of programs, but Business Process Engineering, right? And we're not specifically very good at, you know, process re engineering, so to speak, right?

13:44Yeah. So I think
13:47the thinking is we don't want to
the thinking is we don't want to
the thinking is we don't want to
the thinking is we don't want to
S Speaker 213:50move everything to cloud right. Now's the time to really peel the onion on everything we have built on our ERPs, and trim it down and where we are, we are, especially from an IT standpoint, we're making investments in cloud and data and in AI infrastructure, right? So we can then bolt on either embedded AI right, where it is available, where it makes sense, leveraging, you know, the standard stack, but also drive more agentic process automation, right? So as an example, we are looking at any 10 that we are plumbing, right. And Natan allows you to orchestrate simple business processes, right? So po creation is one such example where you know, you take the POS and then you orchestrate and submit an Oracle, right? Yeah, now that still has a reliance on the underlying schemas, right, but we are envisioning, and again, I don't have a clear answer to your question, but we are baking these processes into opportunities to see, hey, can we create agents that are working on our orchestration enterprise, AI, data and Cloud platform to then trim the ERP ecosystem and create agentic processes end to end with data outside of the ERPs, right? And into our own data lake as an example. Yeah. And then the standard core functionality what is left behind, like record to revenue and invoicing and so on, that will be a manageable, hopefully, chunk for us to then begin to explore. What does it mean to cloud, right? So I think the short answer, perhaps, is our strategy is still evolving. We want to leverage embedded AI ServiceNow is another platform we do want to leverage embedded AI right where we are on SaaS. We want to leverage where we are not on SAS, I think we are carefully assessing on what that would look like with a combination of our own like qgini or qgini. Yes, I manage the eth Databricks ecosystem, right? How do you really

S Speaker 215:58the process automation, orchestration, agentic processes, rather through this stack to then see what is, what is ERP transformation really look like, absolutely. So I think it's a combination of, I think just our heavy build culture with, you know, our strategy is kind of evolving, and then our process of business is also running very fast, right? So I think that process re engineering muscle

S Speaker 116:26Yeah, I get that original I've been with the team for very small period of time, but I've seen a few cycles of we trying to build something, then we realized maybe a third party application would fit better. In fact, the current Q logic was a deal that I did along with some members of my team in a company called context, and now they custom built something for us internally. So super interesting. And thanks a lot for this. This really clears things out on how I can approach something like this. At the same time, we are looking at a few more spaces that may be very interesting to you. I'm putting a thesis together on Shadow AI detection. So I believe we block a lot of AI applications through the browser, but then some of those applications still seep through. I have a few AI applications that can run on my desktop, a few applications that are not blocked on website. So we are looking at a few solutions which can be much more comprehensive in its outlook. But that's just one example. There are a few other themes that we are very actively targeting in the agentic AI space. So in case, if you are particularly looking at talking to a few of these startups, or sort of trying to get more market intelligence, always happy to connect you to the right folks

S Speaker 121:46absolutely Arjuna. I'll make sure I keep you posted on my end anytime we sort of go through a market and we have a thesis ready, which is probably a couple of pages of a document, I'll make sure I forward some of those to you. But thanks a lot for this. I really appreciated the discussion. I'll keep you posted on how tessera labs evolve, but at the same time on the all the other things that we discussed. Yeah,
