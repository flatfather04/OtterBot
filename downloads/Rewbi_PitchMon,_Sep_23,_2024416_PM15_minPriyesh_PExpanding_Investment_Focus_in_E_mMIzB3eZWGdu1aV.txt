S Speaker 10:31Absolutely, absolutely we can have a chat about that. So I probably want to reach out Thomas, because we are trying to expand our investment focus in electrification. We do see a lot of synergies there, and we internally, we have had a lot of R and D in this space, especially in energy efficiency, Home Energy Management kind of thing, grid operations, grid management platforms, so we're looking into that. And I came across your post on yc. Super interesting. Seems like you have a great team in hand. So congrats on that. And great to know that your round is closed now. So happy to have a chat. Happy to see if I can connect you internally at Qualcomm, and we can take it over from

S Speaker 21:11there. Yeah, definitely. So is Qualcomm involved in installation of battery storage at residences? Or what's the play home thermostat control?

S Speaker 11:22So a lot of these electrification devices or home energy management companies are getting intelligent, if you may, and they do need compute on device. So if you if you have come across span. Span is one of our portfolio companies. They do home energy management. They have a compute unit there for Qualcomm, we try to provide compute units for some of these companies. For you, I believe you may need compute on the premise for some of your battery management systems. And that's where I guess Qualcomm's processes around Snapdragon CDs could come in handy.

2:00Yeah, we used to call that at stamp unit controller.
Yeah, we used to call that at stamp unit controller.

S Speaker 24:10what does it mean for a company to be a good fit? I assume that we need to be beneficial to Qualcomm in some way, not

S Speaker 14:17in like our investment decisions are not really based on that. What we do have an evaluation, and luckily speaking, like in the investment that I create out of the 25 pages, one page would be on strategic fit with Qualcomm. So we explore whether down the line is the company. Can they act as a vendor, a technology supplier, or an M, a target for Qualcomm down the line? So it's something we take a look at it, but it's not really a decision factor for us.

S Speaker 24:48Yeah. Okay, so in our case, it would be when we expand into it. We're not doing this today, but as we expand into on site unit control areas, there's a huge opportunity for us to partner with Qualcomm in terms of on site connectivity, and that could be interesting.
Yeah. Okay, so in our case, it would be when we expand into it. We're not doing this today, but as we expand into on site unit control areas, there's a huge opportunity for us to partner with Qualcomm in terms of on site connectivity, and that could be interesting.

S Speaker 15:02Absolutely, absolutely. In fact, for the electrification thesis, I am working with a couple of business units internally who do see this as a very growing area for Qualcomm to become a market leader act. So I'm happy to make those connections, I guess, down the time and down the line, when you have that scale, that would be a very beneficial connection for you to explore. Yeah, okay, so

S Speaker 16:52Got it? Got Can you break that down for me, Thomas and I understand you've had a lot of these discussions during the entire fundraising call, so I don't want to be, I don't want to be too heavy on you. But can you break the entire business model for me, just for my curiosity, how does that work? Who takes the downsides of the entire proposition? What kind of metrics do you see in the entire business model? Fit in?

7:35So can you see my screen? Okay, yes, I can see.
S Speaker 27:45Yeah. So the delta between a top performing battery and a poorly performing battery, based on the quality of the optimization decisions being made on that battery is 4x so by optimization, I mean, when do you charge? When do you discharge? Yes, electricity prices are super volatile. They change by 300% or more over the course of just a 15 minute triple so if you discharge, about discharge battery, even just a little bit too late, you could lose half your revenue for that, right? So batteries are super sensitive the decisions that you make on them, so we rent out batteries. So mediocre battery might earn 90k per year. We rent it out for 80 because we're providing a long term hedge, we're taking on the costs of the optimization decision making, and then we can make $180,000

S Speaker 18:28That's very interesting. I guess it's a solution right there in front of you. And that's that's very exciting, that you can achieve such metrics. Thomas like is the broader value proposition, just the price difference between different charging points. And I know for grids, they see this as something that would give them more resiliency down the line. And they're trying to sort of optimize for EV storage, peak, non peak, commercial storage kind of thing. Do you think just battery optimization would be able to move the needle for them? Yeah. So

S Speaker 29:07the it's not it's not about a delta at various points. It's about the quality of decisions that are being made. So you said Asia and machine learning in order to predict the chance that a battery is going to make a significant amount of money in a triple great, because black swan events are way more common in the electricity market than in other markets. As then it would be like stock market crash is basically guaranteed to happen three to seven times per year. So if there's even just say, a 10% chance tomorrow at six times is going to be 5% of your revenue for the year, you better be prepared to operate. So we use our base approach to forecasting to make better decisions for the battery.

S Speaker 19:45Very interesting, very interesting. And do you eventually sell to utilities?
Very interesting, very interesting. And do you eventually sell to utilities?
Very interesting, very interesting. And do you eventually sell to utilities?
Very interesting, very interesting. And do you eventually sell to utilities?
S Speaker 29:52No, we sell to the grid operator, which is bit different from utility. So it's the price that you get paid for power. And we're already a regulated power company in Texas, which which is super hard to do, but we did it just a few months. Yeah. So the basically, what's going on here is that, like the market pays us for every unit of power that we produce, and that the amount that we get paid isn't it's not paid by the utility. It's paid by the market based on the price of electricity at the time that the power is produced, got it. Got it. We're renting. We're renting from independent power producers, as opposed to utility companies. Got

S Speaker 110:34it, got it. I can imagine my days back in India where we would sort of project the wind and solar generation patterns, and it would the peak part load would always put us back. So the project financials was so off. We tried using carbon credits to sort of offset a charge a part of those costs, but a battery optimization would have been such an amazing solution back then. I can totally imagine that. How granular in terms of charging time units do you go? Thomas,
it, got it. I can imagine my days back in India where we would sort of project the wind and solar generation patterns, and it would the peak part load would always put us back.

S Speaker 111:06So how granular in terms of decision making, do you go? Do you go for 15 minute time slots? Do you go? Even granular than that,
So how granular in terms of decision making, do you go? Do you go for 15 minute time slots? Do you go? Even granular than that,
So how granular in terms of decision making, do you go? Do you go for 15 minute time slots? Do you go? Even granular than that,
So how granular in terms of decision making, do you go? Do you go for 15 minute time slots? Do you go? Even granular than that,
S Speaker 211:17so down to five minutes. Okay, that's pretty ERCOT with two components of the price at the moment. And ERCOT is always changing the way that the price is calculated. But the the settlement point price is composed the local marginal price plus all of the price adders. And so you can actually target five from the pricing. Very interesting, yeah, which is super, super difficult to do, but again, making a probabilistic based decision leads to a significantly better outcome,
so down to five minutes. Okay, that's pretty ERCOT with two components of the price at the moment. And ERCOT is always changing the way that the price is calculated.

S Speaker 111:47like, do you track the accuracy of your models? Do you see that improving over time? How's that proposition?
like, do you track the accuracy of your models? Do you see that improving over time? How's that proposition?
like, do you track the accuracy of your models? Do you see that improving over time? How's that proposition?
like, do you track the accuracy of your models? Do you see that improving over time? How's that proposition?
S Speaker 211:55Yeah. I mean, I understand all the data required in order to build a phenomenal price forecast, and I'd say we're only halfway there. You know, it's like, amazing that we have a state of the art model after three months. Last time I did this, it took me two years. Yeah, there's more to do, yeah, but you track the accuracy of your models in a couple of ways. One is by simulating revenue on an actual storage facility. Two is by checking ma PE and Mae, so like performance metrics. The third way that you track, just to make sure I'm answering your question, is through other proxies, like, how well could you trade electricity features with the strategy? That's another good proxy to determine whether or not you're better at pricing the market compared to your competitors. And then I'd say that the last mechanism, and this is unintuitive, but you need to know whether or not the data that you expect to arrive is arriving on path consistently, like if your weather models late half the time, it leads to significant forecast performance deviation. So it's not like, Okay, if the data were there, how would my model perform? It's, How
Yeah. I mean, I understand all the data required in order to build a phenomenal price forecast, and I'd say we're only halfway there.
