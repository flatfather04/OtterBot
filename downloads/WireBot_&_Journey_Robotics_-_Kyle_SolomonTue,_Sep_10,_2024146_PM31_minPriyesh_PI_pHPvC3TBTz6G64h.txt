S Speaker 10:27I'm doing great. It's a beautiful day here in New York City. Okay, you're based in New York is it? Yes, I'm based on the Upper East Side of New York City. Got it? Got it? Yeah, I would have loved to meet in person, but I could not actually make to the summit in in person, so, but still glad that we found time to chat. Yeah, absolutely. Where are you based out in California? Yes, yes. The team, including myself, we are all based out of the Bay Area. And we have a couple of other investors in San Diego, where the Qualcomm headquarter is

1:04a good place down in San Diego, right? Oh, yeah,
S Speaker 11:06absolutely. I know. I know there is a reason why some of these members don't want to move to the Bay Area. I don't how long have you been in the Bay Area? Not for long, actually. So I was in LA previous to that this and I've moved, I guess, three months back, yeah, okay. I like LA, LA's. I have some really good friends that live in LA one, like both of them are in Santa Monica, yeah, which is, which is a great, great spot.
absolutely. I know. I know there is a reason why some of these members don't want to move to the Bay Area. I don't how long have you been in the Bay Area? Not for long, actually.

for 2 billion. So it was a pretty decent amount of growth. Absolutely.
S Speaker 15:34Yeah, yes, exciting times, for sure. My brother ultimately ended up being the CEO there, which was fun. So we got to work together for 12 years, 10 of which I ran the deriv desk and built that business to about 50 million bucks. And then I had an opportunity to move into our investment bank, which is not a really traditional move. I got to move there because I grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, even though I've been here in New York. My brother, who was the CEO, also a Pittsburgher in New York, and then all this innovation and disruption around if you know, you have to be intimately involved in Carnegie Mellon University, if you're looking at AI, but like CMU and life sciences coming out of the University of Pittsburgh, there's a ton of innovation and disruption that comes out of Pittsburgh and and some of those companies started to mature. So we're seeing companies across the on the spectrum, across the spectrum. And I said, I said to my brother, I was like, have we decided to have somebody there yet? Because there's so much going on, fits our investment banking verticals really nicely? Yeah, I would love to do that. Because I would love to spend more time in Pittsburgh. I'd love to get to know Pittsburgh and that business ecosystem much differently than I had in the past. So I decided to flip into the investment bank, and that's where a bunch of the opportunities that I've I left count one at the end of last summer is to kind of pursue some of the relationships that I had. I put together a portfolio of work, and so I've been, I've been working with five companies, very different, some capital raising, some business advisory. But the two I wanted to chat with you about both emanate from contacts in Pittsburgh. So there's a guy that I met in Pittsburgh who lives in Israel. He runs an organization called 412 by 972 he's so 412 is Pittsburgh's area code, 972 is Israel's area code, and that organization works on developing business ties and technology between Israel and Pittsburgh, both being technology innovation hubs, right? Innovation Hubs. And so I've worked with, I've worked with his name is Kyle ember. I worked with him closely on a couple different projects. So, so one of them is as a company that I, that I, I really fell in love with, in a sense of, I think about companies that are solving problems, that are there already, right? That's just, that's my DNA. Like, there's a problem, yeah. And then you have companies that obviously find solutions to those problems, as opposed to, like, we have some great technology, we have a solution. Let's go find a problem. Agree. And so both the companies I'm talking to you about today or presenting to you, I think, have done that and and. So wire bot is the first company. So wire bot is a an Israeli based company. They are a robotic wiring system for electric electrical cabinets. So if you think of these big electrical cabinets, data centers in warehouses and distribution centers in big industrial buildings, big residential buildings. They have these big industrial sort of electrical cabinets, and they need some pretty decent precision wiring, obviously, to make that work. So that's all been done by hand forever. A lot of the a lot of the specialty around wiring cabinets are aging out. A lot of the employees are retiring. They're going into other things, and it's not being replaced. It's a it's a theme that we see many times over, which I'm sure is familiar to you. And so their solution is, is a workstation that has an arm that wires these cabinets. So it addresses the shortage of labor, it improves productivity, improves quality, reduces cost and labor waste and and it also is four or five times as efficient as a human being, right? So checks all those boxes of what robotics does and automation does. They have seven patents that are submitted and and they, from a traction standpoint, they secured bookings from customers. So they're, they don't, we don't really have a name for the round. They're probably series A because they're raising $15 million at a $45 million valuation. So that really looks like, is that free or post? So it's 45 free. Okay, yeah, and, and so they secure bookings from customers. They have a strategic partnership with vago, which is a billion, you know, multi billion dollar company in Europe. They have a collaboration with Siemens, and they're engaged in a bunch of other meaningful discussions with several, you know, billion dollar plus European industrial giants that are exploring either design part and discern relationships as design partners or customers. They're being spun out of an incubator. So there's an incubator in Israel called polygon. And polygon builds these companies from a technology base, and so they're being spun out in front of this capital raise. Their bookings this year are probably going to be about one and a half to 2 million bucks as we get towards the end of the year, 650 grand already booked. They have about 1,000,003
Yeah, yes, exciting times, for sure. My brother ultimately ended up being the CEO there, which was fun.

S Speaker 113:56that product is commercially available, but they have the team to go ahead and execute also, that's that's very interesting, Kyle, and thanks a lot for the overview. I'd say, more recently, we have started looking at robotics with a new enthusiasm altogether, given that some of these new AI models have unlocked a lot of capabilities which could not exist earlier, we have been looking, and we are actively talking to a few other precision robotics companies in the US. So this certainly fits that thesis. And very broadly speaking, we also feel like we are also very broadly bullish on the growth of data centers. So it does align with that as well. Having a great team is a big plus, especially for some of these early teams where there is no a lot, not a lot of deployment. So that that can certainly align. Well, am I right in saying that there aren't any deployed robots yet for them, that is, that is correct. So they say they have, I believe, sold some components, but the full machine, the form of the full robotic cell. Yeah, will be done sometime in in mid next year. Understood, understood, read it. By the

now I'll see you right here, if you throw it in the chat operator,
S Speaker 117:20I realized my booking ID does not give you access to my email. I'll have to change that. No, no problem. I'm gonna take it right from here. Perfect. I got it. I think

S Speaker 117:43Qualcomm. I mean, that's Qualcomm. I just got there, that's Qualcomm calling. No, that's, so that's wire bot. The other company I wanted to talk to you about is, is journey robotics. So journey robotics is a another robotics company. They are. They are based in in Pittsburgh, and they are a an airport and airline automation company, yeah, and, and so they they might look like a startup, but they are. They're not, and I'm actually part of the founding team. So when I say, when I say they, I mean, we, yeah. And so I met these guys again through some of my contacts in Pittsburgh and and again, it's been really exciting to be back in that ecosystem. So airport and airline automation, they're, they're built to roboticize and automate the commercial aviation services industry. And so if you think about it, they are specializing in robotics beyond the factory floor, and have some amazing experience. And so yes, we're actually raising a seed round, but the the the other founding members of the team, two of which are from Carnegie Mellon University, worked for a company in Pittsburgh, car re squared that was sold at the end of, I think, 2021 to Sarcos, which is a publicly traded robotics company, for $100 million but the team all comes from RE squared, and they Were the hardware team, and they were working on three different verticals. One was robots in deploying and installing solar fields, underwater robotics. And then the third was this airport aviation, specifically around baggage handling and air airplane servicing. The team that I've hooked up with is the team that was focused on that baggage handling solution and airplane servicing. So Sarcos, that publicly traded company, decided that they wanted to focus on technology as there was a downturn in hardware, they were kind of making sure that their books were solid. They ended up leaving the hardware space in general, to focus on software, and it really created an opportunity for these guys to go ahead and continue what they were building when they were at their prior shop. So they have five years of actual r&d around spirals and prototypes and baggage handling. They've all got all the nicks and bruises and cuts and learnings from what worked and what didn't work. And now we're out on our own with our own IP, taking those sort of that experience, taking those customers that they had built over the last five years and in the last seven months, customers understanding the market that all that know how, and building a baggage handling a baggage handling system prototype. So there's our initial product is going to be baggage handling indoors. So if you think about it like you go to an airport, you drop your bag off, it heads down the belt, right? It gets unloaded, put on a truck, and then taken out to the plane. Our first product is actually going to be waiting in the baggage room inside to unload those baggages to come and put them on the cart, yeah, and then the car takes them to the plane. So again, we have a ton of experience, but as a as a newer company, we want to focus on on one area, folks. The second horizon would be baggage handling outdoors. So you have the two inside baggage, unloading and loading. Inside baggage, loading and unloading to the plane outside. And then you have the third horizon, which is airport servicing air. Sorry, airplane servicing. And so if you think about a plane, it's called gate turn servicing a plane pulls into the gate, yeah, right. And there's a bunch of things that happen. There's ground power unit connection, there's water refueling, laboratory services, all those connections can be automated. And so that is our third so it's all about turning the airplane around quicker, right? Because the more that the airplane is in the air, the more the airlines are making money, the more the air airports get planes in and out, the more money they make by renting the places. And if you think about it again, around baggage handling, the reason why we know it's a toothache for the for the industry, both airlines and airports, is that we're part of a bag, an international baggage work, baggage handling working group
Qualcomm. I mean, that's Qualcomm. I just got there, that's Qualcomm calling. No, that's, so that's wire bot. The other company I wanted to talk to you about is, is journey robotics. So journey robotics is a another robotics company. They are. They are based in in Pittsburgh, and they are a an airport and airline automation company, yeah, and, and so they they might look like a startup, but they are. They're not, and I'm actually part of the founding team. So when I say, when I say they, I mean, we, yeah. And so I met these guys again through some of my contacts in Pittsburgh and and again, it's been really exciting to be back in that ecosystem. So airport and airline automation, they're, they're built to roboticize and automate the commercial aviation services industry. And so if you think about it, they are specializing in robotics beyond the factory floor, and have some amazing experience. And so yes, we're actually raising a seed round, but the the the other founding members of the team, two of which are from Carnegie Mellon University, worked for a company in Pittsburgh, car re squared that was sold at the end of, I think, 2021 to Sarcos, which is a publicly traded robotics company, for $100 million but the team all comes from RE squared, and they Were the hardware team, and they were working on three different verticals. One was robots in deploying and installing solar fields, underwater robotics. And then the third was this airport aviation, specifically around baggage handling and air airplane servicing. The team that I've hooked up with is the team that was focused on that baggage handling solution and airplane servicing. So Sarcos, that publicly traded company, decided that they wanted to focus on technology as there was a downturn in hardware, they were kind of making sure that their books were solid. They ended up leaving the hardware space in general, to focus on software, and it really created an opportunity for these guys to go ahead and continue what they were building when they were at their prior shop. So they have five years of actual r&d around spirals and prototypes and baggage handling. They've all got all the nicks and bruises and cuts and learnings from what worked and what didn't work. And now we're out on our own with our own IP, taking those sort of that experience, taking those customers that they had built over the last five years and in the last seven months, customers understanding the market that all that know how, and building a baggage handling a baggage handling system prototype.

S Speaker 122:33companies and and 25 airports, and they are trying to figure out and understand how best to automate and robotize back channeling. We have strong relationships internationally. So not only do we have relationships here in the US, with places like Orlando, with New York, with Pittsburgh International, so we're actually part of Pittsburgh International's expert program Pittsburgh is opening up a new airport in 2025 that's in our backyard. Yeah, so we're actually going to be able to take our prototype that we're building and put it inside some of the older areas in Pittsburgh International to make sure that it can we gain all the knowledge that we need, both from a vision standpoint, from a spatial standpoint, to then go ahead and deploy it both inside the US and internationally. Some of the relationships internationally are Skipper airport in Amsterdam, Avenue in Norway, IG in in London, Frankfurt. Sorry, Frankfurt in Germany. And when I look at it again, the thing that got me excited about this because I could not only I only have so much time to spend, right, and I want to be excited about who and where I spend at that it really is the team and their knowledge around it. And so they have, we have 50 customers are aware that we're around. We have general interest from nine. We're starting some customer discovery with six in particular, and we have six that we feel like there is potential for proposal scoping. So the reason that we're raising money currently is to build that prototype with the new IP, where actually our end of arm tool, the gripper, the grabber for the bag, is that secret sauce, that secret that secret sauce, where we have defendable IP, so we have a provisional patent that we're getting on that end of arm tool, and nobody else is doing it. So super excited about that. It's been there. They've got it. They understand, by the way, non dilutive funding also. So there's a ton of non dilutive funding, some customer sponsored research. And they've done that in the past. So I think that's, that's where I'll leave it. I'll leave it there. I'm happy to answer any questions, but I'll leave you with this. I think when we look at the company in five years, because we projected it out, our best case scenario at this point is our medium case, I should say, is 32 million bucks in revenue, 5 million bucks and five to 6 million bucks in EBITDA. And I think our verticals will be baggage, handling, indoor now Tory and that gate team and that gate turn servicing. So really, really excited about the team and what we're able to accomplish, there certainly sounds interesting. Kyle, I was some very few follow up questions. I can imagine, with all of the three rollouts, including the gate servicing the market could be huge, but just for the first prototype, just for baggage and loading and loading, do you see enough value in the product? And what could the account sizes, sort of subscription revenues could look like?

And what could the account sizes, sort of subscription revenues could look like?
26:13the account size could look like? Oh, yeah. So,
S Speaker 126:17so we're we're weighing both the capex model and the RAS model robotics as a service, yeah. And again, I think that we see steady growth over them over the next five years. So I think that in we in 18 months, we should have our full prototype built. And again, it's, if you think about it, it's actually third generation, even though it's our first generation, and that should be deployed in Pittsburgh International Airport within 18 months. And then we look at paid pilots, paid pilot programs coming from there. So I think it looks like again, in 2027 we're looking at being profitable, right? And that comes from a mix of both airlines and airports. Is that, did that answer your question to some extent, yes, yes. I guess. Do you have this number? Do you have the payback period for the robots projected somewhere? So you're talking for the RAS model. Yeah, yeah. So it looks like so the the robot itself is probably going to cost somewhere around 150 grand. And so our gut is, is that we should be able to pay that back. And again, we're still working through the RAS model. My guess is two things. One, as an early company, there are financing solutions where we can go out and lease right, work with equipment leasing companies to be able to have them buy the actual machine, we charge a big right, so we don't necessarily have to have that capital upfront, at least initially, but I think the payback period is probably somewhere in order of and again, it's a little bit of a guess. It's probably somewhere within one and a half to two years. Fair enough. That's, that's usually the ballpark, which works for us. So that's, that's interesting for sure, Kyle and Yeah, happy to take a look at it as well. If you could send me some materials, I will do my own research, probably speak to some members in the team, and then we can set up a follow up call to have a chat in a little bit more detail. Perfect. So just to give you a round journey. Just to give you some sense of when we're raising money, we're probably not going to be raising money till October, so we have a little bit of time. Yeah, we're finishing up all of the material, both the pitch deck and our financials. It was funny, there was a great summit at the at the event in New York, where there were, there were five sort of VCs, both on the court, from the corporate side and from traditional VC and I think one guy summed it up great. He goes, the model is basically an effort in creative writing, because we've never received a model that in five years look the same as the one we got five years ago. Yeah, agreed, agreed, for sure. But if we're finishing those numbers up, and so I should be able to get you some information, some some more detailed information around journey, hopefully within the next few weeks. Absolutely, that would be great, Kyle, and I certainly do appreciate the Reach Out Kyle and like, like you mentioned, does seem like you've had a lot of successes in your life so far, and you're very well plugged in into the entire Pittsburgh ecosystem. So down the line, if you come across any other come any other opportunities which could be interesting to Qualcomm, I'm always happy to take a look at it. Great. I really appreciate that, and I look forward to dialoguing about these, and I'm sure there will be a few others. Also, I agree with six, exciting time in robotics, obviously around the AI exposure, but, you know, the hardware side of robotics was a darling, and then it kind of fell off, and everybody was sort of focused on technology, and I think valuations are at the right point now where people realize that you actually need that hardware component. And so I think we're at the beginning of that sort of next move higher for hardware paired up, obviously, nicely with all the new software, right? For sure. I agree. Great. Well, I will, I will let you get back at it. I'll shoot you an email, just so you have all my information. I'll send you some information, some additional information on wire bot, and we'll make that connection, and I'll send you information around journey for sure. Looking forward to it. Appreciate your time. Yes, yes.
so we're we're weighing both the capex model and the RAS model robotics as a service, yeah. And again, I think that we see steady growth over them over the next five years.

And again, it's, if you think about it, it's actually third generation, even though it's our first generation, and that should be deployed in Pittsburgh International Airport within 18 months. And then we look at paid pilots, paid pilot programs coming from there. So I think it looks like again, in 2027 we're looking at being profitable, right? And that comes from a mix of both airlines and airports. Is that, did that answer your question to some extent, yes, yes. I guess. Do you have this number? Do you have the payback period for the robots projected somewhere? So you're talking for the RAS model. Yeah, yeah. So it looks like so the the robot itself is probably going to cost somewhere around 150 grand. And so our gut is, is that we should be able to pay that back. And again, we're still working through the RAS model. My guess is two things. One, as an early company, there are financing solutions where we can go out and lease right, work with equipment leasing companies to be able to have them buy the actual machine, we charge a big right, so we don't necessarily have to have that capital upfront, at least initially, but I think the payback period is probably somewhere in order of and again, it's a little bit of a guess. It's probably somewhere within one and a half to two years. Fair enough. That's, that's usually the ballpark, which works for us. So that's, that's interesting for sure, Kyle and Yeah, happy to take a look at it as well. If you could send me some materials, I will do my own research, probably speak to some members in the team, and then we can set up a follow up call to have a chat in a little bit more detail. Perfect. So just to give you a round journey. Just to give you some sense of when we're raising money, we're probably not going to be raising money till October, so we have a little bit of time. Yeah, we're finishing up all of the material, both the pitch deck and our financials. It was funny, there was a great summit at the at the event in New York, where there were, there were five sort of VCs, both on the court, from the corporate side and from traditional VC and I think one guy summed it up great. He goes, the model is basically an effort in creative writing, because we've never received a model that in five years look the same as the one we got five years ago. Yeah, agreed, agreed, for sure. But if we're finishing those numbers up, and so I should be able to get you some information, some some more detailed information around journey, hopefully within the next few weeks. Absolutely, that would be great, Kyle, and I certainly do appreciate the Reach Out Kyle and like, like you mentioned, does seem like you've had a lot of successes in your life so far, and you're very well plugged in into the entire Pittsburgh ecosystem. So down the line, if you come across any other come any other opportunities which could be interesting to Qualcomm, I'm always happy to take a look at it. Great. I really appreciate that, and I look forward to dialoguing about these, and I'm sure there will be a few others. Also, I agree with six, exciting time in robotics, obviously around the AI exposure, but, you know, the hardware side of robotics was a darling, and then it kind of fell off, and everybody was sort of focused on technology, and I think valuations are at the right point now where people realize that you actually need that hardware component. And so I think we're at the beginning of that sort of next move higher for hardware paired up, obviously, nicely with all the new software, right? For sure. I agree. Great. Well, I will, I will let you get back at it. I'll shoot you an email, just so you have all my information. I'll send you some information, some additional information on wire bot, and we'll make that connection, and I'll send you information around journey for sure. Looking forward to it. Appreciate your time. Yes, yes.
