Speaker 2
So yeah, I think maybe some context, because we haven't spoken about this in the most most of the conversation has been over email. So I am with the ventures team, and we typically interface with a lot of starters, that how I that is how I had met Daniel and two house. So our job is also to sort of work with some of our business units, try to see if there are any partnerships, and then we connect some companies we are close to to them. So in this case, I have limited information right now, I'm trying to act as, say, the first cut filter for some of our for the business unit use case here. So happy to give you some context. But I think the way this process would be, I can give you an overview of what the mobile business unit is looking for, some ideas on where, how you, I feel, you can contribute, and then we'll make an introduction to the specific business unit, the mobile business unit in the system, and the actual pitching and the discussions on how to co develop a solution and things like that would be taken over

so Orlando here. The context is that Qualcomm is developing their next set of flagship mobile chips. Now these these chips typically go in some of the most flagship Android phones, Samsung, iommis, OPOs, and a lot of other OEMs. And what we have been trying to do over the last couple of years is have more AI inference capabilities in our chips. Our plan here is to also demonstrate that along with the chip, we can run some of these workloads on device itself. So there is this interesting case study out there in the web. I think that will give you a lot of context. Let me just drop the link over here. Sounds good. I

Speaker 1
And do you know, like, I guess you're like, you know, this is like, the first child we're having. Does the mobile business unit like, do they have already established their partners that they're going to work with on the like, the startups, or are they starting now, and

Speaker 2
they are starting now. So they they The plan is to evaluate companies in April. I think it's it's slightly late, but I think they have probably 10 more days to to work with a few startups and partners that they will work together with. They will have a discussion with you to understand if there are any solutions that you can COVID with them and have those workloads run on device itself, the plan is to have a demo by September, and as the PPT would have outlined, I guess. And once that is ready, they are willing to make introductions to a lot of mobile OEMs have the technology or the solution, kind of natively branded with some of these mobile OEMs make a lot of PR push behind this. Make it very publicly accessible across a lot of platforms where Qualcomm and present, so they're willing to put their marketing and GTM efforts behind this.

Speaker 2
yes. So the, it's a what, what we get out of it is we get to demonstrate that we have AI solutions working natively on device. And what this means is that for the partners, you don't have to run it on Cloud, they you have cost, latency and privacy benefits and all of that. So that's that's the value proposition we are trying to push same time, at least for tool tool house, what I know is mobile BU is looking for some agentic solutions that can run on mobile, and main be mobile first, rather than a PCS dev workflow. So I understand tool house is more of a horizontal agent creation platform. So here, I think the discussion with business units needs to be that let's, let's have these couple of set of agent tech workflows that we can run on mobile and have that sort of pushed through as one tool, browser solution. Sounds
yes. So the, it's a what, what we get out of it is we get to demonstrate that we have AI solutions working natively on device.

highlight bunch of kind of logistical questions, like, will we be given, like an emulator or an SDK so we can start, like, building ourselves, but you anticipated, like you probably have, not this kind of context, so we'll wait to get into the business unit, and we'll ask those questions.

Speaker 2
Well, that's nice. I think the last time we were discussing, we didn't see, or I don't remember seeing the Mobile SDK, so good to see. Have that as well. Maybe we can get some commercial use cases out of it right away.
Well, that's nice. I think the last time we were discussing, we didn't see, or I don't remember seeing the Mobile SDK, so good to see. Have that as well. Maybe we can get some commercial use cases out of it right away.

Speaker 3
Yeah, you didn't get to see the financials. You will see that we are located account for, for a mobile engineer, especially to get on mobile, yeah, yeah,

Speaker 1
like a person that's fully dedicated to just build for mobile, rather than, like, you know, one of our engineers is like, messing around with code. We know we want someone to be 24/7
