So still under discussion about that, and we have three other investors who are everyone wish to have more than 5 million in that round. So I think that's very hard for us to promise everyone for that.

S Speaker 27:08Um, I think, like, like, you, you tell me before you said, like, you guys want to get in this round instead of next round. Yeah, and I think I get it, and depending on I think it's definitely I would love to I love the conversation, and I would love to cooperate, but I don't know how much percentage, but because you told me there's certain percentage and certain amount you want to put in there, right? So I do not know that the number yet. So I need to know the number first. Then I need to work with my old investor and the rest of the investors to see how to balance everyone. The only thing is, like, I'm really honest to sure is I really like you, and I really like Priyesh, and, you know, like, I have been interviewed for Qualcomm, right? So there's some history there. The only thing is, they give us term sheet, you know, like few weeks ago, right? So, like we
Um, I think, like, like, you, you tell me before you said, like, you guys want to get in this round instead of next round.

And then I mean red point is a good brand,
And then I mean red point is a good brand,
And then I mean red point is a good brand,
S Speaker 28:18depending on how much amount, and what is the percentage that you need for this round, then we can, you know, discuss with them, and I will try my best to negotiate for that. But yeah, so I will see is like, to be honest, for the red point, they actually do get a little bit better price than rest of investors. The only reason is because, you know, first of all, they give us term sheet like, you know, like three, four weeks before all other investors. They are the first one who give us the term sheet, and they are the leader, lead investor. And also, they give us pretty good terms. Those are the reasons. But the thing is, we try to get all the investor we love in the second close, which is a little bit higher than the first one, but it's roughly like 93 that's the price. Oh, okay, so what I'm

S Speaker 19:28but the total size of the round is still 15,
but the total size of the round is still 15,
but the total size of the round is still 15,
but the total size of the round is still 15,
S Speaker 29:34yes, so right now we are thinking about 15, but maybe it will Go up to 17. So the thing is, because, like, we, if you guys, want to join this round, I am considering whether I will take another investors as well. Because it's like, we are already too many people in the either one round, right? So the thing is, like, if the old investor exists in Prada. We want to ensure at least, you know, like seven to 8 million left for rest of the investors for that, and probably will take another two investors in total, yeah.
yes, so right now we are thinking about 15, but maybe it will Go up to 17.

S Speaker 110:15Okay, so that's good. Thank you. So now where we are in our diligence. One, we're trying to figure out the business unit partnership as well. I think it'll be a good thing. The second thing where we have questions from our team is the competitive dynamics, which is so we're spending Priyesh and I were spending more time doing some more diligence from like ad agencies. And this is where we are from ad agencies and how they view the market and and which is, can you build a sizable business addressing SMBs and prosumer market itself, and then what matters to which is the cost of switching. Because some of the data points that we have received from several players, what we've seen is many players in this space have seen viral growth over the last year, and many players have reached, you know, similar levels and some higher some lower, levels of viable growth. So the difference that we've seen is you've got a unique ideation engine, and I think your story around closing a loop is the differentiated
Okay, so that's good. Thank you. So now where we are in our diligence. One, we're trying to figure out the business unit partnership as well. I think it'll be a good thing.

S Speaker 115:38service. Agree? Ellen, I mean, I think that's that part. I I mean, that's the differentiator for for creating, yeah, and then that could potentially be so what we want, what we're trying to get more data points around, is, can we get more? Because right now, since you have 14 months of data, so that data that you have is not as it cannot guarantee. It cannot point in that direction for sure, right? So, when you have two years of data, then, then I think it can point in that direction, but, but so we're trying to figure out, where do we collect data to prove that hypothesis could be true? Now, of course, after a certain point, we'll have to trust, make the leap of faith, like that's the bet, but, but we are trying to collect data points as much as possible to to say that that is that can be the long term differentiator or community so, so now, I mean, so we're talking to some agencies. We We would also, if you can connect us to some customers, to customers that would be great. If you can connect us to two customers that we can speak with and understand their experience, that would be great. And and then somebody at Redpoint, so that, I think that's the which is either speak with red point or get that report something we know red point. I was just in a board meeting with the red point guys this morning. So we're, we're in investors, co investors, together. We know that well. So if we can speak with whoever's leading at Redpoint, then that, then I think like we would have collected enough data
service. Agree? Ellen, I mean, I think that's that part.

I mean, the key in this space, Ella, mainly, is,
S Speaker 120:57which is, how do you like? How do you continue to differentiate against competitors? Right which is, right now you've got lot of companies that are they have different angles to go after this market. And right now, I can tell you, everybody's got viral.

S Speaker 121:39yeah, yeah. And then your, your long term vision on, on this, which is automation of this, l4 at agency. I think that's a, yeah, that's a good, ambitious mission,
yeah, yeah. And then your, your long term vision on, on this, which is automation of this, l4 at agency. I think that's a, yeah, that's a good, ambitious mission,

S Speaker 221:53yeah, yeah. So I think there's two things, like first one you mentioned, everyone is having a viral post there, right? So I do think that, like, to be honest, I think there will be a lot of players in the end, it will not be like one winner takes all, at least, I think for this video space, because video space is so huge, right? Like we are so many different use cases in the space, so many like needs. So I do think there will be multiple players, you know that.
yeah, yeah. So I think there's two things, like first one you mentioned, everyone is having a viral post there, right? So I do think that, like, to be honest, I think there will be a lot of players in the end, it will not be like one winner takes all, at least, I think for this video space, because video space is so huge, right?

S Speaker 122:27Okay, good point. So the other thing that we're spending some time on Ella is in this space, how does exit look like in this space, which is, is this space acquisitive? Yes. Then how many players can get acquired? Or does this space, can the space take, give birth to many IPOs, right? So this is where I also wanted to see what red point was thinking. Which is, how do they think this can exit?
Okay, good point. So the other thing that we're spending some time on Ella is in this space, how does exit look like in this space, which is, is this space acquisitive? Yes.

25:57Are there any big agencies that are public?
Are there any big agencies that are public?
Are there any big agencies that are public?
Are there any big agencies that are public?
S Speaker 226:01Hello, um, it's true. There is no agency that goes public. But the thing is, like, I think that is the problem is because that is human powered, like, when you have a human powered agency, the enterprise you can serve, yeah, I agree.
Hello, um, it's true. There is no agency that goes public. But the thing is, like, I think that is the problem is because that is human powered, like, when you have a human powered agency, the enterprise you can serve, yeah, I agree.

S Speaker 126:19Which is, yeah, I was thinking the same thing, which is, like, this is different from an agency, because this is less of a services model, but we are trying to that those that like that was another question that we were trying to figure out as well, which is, can there be multiple winners, and if they can be multiple winners, then how do they exit?
Which is, yeah, I was thinking the same thing, which is, like, this is different from an agency, because this is less of a services model, but we are trying to that those that like that was another question that we were trying to figure out as well, which is, can there be multiple winners, and if they can be multiple winners, then how do they exit?

S Speaker 226:45So, yeah, so, so I think like you can better to look at like, what's existing today, right? Like for the ads saying like. So what we see is there are many great company who is, you know, either doing the like app loving, or they are like, app fire, adjust, and they are like, what is that like? Lot of like, social listening, and a lot of companies like that, right? So the thing is, I will see for ads or for marketing, they always will be a little bit crowded. I will see the market there. But the thing is, the people who really have the data, I think that will, you know, like, grow larger than other competitors. But it's never a winner take all space, and it's more like, what, what I see there. It's not more like a giant, dominant space, right? Like, when you look at like, ads or things like that, it's not always like, oh, people go to Facebook or or people go to Google. It's more like, okay, like they always are some third party one, like app lobbying, and they get, no, I love things, and in the end, they may get acquired by Google. I think Google acquired one called like, I don't remember the name is more like, they put ads in different websites. It's something like, I don't remember that company's name, but Google acquired that company because what that company did before is they have the algorithm trying to get everyone's ads into, you know, tons of website in the world, and then they will charge the distribution fee or Something like that. Then that company get acquired. So what I see is that, I think in this space, because it's a so large, you know, market, there will be different ways people will tackle it, and in the end, I will see, you know, like either I've seen those happening as it will be acquired by the brands, but they will be, you know, different verticals. So every, every vertical will have some, you know, winning company there interesting.
So, yeah, so, so I think like you can better to look at like, what's existing today, right? Like for the ads saying like. So what we see is there are many great company who is, you know, either doing the like app loving, or they are like, app fire, adjust, and they are like, what is that like?
