S Speaker 11:03yeah, yeah, well, again, I'm saying you probably on the way to producing so I'm very respectful for what you're doing. Because even Miko doing the geometric people in total our data set right so I see the potential work. I'm already trying to say from the interview problems, you may like to see a little more concrete measure. This is the one I'm asking for, in a sense.

1:28Yeah, I think trying to make sure I understand, Colin,

S Speaker 21:30when he says, Well, I was just thinking like, this was theoretical, and then the team did build the first version of this functional model that really proved out the theorems, specifically and concretely. You know, that that is step one and making this a reality. And then step two is now bringing the 3d world so I think this isn't just a just theoretical at this point. This is you know, been proven out to a very basic first step but like this is that's that's more than just, we think it will work. That's it. It is working.

S Speaker 32:08Yeah, yeah. I think maybe it was just trying to understand if your question was more about what real world applications are unlocked by something like this versus like, you know, concrete evidence on the technical side that it has obtained? I just I didn't think yeah, maybe it wasn't clear on what you're asking

S Speaker 22:23like concrete real world stuff we could be doing I think Christians just thinking between these two things. So like, we could go down

S Speaker 12:33some of the work if people doing the vision foundational model today and they will take on a more closer to the real world scenario kind of data set and try to construct a model to demonstrate the utility. What I'm saying I like to see a bit of that make sense? Yeah.

S Speaker 22:59just formed the company. Yeah, two months ago, this based off of this last work. Now we've got a team of seven working on this that's bringing it into a 3d world and a Christian that's like, I don't know if you want it is real world based, as well as some of the existing datasets. Yeah.

S Speaker 33:17So this is a nice progression of data sets, the movie data set, which sort of goes through like A through F, increasing complexity of sort of objects in scenes and then sort of camera blur and all these other artifacts, you encounter a quote artifact, encountering the world, you know, what happens when you encounter the world. So that's the that's sort of the series of benchmarks on which we're comparing all of our models for those kinds of problems and comparing to for example, state of the art methods in slot attention to these other skills

S Speaker 44:08Thanks. Thanks, Colin. Gretchen, really appreciate this. Great discussion. Keep me posted. I know. So you're extending the timeline, whether we keep me posted on that and then I'll follow up with next steps as well.

S Speaker 44:33when this works is also smaller faster. Yes.
S Speaker 44:41how small how fast, cheap and so but but that's definitely a big benefit if you weren't able to do just Sora but much cheaper then it's also beneficial. Yeah, exactly. How about if you can run another mobile phone? Yeah, right. Yes.
