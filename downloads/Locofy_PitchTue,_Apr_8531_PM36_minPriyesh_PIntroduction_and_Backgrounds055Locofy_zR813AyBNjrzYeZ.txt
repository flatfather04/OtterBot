S Speaker 22:20I'm originally from. I'm originally from India. Did my undergrad in India, worked a couple of years there, and worked for a clean tech startup saw it grew from series A to they will be filing an IPO this year. That was a great experience. And then I moved to us about three years back. I've been in venture for the last two and a half years. Worked with Morpheus ventures in LA for a year, and then had a small stint with Menlo Ventures in Bay Area, and then currently and senior associate with Qualcomm ventures for over a year or so, and then particularly looking at AI investments for the team, got

S Speaker 19:32quick intro would be, would be nice to kind of see this like, at least on a high level. It matches like, you know, I'm obviously keen to know how the fund operates. You know, how many people they are, there are, what kind of companies you invest in, what stages positions you take, and then we can take it together. Got

S Speaker 112:01I guess I would ask. I think I like some of the names you've mentioned, hugging, face, anthropic, scary. I respect all these companies. That's great to know. With these companies. Did you come in at a later stage, or was it also at Series A? These were

S Speaker 217:11Just, I would say, operate on a premium model, because we don't. We are not sure if the traction that they have today, which is amazing to like, amazing at the least, but I we're not sure if that would stay. We we see in the market that, I

S Speaker 117:26think a lot of respect for lovable board, but the story in the market right now is all monthly times 12, and it's increasing because it's a hype stage right now. We've seen that, by the way, when we were in free beta, we had that stage where it all goes and everyone wants to use it, and then all of a sudden you realize you attract all kinds of people. And lovable and bold are attracting investors. They're attracting ex founders, non tech founders, growth people, operations people, everyone's building something and saying, I built 10 apps in the last three days, but none of those apps are going to be used. And the interesting thing is this, that these guys will be a means to an end. You build something, most of them are just going to be like, Okay, I'm done with it. No need to build more. And the ones that are serious about building will actually go and raise so you will see news of like, hey, lovable built app was just funded, but the moment they are funded, lovable stops scaling. We want to find engineers and build it from scratch, and that's where it actually increases our market, if anything. So they haven't gone through the churn cycles yet with you. We actually did annual deals straight away. We made a very bold decision that we'll only do annual deals, because front end is not something you do on a daily basis. And rather than you have a three month period where you're using the profile like crazy, and then month four and five, you churn, and then we have we then our focus goes towards how do we bring this customer back? We will only do annual deals, rather than worrying about churn, because front end is not a day to day. It's not like a chat app, right? Like you do it three months and then you launch two months later, and then you're like, Okay, now I have a next project, and then you start working on the next project. So we have done annual deals, and that way we can stay focused. And we also know that, because these are enterprises that took us a few months to get into, I mean, the enterprise process is like crazy, but because we have things like on premise deployment, private cloud deployments, where security and compliance is not a concern. And because of the pain that it takes to get into these enterprises, we know once we are in, we are in for a while, unless we like, screw up really, really bad somewhere we don't have to worry about if we can live with very acceptable churn figures, and that's what has been the biggest learning for us, that enterprises. A year ago, I didn't think we will have a salesperson. Yeah, we will have an enterprise. If we have one or two enterprise deals good, we'll learn something from it. Today, we are 90% enterprise, and that's why Anu was hired six months ago, and our deal sizes are like I started with Infosys at $10,000 I'm not a sales guy, by the way. So if I could sell for 10,000 my thesis was a proper sales person would come in and take it to the next level. So I hired Anu, and now Infosys, six months later, is already at $250,000 and we are discussing a million and a half. Yeah, deal with them, because now that CTO is like, hey, six, six of my teams are already using Bucha fire, and we're like, hey, yeah. I mean, all your teams can use it, and it's not too far from I mean, the 10,000 to 1 million sounds like a jump, but 250, K to like a potentially a million dollar negotiated deal is not that crazy, especially when you have teams internally saying it works. Bucha, for example, it's an insurance company. They are paying a scary $1,000 for just the Saudi Arabia team, and now they're talking to, hey, this is great. We will introduce you to our other Bucha teams. Deloitte us is 170k deal for just the internal tools team, and we know we can expand that in the next six to nine months. So we know that we're not selling something where an average contract value is 10, 15k Yes, we have customers at 5k to 15k range as well, smaller agencies that obviously can't afford more. But up pricing is such that we sell tokens so we can cater to every customer, and the customers who really like us and they understand the token usage can then always go for a higher tier, where the token price drops significantly.
think a lot of respect for lovable board, but the story in the market right now is all monthly times 12, and it's increasing because it's a hype stage right now. We've seen that, by the way, when we were in free beta, we had that stage where it all goes and everyone wants to use it, and then all of a sudden you realize you attract all kinds of people.

S Speaker 221:14That makes sense. That makes sense. So, yeah, just to wrap up your previous question, I think, I don't think in the prompt to code space we would be investing anywhere, but we are looking at parallel spaces. So we have had an investment in and generative AI native office suit. It's a stealth company right now we're looking at 3d creation tools. So companies which could do can what Canva did to 2d design to 3d design. So those are spaces we are looking at some companies which are generating AI native agents for support engineers and things like that. So that's entirely different engineering space. And then in DevOps, I guess we are more excited about the coding ecosystem, rather than just code generation. So that's a couple of spaces, but I don't see a clear competitor of locofi in our portfolio or in our pipeline right now. I
That makes sense. That makes sense.

So those are spaces we are looking at some companies which are generating AI native agents for support engineers and things like that. So that's entirely different engineering space. And then in DevOps, I guess we are more excited about the coding ecosystem, rather than just code generation. So that's a couple of spaces, but I don't see a clear competitor of locofi in our portfolio or in our pipeline right now. I

S Speaker 122:12of competitors we have. One is an Israel company called anima. If you're doing research like, I highly encourage investors and customers to cry out our competitors as well, because when we started local fire in 2021 anima had been around for five years, and we were like, Why should we build this company if someone already is doing it? Obviously, very first question. We looked at the product, then we looked at the team, and we knew why the product was not good, so we took our chances with them. Over the period of last three to five years, about nine competitors have come, made claims and fallen. We knew it will ultimately come down to the team. Then we have builder.io which has recently started doing design to code as well. But I think their strategy is just so cluttered, where we do CMS, we do no code, we also have a design tool, we also have design to code where, yes, it is a distraction, and our customers do assess us against them, but we are a completely different company because they are very much I think their strategy isn't clear and B, even if it is, the way they do design record is very different from ours. They're looking at L and Ms. They're looking at getting people off figma, which is not our intention. Our intention is keep the designers in their tools they love and the stack they love and the IDE they love, and play the role of a bridge in solving a problem that no one else is solving, and it's a difficult one to solve. So our space is very clear, up to 1,000,000,002 billion, we want to be very much front end automation, front end acceleration. Yes, of course, at that stage, we could be potentially considering looking at, should we bring our own design tool, yeah. Like, if we, if you can already understand, if you build our own proprietary models and understand design and convert them into amazing code representations and get the same output back, we have everything we need to build a design tool. But does the world need another design tool right now? That's the question. How is it going to be different? Or the other thing is, every partner with the likes of the codiums and the cursors, and we know how it pans out without having to invest billions into that. We get to see how it pans out, and then we could potentially build compiler capacity. So today, we convert designs to code, and we say, here's a code. You can improve it, but you can't add logic to it, take it to cursor, but we can make it into a full blown builder, which again, fits in into VS code and GitHub. So we don't take, we don't want to make that bet of getting people off these tools that are tried and tested. That's our strategy,

S Speaker 224:43right? And you have a big, big pie of value to still acquire. So that makes a lot of sense, Honey, can you tell me a little bit more about the proprietary model that you have, you mentioned, it's not LLM based. Is it a VLM? What's the architecture you're using the Android and how have you trained it?
right? And you have a big, big pie of value to still acquire.

What's the architecture you're using the Android and how have you trained it?
S Speaker 124:59Yeah. So look, the name makes it sound like it will be similar to llms, but it's completely opposite, right? So what goes into converting designs to code, essentially, is a bunch of things, right? Number one, the designs have to be optimized, which means the design structure matters, right? Like, if, I don't know if you've played around with a design tool in the past, but you look at a very beautiful website and think that is a design, it is, but figma is representation is layers, right? So frame one has a children and has a child and has properties. That's what we call figma load metadata, right? So we take all the figma load metadata and we say, hey, the same design has to be structured better in order to give better results. So we have one model that is to do with graph, neural networks and XD graph and solo, YOLO, sorry, which basically understands the relationship of parent and child. So if there's a button and an input, sorry, a button and an icon and a text, the outer frame is the parent and the inner to our children? Or is there a relationship between so one one model looks at grouping layers, the other model then looks at finding these different UI elements, like a rectangle with an icon or a text can be both a button and input, a date, time picker and other things, accordions as well. Yeah, so one model is more based on multimodal, but it's mostly visuals based, which says we've trained it and said, This is a button, this is an input. Let's figure that out so that the user doesn't have to write the code, and let's make the right prediction. The third one then finds the library. It could come from a material UI library. It could come from hand design. It could come from react, native paper. There's like hundreds of these public libraries that say, design it in a certain way. So your button, one button, can come from 100 different libraries. We predict which library it comes from, and import the related assets and write the right code semantically write code. So that's what we call it, which is more to do with visual, multimodal text and surrounding information around it. Another one is similarity detection modeling, which is to find components and props. So let's say, if you do a Airbnb website and showing you all your possible options right when you search for a property, it will show you 15 or six. Now, a bad engineer who writes 1800 lines of code for each of those segments, a good engineer will write 100 lines of code and say, This is a repeating component. It just has a different image, different name, different text, different rating, where I need to write code once for this component, and everything else which is dynamic becomes a prop. So our model goes in and looks at these repeating elements through similarity, collection models, and then breaks into components and props. Another one looks at responsiveness and layout this website. How does it work? On the wire, on tablet, landscape, so that one is based more on our own proprietary model that we built for media queries itself, then we have one for layer detection and layer naming. So a search button, whichever e commerce website design in code you don't want to see the search button. So with the right context, that's the only place where we use elements. We partnered with Gemini with our accelerator, if you pass in the right context, then in the code, it will be called Search button, not frame one, right? And then all of this goes into a code generator, which is not based on any AI model, because we want, if you come back 15 times, you should get the same code for the same design. So that is purely heuristic space. Also the code generation happens on the fly, so your code will never hit our servers, right? So our server module, JSON file, our AI decisions on top, and then on the browser, we generate the code on the fly, so that from a security point of view, security point of view, we don't even have access to your code, and it's faster as well. We actually do a research paper, launching a research paper, which, if your team, you can go to a website and read the reason why we are writing a research paper, not that we are research organization, is to bring at the next stage. We want to bring the best researchers in this field. My wife, herself does. She's a neuroscientist, so she looks at brain MRI scans, and it's very much similar. It's not looking at design support, but she's looking at brain MRIs and trying to figure out the chances of early dementia. So we've partnered with her, but we think we want to bring in more and more people from design field who went into ml and also from research field who understand visuals more than anyone else, and create like a good mix, in order to be seen as not just a design to code company, but also attract the best of the best researchers, the best trend engineers, the best designers and the best researchers working together, is the future of solving this problem that's very interesting,
Yeah. So look, the name makes it sound like it will be similar to llms, but it's completely opposite, right? So what goes into converting designs to code, essentially, is a bunch of things, right?

S Speaker 129:16could still work. It took us eight months to launch for our first version of figma. Three years we're launching, which I believe I mentioned, is a open source design tool. The likes of Google, Facebook, you know, these really large organizations, they prefer a design tool that can be launched on premise. So open source is becoming very, very popular, and we've been we know these designs look the figma, a huge company. We launched this one company, right? And we built, over time, we built a partnership. Ideally, we want to be as close to as possible in the likes of penpot. We're launching our solution next month. It is taking us five weeks to build a new design to integration. Miro acquired a company called UIs. Their founder is trying to be popular for the longest time. He is talking to us later tonight on, how can we if you think about it, Miro is about wire framing and Solutioning. And then they bought design too, and now they're saying, hey, we want to also let people build the front end, right? But they don't know anything about how to go from design to code, which is very common, and say, you can do your API, and say, whatever, right? So you're absolutely right. We do depend on figma, or we have depended on figma in the past, but with our current roadmap, we are removing the dependency, and also, if figma would build its own. It's been the biggest question to us since the day we started first we asked ourselves, and everyone who has talked to us has asked us, What if figma builds its own? They can just like Google could have built and Google finder, they could have figma is a very, very talented company. They have basically taken the designer to the next level because they're obsessed about designs. The front end code is not in not designed. If it was that easy for a design tool to launch the coding platform then become COVID and VS code would have launched a design tool a long time. It says it'll work like that. They're catering to a very different audience. Designers and engineers are very different the way they work the tools, and it is very, very different. So they can win it, but the more they build it, the better for me, because it tells the other design tools that you can't just sit on the backward anymore. And that's why they look at solutions like us, and that's why we had acquisition offers last year, right? So we decided to take that competition with Sigma optimal. Their frenemies, right? We're partners, but there's always this looming threat from whether they want something. I have met the team members and London, this problem is the only problem we are solving.

We have a team of people who
S Speaker 231:10are front end. We will take that on. Yeah, that's absolutely and understand that. I know we are over time. So a very quick question, and I'll end there. So the GD motion sales led, you said 90% of the revenue is coming from on prices. What revenue period are you targeting to

S Speaker 131:24provide 520 25 without fundraise would be 3 million. By the way, we don't go with ambitious targets, just to seem like we made a projection last year that by the end of q1 we will be at 700k and by the end of q2 we'll be at 1.2 million. We're already meeting there. Yeah, right. So our goal is 3 million by the end of the year, but I won't be surprised if you cross four without any external capital coming in. We have six runway, and that runway is getting extended as we go but in the event of potentially doing either series A or a small round, because we are also thinking, Do we are also thinking, Do we really need 15 million, 20 million right now, or can we just raise a smaller, $5 million quick round, which doesn't distract us? We think, by raising four, 5 million, we take the company to a 20, 30 million Arr, by next year, and then potentially better to then do a price round. So there are two options we're considering, and there's always a third option, which is, if your property will just grow property, which I think has been a pipe break for many, many founders, for me, coming from a slightly like I want to make profits. I want infinite runway so I can be like I did what I had to do now as possible. And I want to raise money, not because I depend on it, because we really can go fast. So maybe we have the team. We have momentum, everything going for us to get there. We've done a million ARR with just one sales person, but yeah, at the same time, we feel that they're already right. Now, the biggest problem we have is 6:30am to 11pm calls, customer calls. We've hired a second sales person. Should be just like, similar to what codium did. They actually hired a salesman. If it's already working for us, with just one marketer doing half a day of work per week, spending 3k a week basically, that's quite optic, not when the demand is so crazy that all we have to do is close deals. And if that's the case, should I just get in more sales people? How do I if I get more sales people? Do I need to get more solution architects? How does that impact that roadmap? My attention, that's where we are thinking, potentially having another round with our existing investors. Let me just do a smaller one, quick one. I don't care about building a company that is great and profitable and is there like 1015, years from now as well. That's where it's possible that we could raise in the year higher. But the real benefits of raising money would be next year, because we think organically, take it to 16 to 17 projected billionaire. But with fundraiser,
provide 520 25 without fundraise would be 3 million. By the way, we don't go with ambitious targets, just to seem like we made a projection last year that by the end of q1 we will be at 700k and by the end of q2 we'll be at 1.2 million.

S Speaker 133:49for us to start with as well. Actually, because there are investors three, four years under. Than Excel, the decision to invest should be, or the decision to take the investment should be such a natural one, where we say, look, we've done all together. It worked really well. You guys supported us. Let's do it. That's what we believe as well. That's why, by the way, they know we save those raising seven and a half because it's like, I'm not going to bring a board member just because people say good things about things about him. I want to see them in action and build that relationship. So we are always very, very welcoming for investors who say, Let's try something like either one of our portfolio companies or either our company itself. We want to see our ability to sell. We want to see how our teams respond to it. We want to see how well you can sell and regain and then maybe we just do an investment. So that part I love, I will put you talking a thread with alumni, and you sales, like, even if you can float it in front of, like, two or three enterprises, including your own, I think there is no doubt in our mind that it is solving a real problem. And we will please get that first call. And after that first call, we don't want to, yeah, sounds good.
