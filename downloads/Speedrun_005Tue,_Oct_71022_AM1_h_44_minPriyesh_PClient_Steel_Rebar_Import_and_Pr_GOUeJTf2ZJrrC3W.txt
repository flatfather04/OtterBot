S Speaker 10:03In just a little bit about this program we're two years in. In the last cycle for speed run five we had 14,000 companies apply. Our team reviewed every single one of those applications, believe it or not, and we selected hundreds of the best ones to interview, and ultimately brought together this wonderful batch that you're going to be today of less than 1% the best of the best. And we've been working with them for the past few months. They've been actually working out of our offices. They've full access to the team. It's very exciting, and again, very excited to introduce you. It's a very big day for our founders. Much of them are waiting backstage to meet all of you. Let's give them a big hand.

S Speaker 41:59Everyone, what an honor to go after these legends. My name is Philip. I'm the co founder and CEO of Nexa. We build specialized AI for industrial engineering and heavy industries. Think of rail, construction, energy. Our world runs on heavy industries and their importance accelerating faster than ever before. For decades, this market has been misunderstood anything like that by software companies. Millions of industrial engineers work in environments that look like this. Those days are over. We're taking this environment into the AI native era, and we're pretty damn successful with it. Over the past nine months, we've grown from zero to $980,000 in contracted revenue. We have some of the biggest companies in our pipeline. We have companies in auto manufacturing, construction and rail as our customers, and we're finalizing our first seven figure, multi year enterprise deal as we speak, we're taking industrial engineering into a new era, and Nexa is becoming an industrial standard. Our AI engineers deploy specialized systems into the complex environments of our customers. Once deployed next, it becomes the tool of choice for the industrial engineers. They don't interface with their own tools anymore. Our AI systems do, and we're already saving hundreds of hours of engineering time every single week taking on heavy industries requires the perfect team, and we have the exceptional founder. Market Fit. Growing up in Germany, I spent over 10 years in those industries, selling hundreds of millions of dollars of rail system and managing construction projects. My co founder, David is the perfect addition to me and my industry experience. He grew up in Silicon Valley. He spent his entire life in software engineering with a focus on specialized systems and complex environments. Today is just the beginning. We're building a foundation for artificial super intelligence and heavy industries. Think of Nexa as the cursor for industrial engineering in the future, we're not doing this in the lab, but in the real world, with real customers. From day one, today is my birthday. This is the best birthday.

S Speaker 64:32Hi, I'm Elena, co founder and CEO of tie, and together with my co founder, Amy, we're building AI, you'll actually work where we're ex Apple engineers and Stanford product design grads. I've worked on antenna integration and speakers for Apple's thinnest product ever, the iPad Pro. And Amy worked on novel materials and accessories for iPhone and iPad cases that have won petas design from the euros. The problem is simple. This is what AI wearables look like today. They're obtrusive, over engineered, and look like gadgets that nobody wants to wear, which is why no product has cracked seamless AI voice for everyday life. Taya is different. It's a necklace that becomes your living memory. With a tap, you can capture a thought, conversation, a walk, a song, and in the end, Taya turns it into a multimedia timeline of your life, reflections linked with maps, photos and context over time, Taya remembers your patterns and becomes your contextual intelligence. This is more than a wearable, it's a new category of computing that's private jewelry first and socially acceptable. The mo isn't just hardware. It's the software that organizes the human experience into something personal, searchable and enduring. We know what it takes to go from prototype to product at Apple scale and for design, we've partnered with former Chief of design at Nokia and creator of the best selling cone of all time. We launched last week, and our video blew up and went viral with over 3 million views across platforms. We sold over 200 units on our first day with no ads. That's one title sold every four minutes. Our vision is clear. We're redefining what it means to carry intelligence with you, building the foundation for the next era of AI, one that lives with you and not on a screen. Thank you. You

S Speaker 912:01everyone, we're anko, and we're building the AI agent workforce for food distribution, and we've done 850k in contracted Arr, in just 10 weeks. Let's talk about it. When was the last time that you actually stopped to think about where your food comes from between that juicy piece of sushi and a fisherman hundreds of miles away, is the backbone of America's food supply chain, the food distribution responsible for sourcing and delivering 99% of the food that each of You eat. But the problem is this $350 billion industry. Is held up by anyone stacks of people, 30 year old ERPs and people screaming at each other on the phone. It's like Wall Street in the 90s, except it smells like fish. Guys. Hey, everyone. I'm Za and I was supposed to be doing a PhD in metaphysics and 4d space time, but I slipped and fell into McKinsey, where I ended up designing products used by 10s of millions and oversaw the largest ever rollout of AI and food services, the largest ever. And my co founder and best friend, smayan, was one of the first engineers to build a generative AI, working directly under Logan Kilpatrick before getting snatched up to go and build the world's largest AI enabled data collaboration network. It's no wonder I call it my artificial Indian and Together, we're building anchor the first end to end AI operating system specifically for food distributors. And guess what? It's already almost doubling margins. You've had a lot of buzzwords guys, but simply we solve two problems, wasted hours and bad decisions, and we do it with one agent ecosystem that integrates with systems of record and communication channels to eliminate the manual, repetitive, tedious workflows that are bothering our food distributor friends. We've solved the messy inbox and communication channel problem eating into half of a sales rep's day. We've automated procurement in real time, and we're generating next gen insights and proactively acting upon them from across disparate data silos. As I said, we've done 850k in contracted ARR in just 10 weeks, and seen a staggering 20x growth in daily usage on our platform. That, ladies and gentlemen, is the speedrun effect. We've also had a seven figure pipeline, including publicly traded distributors. That number doubled on Monday, and we closed that publicly traded distributor on Thursday, everyone. I'm gonna leave you on this note, and it's really important, the food that you eat matters, the people out there making it possible every day they matter. Building for the backbone of America's food supply chain. That matters. We're echo, and we're just getting started. You

As I said, we've done 850k in contracted ARR in just 10 weeks, and seen a staggering 20x growth in daily usage on our platform. That, ladies and gentlemen, is the speedrun effect. We've also had a seven figure pipeline, including publicly traded distributors. That number doubled on Monday, and we closed that publicly traded distributor on Thursday, everyone. I'm gonna leave you on this note, and it's really important, the food that you eat matters, the people out there making it possible every day they matter. Building for the backbone of America's food supply chain. That matters. We're echo, and we're just getting started. You
S Speaker 1015:17up. Dex is solving the biggest challenge that companies face today hiring. This year, more than $850 billion was spent on recruitment fees alone, and we're getting it so wrong. My name is Paddy. I'm the co founder and CEO of Dex. I spent more than a decade building talent at some of the world's greatest companies, like improbable and Europe's largest VC fund, Atomico. My co founder, Harry, built the data intelligence platform that atomica used to track talent and make investment decisions. Together, we've assembled a world class team dedicated to solving this problem. Recruitment, at its core is a human problem. Candidates and companies alike struggle to articulate the needs and wants to go beyond the CV and the job description, and it's leading to bad outcomes. 46% of new hires will fail or quit within 18 months. Dex closes the information gap at the heart of this problem. Don't listen to me. Hear it from him.

S Speaker 1116:13Hi, I'm Dex, an AI powered career matchmaker. I get to know candidates beyond their CV and dig into their ambitions, preferences and values. Every day, I scour the market, surfacing the most exciting, hard to access roles, often before they are published, I work directly with hiring managers at World Class startups, hedge funds and tech companies, learning exactly what they need. When the two align, I make the match, and then I stay involved guide candidates through each stage of the hiring process and keep employers and candidates updated so nothing stalls. I turn conversations into careers and headcount into high performers.

This is currently kind of how the designer developer handle looks like. I know it's still kind of broken and disconnected, but we're going to fix that. So with pencil, you know, we're all becoming makers. Our roles are merging, but tooling has stayed behind. Few months ago, I was quoting a cursor, and I realized it's painfully hard to describe user interface to an LLM with just words, so I built a bridge five for Canvas, living inside of cursor. I put it out, and it went viral. It got over 1 million views. And as of last week, we have actual launch, and we've got viral again. You've got 1000s of comments and sign ups from people at companies like Microsoft, Uber and Shopify, essentially begging for it. So what is pencil? It's a super fast vegel canvas that lists right inside your favorite coding IDE, basically you mentioned figma inside first. Or you can manually design something, and AI can take over, or AI can design things for you. It can also design in parallel, at multiple places on the canvas, while you're working on some area here, it can design there. So design now lives fully in your code base, where all the agents are. They can access your designs. They can work with them, and they can also create them, you know. So obviously this completely removes the hand of them spoken about in the beginning, you know, because now you can take these designs and fully generate designs. Sorry, fully generate code with them. So the code is fully intertwined. This is the pixel perfect context that I have originally imagined. So why us? We're a stellar team of nine people. We have three VC backed exits on our belt. I've spent almost a decade at adobe building design tools and also talking at design conferences around the world. I know everything you can imagine about design. Then I went on to build two companies, one got acquired by Google and the unwanted Miro. So Anton Priyesh, we're building pencil we want to give every engineer and AI designer and worshiping in November. Thank you very much. You

This is a video of our drone responding to the scene of an active structure fire with nothing but a prompt investigate the column of smoke. Now this is the only new system in the world right now that can do this without a human pilot at dispatcher. We've created the software to turn any drone into an agent capable of capable of making real time decisions. So we quit our jobs in June, and in just three months, we signed pilot contracts worth over $50,000 per drug site to protect our data centers and defend our schools. We see strong traction across our partners in private security, defense and agriculture, and this is team to do. I've been building drugs since I was 12, and in college, I was picked up as the founding engineer at a YC company. If you call 911, there's a good chance that one of my drugs would show up before first responders. Since then, I've worked at both Tesla and SpaceX as for my co founder, Nick so they could use a little bit of work. But in college, he was a nationally ranked power lifter, went on to become a navy fit fighter pilot, and then went on to Harvard Business School with an AI meta counter drone systems at annual and deep search at x ai. So why quit our jobs? Why now? Because right now, drones are decided outcomes for people that we know, from soldiers that make back Ukraine to my family living in Taiwan. Because right now, AI has finally come to science fiction, to where we can use it to defend ourselves and rebuild our economy. But these AI, these language models, these transformers, they were invented all the way back in 2016 It wasn't until the chat interface was a sign that people started realizing possibilities at dispatcher. We're building the agentic interface for drills and robotics so we can create that same chat GPT moment, but for the physical world. Thank you. You

S Speaker 1733:33there. I'm Bruce Johnson. I'm co founder and CEO of loanmaps. We're building AI workers for mortgage companies. So if you've ever taken on the mortgage and been annoyed when your lender asked for the same documents over and over again, well you've experienced a symptom of a chronic disease that is pervasive throughout Mortgage Finance. I understand this disease and what causes it, because my last company was a real estate debt marketplace named pure Street. I grew that business over 100 million in annual revenue. We process nearly 50,000 loans, and I raised $150 million from some of the world's best investors, like Andreessen Horowitz. Yet even though we invested most of that money in the cutting edge technology at the time, the average loan that came to our platform still required humans to perform more than 500 manual soul sucking tasks. So we're here on a mission to liberate humans from having to perform that soul second work. So to do this, I partnered with a Stanford and Mediterranean AI researcher, and Kevin and I have recruited my best engineers from peer Street who have deep industry expertise. Our first product is an agentic loan processing assistant named Lois who automates the onboarding and assembly of long files. When a borrower submits information, Lois gathers that information, she reviews the information, she organizes it, and she highlights issues to salespeople and underwriters so they can focus on closing more business much faster with much lower risk. We've been building Lois in stealth alongside some great customers, and we've got a huge pipeline of high quality relationships from my time at peer Street to sell into when we launch later this month. Now we're starting a loan file assembly because it is incredibly painful for humans to do, and it's ubiquitous problem across the industry. But more importantly, the loan file is the atomic unit of every workflow associated with a mortgage. So once we own that that loan file, we'll move on to underwriting, closing finance all the way through capital markets. So the future of mortgage finance will be aI native, and we're going to create that future. So if you'd like to hear more about it, come see us or shoot me an email. The name is brew like a beer@lowlands.ai Thank you.

We make voice first, AI apps for wellness launched our first app six weeks ago, and today, we're on a $1.6 million run rate. It did this in weeks, not months. We move fast because we spent many years in the toughest consumer vertical gaming. I'm a lifelong founder and operator with multiple exits and ran ad polling at $500 million scale. Will my co founder was a very, very productive triple dot where I built two thirds of company revenue from scratch to $300 million a year. That's where we learned how to make and scale highly retentive consumer products and in wellness, the biggest problems in areas and retention, AI, voice and agents will 10x outcomes in the space. That's what we're building. The first app, voice is an emotional well being companion. That's the one we scaled to seven digits. And second half grade is a multi agent health coach. We took that from concept to MVP in three weeks, and the marketing metrics are even stronger in our voice build the tools and systems that allow us to test, launch and validate faster than anybody else. Adverse traps launched in six weeks. Seven digit runway is almost double 50. This chart is not tickled, queues, emails in a waitlist or un monetized EU. This is real subscription revenue. Mobile is our wedge into the massive health and wellness economy, and we will lead the way in consumer violence play out. If you want to hear more about how we can mix from here, please come talk to us. Thank you.

S Speaker 744:23Hey guys, amanche, co founder and CEO of Vince, and we're on a mission to make online shopping actually fun. So the current state of online shopping is, quite frankly, so boring and none of the existing marketplaces can keep up with the dopamine fueled experiences that capitalize or that captivate younger audiences today, but that's about to change. Leap bins, a new way to shop online that breaks down all the walls of existing marketplaces through a game of Priyesh approach, we provide users a daily dose of online shopping, almost like a gotcha game by putting exploration first. We hit the App Store 10 days ago, and our early adoption has been super exciting. Our user base consists of about 1000 power sellers right now, and even before onboarding buyers at scale, the supply has become the demand. We're seeing a d1 retention averaging around 75% and we've already processed it to build over 100 orders on platform. My co founder and I have been friends since we're 13 years old. I just graduated for Priyesh this year, and my heart lies in creating consumer experiences. I previously deployed and created a web app that reached over 3 million unique users in a month without spending a cent on marketing. And when I was in school, Nathan was making moves in the real world. He was the sole developer at a tax and accounting startup scale from zero to over a million MRR, before leading to consumer projects, and now we're joined by some of the most talented engineers and designers from some of the world's most retentive platforms. But most importantly, Nathan and I have been hitting the grips together for years, and we're deeply immersed in the community and in the creative shopping space. Community is everything so existing communities that are built around yesterday's marketplaces all acknowledge that the old sites have grown stale, and the most recurring feedback we get from our users is that they're so excited to finally move off of Depop and Poshmark for good. The timing is right. Our users are ready, so we hope you hop on board and upgrade your closets along the way. Thanks. You. Priyesh,

S Speaker 1446:36hi everyone. My name is Johan Diaz. I'm the CEO of Ursa mining, and we're on a mission to build the world's first fully autonomous mine. Despite mining's importance, over half of our still domestic mine labor is set to retire over the next several years, and there isn't enough inbound talent to replace it. Meanwhile, demand for metal is skyrocketing, and mines can't scale production fast enough. They know that autonomy is their only option, and they're looking for ways to implement it right now. That's why, at ourselves, we're building exactly what they're looking for, autonomous AI operators that can control any piece of equipment that a mine already has. All we need to do is attach our hardware kits. Once attached, our AI system tells the equipment what to do exactly like a mine would. We're currently deep in R and D, with the excavator, with plans to expand, to automate front loaders, bulldozers and haul trucks.

We watched about eight weeks ago, and we've been doubling nearly every single week since then, hitting about 65,000 users, and with best in class retention, it's also unlocked a B to B motion after seeing congregants use our app, several churches reached out asking for a white paper. We see this as a wedge into the 100 and $50 billion church software and donation ecosystem, a market that's dominated by legacy companies, largely ignored by tech.

Our customers have tried existing tools, but they don't work for them. For example, current slide making tools are for the general audience to one shot simple presentations, but consultants spend most of their time iterating on dense, complex slides. That's why press A integrates seamlessly with existing workflows and already saves 50% of slide making time today, consultancies hire smart people for grunt work. That's why we're automating $1 trillion of consulting work. We're starting with slides. We will expand into AI native task management, then Client Management.

S Speaker 261:02:21begins in the most important amazing town on Earth, Westport. That's because that's where hondro Benny and I went upon researchers at Bridgewater. Benny was the lead research engineer responsible for bridgewater's Asian strategies, the largest hedge fund deployed in China. And hondro and I were responsible for our equity systems, which traded $3 billion every month, the lifeblood of every hedge fund and every trading firm is finding new ideas, new signals, new trades from new sources of data, finding even one predictive data set can generate a hedge fund hundreds of millions of dollars in expected returns. So you would think that a fund like Bridgewater, we would be doing everything and anything possible to trial every data set and attribute that is not what we found. What we found is, on average, data trials take months, cost the firm millions, and are mostly composed of manual, repetitive work. That is why we left and that is why we're building oleum. Oleum is an AI data expert for every data set that we then deploy to every data client on prem or on a PC, a process that once took months, will now take days, and all of the repetitive work of data processing will now be done instantly. Now I love our lawyers, but the last week, my lawyers have not loved me, and that's why they have said that, because of the MBAs that we have signed, we cannot reveal the actual identity or initial customers. But what I can't tell you is this, our very first pilot will be with the largest consumer of data and finance. And the data spend of our pipeline is one of $3 billion but we have not built a hedge fund product, and we have not built a product for finance. We have built a data layer for all data science workflows and all enterprises. That is why our pipeline includes fortune five, hundreds, healthcare companies, advertisers, insurance companies and more. And if you're curious to hear more, please come talk to us. You

S Speaker 281:06:32everyone. I'm here CEO at agent Astra, and we're building the next generation AI ups in logistics. Every shipment creates a mountain of paperwork, Bill ratings, packing list, commercial invoices and many more. In fact, back office staff and his company spent about an hour per shipment just processing documents with our AI agent. That jumps to just a couple of minutes across partners. We've actually automated about 60% of document and compliance workflows. And one design partner actually grew revenue by 25% another grew volume by 20% because they could finally focus on customers instead of paperwork. But documentation is really only the tip of the iceberg. 90% of the staff and these companies focus on competitive back office work, hooking cargo, matching customs, tracking shipments, you name it. And as AI software vendors, we have created efficiencies, but it's actually the operator that captured most of the venture. And so that's where we're not stopping at building software. We are building a full stack AI power logistics operator, and to capture all the value, our strategy is to acquire those operators and apply cleanly. That's the fastest way to capture relationships, data, revenue, and it's where the defensive ability lands. We currently have free analyze out to acquire companies, logistics providers, and we have a creative deal structure that basically enables us to pull up these acquisitions without raising any equity. Our team has done it before. My co founder Rue previously that rolled up from inception all the way to a billion dollar IPO and our CTO Artur was head of platform at a company that raised over a billion dollars where he oversold the UPS rollout. I myself spent 12 years in logistics and tech and Priyesh scale a venture backed company from zero to $18 million of ARR in under two years. We're basically the Backstreet Boys and logistics, and we're building hm Astra, the next generation AI UPS take care.

Healthcare Administration runs on insurance policies at every interaction, someone's deciphering hundreds of complex documents by hand over and over again, and everyone loses it's bad for insurance companies. It's bad for providers, and it's definitely bad for patients. To solve this we spun out of the Stanford Research Lab and formed logical health. I'm Lauren Bilbo co founder and CEO. I'm a health insurance broker Stanford MBA and a former Google engineering manager. My co founder is an AI and security tech lead from Google embedded, and we're supported by world class industry and scientific leaders, including the former CEO of Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina, our unique insight is to ground AI with math proofs to produce fast and precise insurance cover answers. We've built a proprietary AI system that converts insurance policies into math, and this forms the rules engine for our coverage answers. We prove this works in the real world. When this approach saved one of the largest insurers $16 million a year. We're now working on our first three paid pilots. Our wedge is customer service at health insurance companies, we built real time call decision supportly, but for health care call centers Next, we'll bring the same high precision coverage answers to prior authorization, claims processing and design. There's a $500 billion industry waiting to be disrupted, and we're a top team with an industry proven solution. Please join us in bringing transparency to health insurance. Thank

S Speaker 181:16:22you. Hello, everyone. Good afternoon. We are prep and we are modernizing global education. That's right, education, let's first talk about the why. Frankly, llms have changed the game. When you look at chatgpt A large portion of their process tokens, over the past few months have been from students in school. AI has clearly disrupted the way we see global education, and schools have yet to adapt. Why? Because they care about two things, reliability and flexibility, two factors that are so hard to find in the current ed tech market. This is what we here at prep are going to build. We built the next generation AI Native education platform that offers AI as the co pilot for both students and teachers.

We are already cash flow positive, and are already expanding into the US, with talks underway with affiliates of Arizona State University and the University of Chicago, my friends, we are prep and we are modernizing global education. We would love to have you join us. Thank you.
