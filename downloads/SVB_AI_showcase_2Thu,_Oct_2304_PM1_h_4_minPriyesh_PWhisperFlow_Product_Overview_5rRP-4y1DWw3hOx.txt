S Speaker 10:00So I'm the CEO and co founder of wisperflow, a product that I see a lot of people here in the audience use, but for everybody else who does this, I'm going to spend the next five minutes diving into what it is and why a lot of organizations are adopting it across the board. So your average employee

S Speaker 10:38is just communication. This is in applications like Slack or you're writing docs, if external client comes it is even more so over the last couple of years, more and more prompts to AI systems, and what happens is, the more time we just spend diving, the less time we have for things that really matter. And so our goal as a company is to make interacting with your devices feel just as effortless as talking to a close credit. And on that, we build our first product whisper flow, which is voice detection that just feels effortless. Usually at this point, I go in and do a live demo, but I don't have a laptop with me right now, so I'll show you a quick video that I recorded for Y'all because C is believing. How

S Speaker 11:46With whisper flow, I can just speak about prompts. This is Tanya from whisper flow, and let me show you what makes whisper flow special. If you're up and running emails, you can use whisper to respond to them blazingly fast. Hey, sanaj, there's three things whisper does really well. It's insanely fast, it's insanely accurate, and it gets names right. Whispers, perfect. If you're often overwhelmed with the number of slack messages, hey, send me one minute, five, actually, 5:30pm and it drives not just what you said, but what you meant well, the latest feature snippets, you can use shortcuts for things you see often, like long prompts or calendar mailings. Whispering Chrome.

S Speaker 12:33for developers whisper seamlessly integrates with all your favorite IDEs. Hey? Can you look at all square TS constants of Ts and a TS, and fix the bugs across all of them, and also tags files and gets variable names right. We also build an iPhone app for people who do their best work on the go or while computing. It's actually a keyboard that lets you use it in any application. You just tap about it, speak, tap again, and Dev shows that perfectly formatted. And the best part is you can whisper extremely quietly. I'm gonna pull this mic very close to her mouth so you can see.

S Speaker 15:55That's even before the first telephone came out, and we actually have a chance today to change that and actually make history. So if you're excited to chat more, let's get you all flowing and my emails up here, so feel free to reach out to me afterwards, and let's get our whisper. Thank you

S Speaker 16:32Great question. So when you're writing with Whisper, whisper takes in the context of where you are, who you're talking to, in the surrounding context, and it uses that to format things properly. So what you'll see is, if you're writing in text messages, it's way more casual. If I was writing an email, it formats things like bullets, gets names right based on who I'm talking to. If I'm writing a document and say it's a legal document, it'll see things above and below. And will I got it legal document, I'm going to format it like this. And that is the magic that happens, where we go from what she said to what she would have written. And unlike every other voice dictation tool that just writes everything you say word for word, we don't do that.

S Speaker 17:18You know, we've seen people evolve their speech as they use whisper more and more. But the goal is, hey, you can jump in today. And like, I recommend, like, download the app, try it for yourself. Just speak naturally. And the key magic of whisper comes when it just writes what you would have expected it to write, taking care of all your mistakes and rambles and putting in the right structure

S Speaker 17:45Phenomenal question. So every other voice company, they measure this metric called Word accuracy, the percentage of words they get right. Siri is at 92 OpenAI is at 98 that metric sounds great, but it's actually terrible, because what that means is, in a 10 word sentence, it's going to make a mistake. The metric we measure is what we call zero edit rate, what percentage of the messages are sent without making a single change. So email comes in, you just press Enter for whisper, that is 85% so very rarely, if ever, are people editing things that they're saying and they just send it. The other message to measure is from the time you see the message on your screen to pressing send, what's the gap half a second on average. So most people don't even read what whisper writes after a few weeks of using it, because they've built the Trust for those who are rarely makes mistakes, if ever, and those are the metrics that matter to people.

S Speaker 19:14not supposed to transcribe meetings with it, but a lot of people use it for that so you can and with accents. That is actually an insanely hard problem, because a lot of other voice tools don't solve for that. That has been a big thing for us, because whisper today is used in across 124 countries with people speaking 90 different languages. 60% of our user base is outside the US, and so we have to deal with people with accents all the time, and so that is, again, the fore part of the technology, where it works regardless of your accent. And I'd love for you to try it out and if it fails ever so that is when we'll fix it. Awesome. I know Max said last question, so I'm around after this. If there's any more questions. Us. Thanks.

S Speaker 410:24right, I'm Lee Hal. I'm tiny fish. I lead power cooking market. You've heard a lot of pitches today, and you'll hear some more. So I'm going to keep mine really simple. In the next 10 minutes, I want to go through who we are, what we do that makes us different, and three use cases where we brought impact Pair with our enterprise partners. So we do AI agents. That doesn't mean much in this room, because that's what everyone is doing, but we focus on one thing, and one thing really, that is enterprise grade web agents. What that means is we build and deploy agents that can go out there to internet and interact with websites in a way that's very similar to that could mean extracting information, that could mean filling a form, that could mean booking hotel rooms and flights. And we do this at a massive scale, at high accuracy. We're the first converted millions. We've already deployed 30 million users in the past couple months. We started a year ago, but we really just launched a few weeks ago, and we have 20 applied partners. What really sets us apart again is that whole scalability, reliability and accuracy game, the way we think about all the One Shot agents out there, which are awesome. I'm sure you've all seen videos of agents booking vacation for a family of seven or shopping for sneakers. We're different because we see those as a popular high school kid that devils in all sports. We're training for Olympic swimmers who only schools, but every time they do a lot, it comes back. World record great, world record results, right? And we can again do this at the magnitude of hundreds of 1000s on a single day. The way we do this is we separate the process into learning and deployment. And this is really the way for anyone who wants to do anything. So we take that philosophy in the learning stage. We take our time and invest the energy, explain the agents, understand the goal, understand the context, the websites, pick up skills and understanding and explore different paths when a very efficient and accurate pathway is found, we codify that learning, and that becomes the foundation, which actually happens on CPUs are invoking

We take our time and invest the energy, explain the agents, understand the goal, understand the context, the websites, pick up skills and understanding and explore different paths when a very efficient and accurate pathway is found, we codify that learning, and that becomes the foundation, which actually happens on CPUs are invoking

So when deployment is happening, we're also sending a small batch of agents and learning rules to observe the sites catch changes and make sure that when things change, we retrain the deployment agents to adapt their program, and with that, the whole machine will run very smoothly and reliably regardless of how the world changes.

People can just go through Google, and now he actually used that morning's blog to serve Japanese style breakfast. Smoking is down 5% and people love his breakfast. He loves cooking again. He's no longer responding to Gima house. He's doing what he loves to do the last one. I'll also go over fairly quickly, so there's time for questions. I think this is probably a consensus in this room. The web will become a genetic most of the interaction out there will be agent. And what we do here and now is that critical first step. So I just became a dad not that long ago, and like all new parents, I rely on chat GPT for some of my medical needs with babies. So my question was, one, two degrees fever, local diarrhea. Should I go to a doctor? GPT says yes. Now imagine a world where GP says yes, and based on what I know about you and your child, your insurance and who's around you right now and available for appointment. I also got an appointment and go there and do your hours. So that is what we're trying to build with one of the largest insurance companies right now in this country. We're building agents that are capable of going out to any physician and provider website and putting the right information and secure an appointment for the patients. The end game for this is to integrate that into their current patient portal. So anyone who's on the portal researching physicians can just find in network physicians bulk and file claim in one go, streamline. Imagine the efficiency that would unlock for every single party involved in that process. This so I won't actually, I'll play this when I answer questions, because it's actually, I do want to close with one thing, which is actually the first question people ask when they hear about the word tiny fish, they ask us why we're called tiny fish. We make ourselves tiny fish because we see our web agents of small fishes swimming the ocean, and we really believe that a large army of small fishes, when they're capable and are moving in a coordinate way, can move ocean, can make big things happen. So this is my invitation for you all too soon, alongside with that, I'll take any questions, but I won't put the video on display. You'll see the agents just looking different.

S Speaker 630:55We plug into service force, but we can use our post signature solution as a system of record as well, and the problem we're trying to solve here is CRM links are not popular tools for a few reasons. Number one, they're incredibly expensive to implement. They require a lot of manual work. Number two, they there's enormous change management and then getting a CRM implemented. But third, and maybe the most importantly, the thing that they're ostensibly meant to do, which is extract important information and intelligence from your agreements. They're not actually that good at doing that, and that's not their fault. It's because they were built in an era where the best you could do was manually meta tag agreements and query over those meta tags, when we thought, hey, now that we have llms And they're actually getting pretty good and pretty affordable. Why don't we try to figure out how to solve this problem from the ground up now that we can do that? And one of the things we discovered while trying to solve this problem is that getting contract intelligence extracted accurately is actually a very difficult problem, and there's a number of prerequisites that, yes, you have to solve first before we can do that effectively. For example, our clients, I don't think I've come across a single company we've told. You that all of the contracts are perfectly organized everywhere. In practice, contracts are scattered across a variety of different data sources. In practice, people have mixed up different versions of the agreements and signed agreements with draft agreements. And also in practice, agreements are complicated. Agreements get amended over multiple iterations. Agreements have relationships with other agreements, and all of these need to be taken together when you're when you're extracting information. So one of the first things we did is we built a way to tidy up basically all your existing contract database and want to actually build these relationship trees. And this gets really, really cool, because you can imagine, if you have a query like I'm trying to understand all of the SAS vendor agreements we've agreed to where, where we determination convenience. But to get that information is actually not sufficient just to look at a single document in isolation. You have to look at that document. You have to look at all of the amendments to that document. You have to look at all of the standards of work attached to that document, or the change orders attached to that same bit of work. So one of the things we do just out of the gate is we automatically categorize all of these agreements, we automatically build these relationship trees as well. And then where this gets really interesting is because we categorize all of these agreements here that we can create what we call a data composite view of all of the documents. So in this case, we have an example. This is the vendor contract I showed you earlier. We can see how it's been updated over time. And if I click into each part of that timeline, and we can show you, you added another amendment in 2019 that's how the agreement changed after that amendment, then here's another amendment, then here's a statement of work, and we look at all of that together in sort of totality to extract the information that you need. The other interesting thing as well as we give you a snapshot of the obligations you enter into and the risks you've agreed to at any point in time, historically as well. So that's kind of one of the things we had to do initially. The other thing that we do, and this is sort of the main thing that we do really well, is we extract whatever arbitrary piece of information you want across all of the contracts, and we do this incredibly accurately. And there are two reasons why we can do this really accurately across vast data sets of a million or 10 million agreements. This is an example, one of our working with Fortune 100 company now, and they have this question we're trying to understand, can we pass on the cost of tariffs to all of our customers? And that's an incredibly complicated question to answer if you're trying to answer. They're trying to do this manually, which is what they're trying to do before they found us. You can see here we extracted that information, and we can even click into the relevant view and go straight into the random economy document. And there are two reasons why we can do this very accurately. The first reason is all of the kind of the preliminary work we did to associate agreements together, understand the relationships between those agreements and all the rest of it. And then secondly, just on the accuracy, we've done a lot of work to make the retrieval, extraction self accurate. Reason one data set that stands for contract understanding, the art contract data set. There are 13 labels annotated by human order experts. Against that data set, we have a 97% accuracy rate. In fact, even out of the 3% of times we're not accurate, or at least inconsistent with the human label data set. We actually looked at the results, and it turned out that actually many of those times that humans had an incorrect the data set was wrong and we were right. So this kind of something that we're very excited about and allows us to extract this information across very large success of data. And this exceeds a very complicated information. The hardest piece of information we had to be able to be able to extract from was most favored nation provisions. Independent provisions are interesting, where the semantic meaning of the phrase most favored nation means something very different from the legal definition of the word. And we're very proud that we were able to do that as well. And then just finally, the other product that we have as well as we have this contract review solution. We can review agreements with persistence. Initial playbooks, generate surgical Red Line recommendations. And we have two pieces of feedback we had very recently that kind of speak to this. So one is we had a trial with a fortune 100 tech company. They've been now a customer, and after the trial, they made this comment about how I was very surgical, precise red lines, like how an attorney would do. Then the other piece of feedback we had, this was from another kind of a car manufacturing company. They told us that Ivo understands how we like to Red Line agreements. And I really love this piece of feedback, because one of the big kind of counter to the insights we had was when you're building a red line for these people. Useful with AI tool. One of the most important problems you have to solve is what we call the onboarding problem. If you have a brand new junior employee joining your company and they've been in the company for five minutes, they're probably not going to be that useful. They need to understand things like this is what we care about as a business,
We plug into service force, but we can use our post signature solution as a system of record as well, and the problem we're trying to solve here is CRM links are not popular tools for a few reasons.

You can see here we extracted that information, and we can even click into the relevant view and go straight into the random economy document. And there are two reasons why we can do this very accurately. The first reason is all of the kind of the preliminary work we did to associate agreements together, understand the relationships between those agreements and all the rest of it. And then secondly, just on the accuracy, we've done a lot of work to make the retrieval, extraction self accurate. Reason one data set that stands for contract understanding, the art contract data set. There are 13 labels annotated by human order experts. Against that data set, we have a 97% accuracy rate. In fact, even out of the 3% of times we're not accurate, or at least inconsistent with the human label data set. We actually looked at the results, and it turned out that actually many of those times that humans had an incorrect the data set was wrong and we were right. So this kind of something that we're very excited about and allows us to extract this information across very large success of data. And this exceeds a very complicated information. The hardest piece of information we had to be able to be able to extract from was most favored nation provisions. Independent provisions are interesting, where the semantic meaning of the phrase most favored nation means something very different from the legal definition of the word. And we're very proud that we were able to do that as well. And then just finally, the other product that we have as well as we have this contract review solution. We can review agreements with persistence. Initial playbooks, generate surgical Red Line recommendations. And we have two pieces of feedback we had very recently that kind of speak to this. So one is we had a trial with a fortune 100 tech company. They've been now a customer, and after the trial, they made this comment about how I was very surgical, precise red lines, like how an attorney would do. Then the other piece of feedback we had, this was from another kind of a car manufacturing company. They told us that Ivo understands how we like to Red Line agreements. And I really love this piece of feedback, because one of the big kind of counter to the insights we had was when you're building a red line for these people. Useful with AI tool. One of the most important problems you have to solve is what we call the onboarding problem. If you have a brand new junior employee joining your company and they've been in the company for five minutes, they're probably not going to be that useful. They need to understand things like this is what we care about as a business,
We plug into service force, but we can use our post signature solution as a system of record as well, and the problem we're trying to solve here is CRM links are not popular tools for a few reasons. Number one, they're incredibly expensive to implement. They require a lot of manual work. Number two, they there's enormous change management and then getting a CRM implemented. But third, and maybe the most importantly, the thing that they're ostensibly meant to do, which is extract important information and intelligence from your agreements. They're not actually that good at doing that, and that's not their fault. It's because they were built in an era where the best you could do was manually meta tag agreements and query over those meta tags, when we thought, hey, now that we have llms And they're actually getting pretty good and pretty affordable. Why don't we try to figure out how to solve this problem from the ground up now that we can do that? And one of the things we discovered while trying to solve this problem is that getting contract intelligence extracted accurately is actually a very difficult problem, and there's a number of prerequisites that, yes, you have to solve first before we can do that effectively. For example, our clients, I don't think I've come across a single company we've told. You that all of the contracts are perfectly organized everywhere. In practice, contracts are scattered across a variety of different data sources. In practice, people have mixed up different versions of the agreements and signed agreements with draft agreements. And also in practice, agreements are complicated. Agreements get amended over multiple iterations. Agreements have relationships with other agreements, and all of these need to be taken together when you're when you're extracting information. So one of the first things we did is we built a way to tidy up basically all your existing contract database and want to actually build these relationship trees. And this gets really, really cool, because you can imagine, if you have a query like I'm trying to understand all of the SAS vendor agreements we've agreed to where, where we determination convenience. But to get that information is actually not sufficient just to look at a single document in isolation. You have to look at that document. You have to look at all of the amendments to that document. You have to look at all of the standards of work attached to that document, or the change orders attached to that same bit of work. So one of the things we do just out of the gate is we automatically categorize all of these agreements, we automatically build these relationship trees as well. And then where this gets really interesting is because we categorize all of these agreements here that we can create what we call a data composite view of all of the documents. So in this case, we have an example. This is the vendor contract I showed you earlier. We can see how it's been updated over time. And if I click into each part of that timeline, and we can show you, you added another amendment in 2019 that's how the agreement changed after that amendment, then here's another amendment, then here's a statement of work, and we look at all of that together in sort of totality to extract the information that you need. The other interesting thing as well as we give you a snapshot of the obligations you enter into and the risks you've agreed to at any point in time, historically as well. So that's kind of one of the things we had to do initially. The other thing that we do, and this is sort of the main thing that we do really well, is we extract whatever arbitrary piece of information you want across all of the contracts, and we do this incredibly accurately. And there are two reasons why we can do this really accurately across vast data sets of a million or 10 million agreements. This is an example, one of our working with Fortune 100 company now, and they have this question we're trying to understand, can we pass on the cost of tariffs to all of our customers? And that's an incredibly complicated question to answer if you're trying to answer. They're trying to do this manually, which is what they're trying to do before they found us.

Now they have 30 million agreements there's literally important. It just doesn't matter. Like operation, in agreement. So step one is understanding the obligation to agree to that is like 99% job, and then 1% part of your operators understand, okay, now they're regulatory change. This is a good example. In Australia, there's this new regime for the CPSU Bernie regime. We work with a number of large financial institutions in Australia, and when they regime or without pay, to understand possible their portfolio agreements, what are the vendor agreements they agreed to, and which ones contain certain language that needs to be updated in light of this very regulatory regime.
