S Speaker 30:30We house client. Like, client is also open, no, but is it like from revenue perspective, north of 100?

S Speaker 20:39No, their monetization hasn't kicked up. It's largely open source. So when we were talking, I wouldn't say at all. This was six months ago. Tushar, they were early monetization. That's why we were surprised that he's asking us to pitch. I think they were still refining how to get enterprises to pay. So he was testing that with us as to, why would you pay? Because we can use the open source right? So that's where, that's what we are using internally, but we wanted to understand what additional features they offer.

S Speaker 11:11So after client so the client team, it's just very difficult for you to convince yourself you want to back that team on a weird backgrounds. Then, then there's the offshoot of root code, which is better than kilocode, I think, which is even better on the team. And I think the product has some improvements as well, right? But we are keeping mind like this phase, that people can easily branch it off and, you know, just do something, and monetization is still going to be a big problem

S Speaker 11:48and kind of get the ideas, hey, let's do the agent layer right? Why do why do we let everybody else enjoy the benefits and do it on their own and actually outperforms many of the outside solutions? So the other day, I was listening to this podcast from ethereopic, and they basically mentioned the cloud code. The reason so good is because when it was trained, was trained as a large action model, and they learned all the workflows. So it's very, very good. It is trained as an agent to begin with, and coding just happened to be one of the things the agent does. So they package it as a cloud code. But you will see that, you know, they also pushing like Cloud for financial services, like they do the financial analysis, and they're doing other things as well. So the Anthro optic, an optics CISO. He was, he was telling, you know, one one time at the panel, say, within anthropic, they are already using claw and claw code to to run their AI SOC functionalities. So basically, all the level one support within anthropic, it's all handled by AI, by their own model. And the model they get so smart, they go connect on the slack. And when they need information, they will text other people, team members on Slack and look for information, and they go repair their infrastructure automatically,

S Speaker 33:24which, I mean, I won't be surprised, they're launching this new framework for the world as well. Now where like for the new agentic framework that they've just launched together and then now open AI is part of that as well.
which, I mean, I won't be surprised, they're launching this new framework for the world as well. Now where like for the new agentic framework that they've just launched together and then now open AI is part of that as well.

S Speaker 13:48yeah. So also, with one the block, right? Also contribute their their agentic framework into it. I think they're like a three party foundation for the agent.
yeah. So also, with one the block, right? Also contribute their their agentic framework into it. I think they're like a three party foundation for the agent.
yeah. So also, with one the block, right? Also contribute their their agentic framework into it. I think they're like a three party foundation for the agent.
yeah. So also, with one the block, right? Also contribute their their agentic framework into it. I think they're like a three party foundation for the agent.
S Speaker 34:01So with all these now, now they all have large scale right? Claude, from what I've read, crossed over a billion dollars in ARR code,
So with all these now, now they all have large scale right? Claude, from what I've read, crossed over a billion dollars in ARR code,
So with all these now, now they all have large scale right? Claude, from what I've read, crossed over a billion dollars in ARR code,

S Speaker 14:19client, I don't know if they break it out claw code, actually, you know, I believe majority of the AR is right came from claw code right now. And they, I think yesterday I saw, they said the AR is at $10 billion now.
client, I don't know if they break it out claw code, actually, you know, I believe majority of the AR is right came from claw code right now. And they, I think yesterday I saw, they said the AR is at $10 billion now.

S Speaker 34:35Also, to you think, like, majority of the 10 billion is from Cloud code, yeah,
Also, to you think, like, majority of the 10 billion is from Cloud code, yeah,
Also, to you think, like, majority of the 10 billion is from Cloud code, yeah,
Also, to you think, like, majority of the 10 billion is from Cloud code, yeah,
S Speaker 14:40because you can see a huge tick, like in May, when they release a clock code. That's when it really accelerated.

because you can see a huge tick, like in May, when they release a clock code. That's when it really accelerated.
S Speaker 34:48I think API is different. No See, I just searched. So recently I hit 1 billion. I just searched and then clock code, AR cloud. Uh, Claude entropic acquires fun as Claude claw, oh, entropic themselves published on December 2, yeah, uh, entropic acquires one as plot code reaches 1 billion miles.
I think API is different. No See, I just searched. So recently I hit 1 billion. I just searched and then clock code, AR cloud. Uh, Claude entropic acquires fun as Claude claw, oh, entropic themselves published on December 2, yeah, uh, entropic acquires one as plot code reaches 1 billion miles.

S Speaker 15:15Okay, so could be, yeah, there it is. It's on entropics website. Okay, so you have to read that, I guess, with different perspective, because they package a clock code as a separate product, but the underlying sonnet is charged separately along coding.

S Speaker 35:36My guess is other like cursor might also use API's, which is not counted in cloud

My guess is other like cursor might also use API's, which is not counted in cloud
S Speaker 15:42code, yes, so clock hole also could drive a lot of sonnet like consumption by API consumption. So they may, they may say clock hole API is a billion, but, but a big part of that sonnet consumption actually could be driven by clock code itself.
code, yes, so clock hole also could drive a lot of sonnet like consumption by API consumption. So they may, they may say clock hole API is a billion, but, but a big part of that sonnet consumption actually could be driven by clock code itself.

Now we just, we just don't know exactly,
S Speaker 36:05I don't know how they're breaking up, but regardless, it's big. What my saying is whether it's a billion, but

S Speaker 36:18Codex is also already pretty big rock. It's actually getting rock very big, which is, I agree, which is not mentioned here, cursor is big. Yes, Devin is also getting big. I don't, I don't know about client.

S Speaker 16:38So Devin, you know Devin? I think it's a little bit of enigma. We talk to people like around in conferences, almost for no one using Devon,

S Speaker 36:52but somebody, no somebody said Devin crossed 100 million ASR, essentially. That's not billions, but, yeah, 100 so which is still big for now that question, I guess they're

S Speaker 17:08the first one to come out with agent, right? Great software engineering. Agent, yep, and it took them this long, and when they eventually released their agent, I think they priced it at like $500 per agent per month, or something, I think the lowest tier. So they're a lot of, they're plugged with a backslash on the community. Yeah, I just

S Speaker 27:33it just kind of classified. Love my agent. Most people I talk to,
it just kind of classified. Love my agent. Most people I talk to,

S Speaker 17:50Well, yeah, but that's more on the consumer side. The logos that listed here. They mostly like more enterprise relevant, right? So I

S Speaker 511:15There's always visual automotive, there's a camera, and it's you seeing the stairs and able to climb the stairs. And this is not twice out of the box without any fine reading the simulation. And in this case, we are very similar simulation like this. We are not trying very clearistic simulations. We are actually trying to diversify simulation. Now, the cause of simulation between all the GPS used to get more and more data fast. But the cause, of course, is diversity still very, very high, right? Because how many scenes, it depends on that. And there are approaches now. People are trying to pursue whole generation and all that stuff. And then there's always into real gap. So how do you bridge that simple, real gap itself,

S Speaker 10:00Was, you know, get together and build this. But interesting company was pretty good, so a lot of companies are using it.S Speaker 20:10We had a weird call with Klein, so I connected the QCS guys, and their sales guy was asking us to pitch him why we should0:19use Klein. Yeah,S Speaker 20:23he was like, tell me, why should Qualcomm use client? I like, Dude, you are this. You are the sales guy for client. Anyway, it was a weird call.S Speaker 30:30We house client. Like, client is also open, no, but is it like from revenue perspective, north of 100?S Speaker 20:39No, their monetization hasn't kicked up. It's largely open source. So when we were talking, I wouldn't say at all. This was six months ago. Tushar, they were early monetization. That's why we were surprised that he's asking us to pitch. I think they were still refining how to get enterprises to pay. So he was testing that with us as to, why would you pay? Because we can use the open source right? So that's where, that's what we are using internally, but we wanted to understand what additional features they offer.S Speaker 11:11So after client so the client team, it's just very difficult for you to convince yourself you want to back that team on a weird backgrounds. Then, then there's the offshoot of root code, which is better than kilocode, I think, which is even better on the team. And I think the product has some improvements as well, right? But we are keeping mind like this phase, that people can easily branch it off and, you know, just do something, and monetization is still going to be a big problem1:44in the meantime, like Claw CoS Speaker 11:48and kind of get the ideas, hey, let's do the agent layer right? Why do why do we let everybody else enjoy the benefits and do it on their own and actually outperforms many of the outside solutions?

He was, he was telling, you know, one one time at the panel, say, within anthropic, they are already using claw and claw code to to run their AI SOC functionalities. So basically, all the level one support within anthropic, it's all handled by AI, by their own model. And the model they get so smart, they go connect on the slack. And when they need information, they will text other people, team members on Slack and look for information, and they go repair their infrastructure automatically,S Speaker 33:24which, I mean, I won't be surprised, they're launching this new framework for the world as well. Now where like for the new agentic framework that they've just launched together and then now open AI is part of that as well.3:44Yeah. So,S Speaker 13:48yeah. So also, with one the block, right? Also contribute their their agentic framework into it. I think they're like a three party foundation for the agent.S Speaker 34:01So with all these now, now they all have large scale right? Claude, from what I've read, crossed over a billion dollars in ARR code,4:16that's what the information run, recentS Speaker 14:19client, I don't know if they break it out claw code, actually, you know, I believe majority of the AR is right came from claw code right now. And they, I think yesterday I saw, they said the AR is at $10 billion now.S Speaker 34:35Also, to you think, like, majority of the 10 billion is from Cloud code, yeah,S Speaker 14:40because you can see a huge tick, like in May, when they release a clock code. That's when it really accelerated.S Speaker 34:48I think API is different. No See, I just searched. So recently I hit 1 billion. I just searched and then clock code, AR cloud. Uh, Claude entropic acquires fun as Claude claw, oh, entropic themselves published on December 2, yeah, uh, entropic acquires one as plot code reaches 1 billion miles.S Speaker 15:15Okay, so could be, yeah, there it is. It's on entropics website. Okay, so you have to read that, I guess, with different perspective, because they package a clock code as a separate product, but the underlying sonnet is charged separately along coding.S Speaker 35:36My guess is other like cursor might also use API's, which is not counted in cloudS Speaker 15:42code, yes, so clock hole also could drive a lot of sonnet like consumption by API consumption. So they may, they may say clock hole API is a billion, but, but a big part of that sonnet consumption actually could be driven by clock code itself.6:02Now we just, we just don't know exactly,S Speaker 36:05I don't know how they're breaking up, but regardless, it's big. What my saying is whether it's a billion, butS Speaker 16:13it's a main driver, and the company is all eight on these.S Speaker 36:18Codex is also already pretty big rock. It's actually getting rock very big, which is, I agree, which is not mentioned here, cursor is big. Yes, Devin is also getting big. I don't, I don't know about client.S Speaker 16:38So Devin, you know Devin? I think it's a little bit of enigma. We talk to people like around in conferences, almost for no one using Devon,S Speaker 36:52but somebody, no somebody said Devin crossed 100 million ASR, essentially. That's not billions, but, yeah, 100 so which is still big for now that question, I guess they'reS Speaker 17:08the first one to come out with agent, right? Great software engineering. Agent, yep, and it took them this long, and when they eventually released their agent, I think they priced it at like $500 per agent per month, or something, I think the lowest tier. So they're a lot of, they're plugged with a backslash on the community. Yeah, I justS Speaker 27:33it just kind of classified. Love my agent. Most people I talk to,S Speaker 17:38they use, they use cursor and callS Speaker 37:45classified lovable, like lovable. Would you classify them as a coding agent?S Speaker 17:50Well, yeah, but that's more on the consumer side. The logos that listed here. They mostly like more enterprise relevant, right? So I8:34Okay, thank you, sir, right here, yes, all right, it's good. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Have a Nice day. You too. Bye. YouS Speaker 49:46Oh, yes, I PriyeshS Speaker 29:55P, R, i, Y, E, S, H, Priyesh P, Yes, okay,10:55it simulation.S Speaker 511:15There's always visual automotive, there's a camera, and it's you seeing the stairs and able to climb the stairs. And this is not twice out of the box without any fine reading the simulation. And in this case, we are very similar simulation like this. We are not trying very clearistic simulations. We are actually trying to diversify simulation. Now, the cause of simulation between all the GPS used to get more and more data fast. But the cause, of course, is diversity still very, very high, right? Because how many scenes, it depends on that. And there are approaches now. People are trying to pursue whole generation and all that stuff. And then there's always into real gap. So how do you bridge that simple, real gap itself,12:06last but not the least, the.How accurate was this transcription?
