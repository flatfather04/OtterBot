S Speaker 12:35with you absolutely Jared. And yeah, I got to know about espresso from Sarah from Geek venture. So highly respect her. She has been very strong network for deal flow for us. So would love to talk further. And then, in terms of deep tech, what we have done Janet recently is we have been expanding into more AI investments. And in that aspect, yes, we do look at some of some companies which have a higher compute load, given that we can support some of that computer platforms, across mobile, PCs and cloud platforms. I can imagine espresso might not fit the bill perfectly, but we are quite flexible in our investment thesis from that perspective as well. So happy to discuss further, see if it's a fit or not, but in any case, if you feel there is any opportunities to partner with Qualcomm, we do partner with a lot of startups for our internal use cases as well. So happy to explore some of those avenues as well.

I'm on this weird thing.
S Speaker 112:31is, this is pretty interesting, Jared, and I get the immediate ROI, the only question I have is this optimization is happening per ska? SKU, right? Yeah. Do you do you come across situation you don't have enough volume per SKU to sort of actually optimize this on the right level? And also, do you take some insights out of different SKUs for one particular retailer and sort of implement them across different products?

S Speaker 213:03I think you're like defining our I think you got us pretty well figured out. So it is at the skew level. But just to kind of drill down, with the retailer hat on, obviously, this sweater could be small, medium, large, or it could be brown or gray. That is all up to the merchant if they want. We've actually had a merchant that sells T shirts that we you know, I want my crew neck, my crew neck shirts to match my V neck, like they didn't, even though the agents might find, you know, more lift or more benefit, they wanted the V neck and the crew neck to always be the same. So there are attachments and coupling. It's called, like, I guess, line pricing in retail that, again, is all configurable, so you're going to trade out a little bit of performance, but it's a better brand experience, you know that, and we're here to amplify the merchants brand. Also very interesting, what you described our head of AI. Believe he's working on this. This is like his, you know, q2, q3, marching orders. Very important. What you describe cross price elasticities and just he has all these advanced names for partial cooling, all this funds. So one, simple one to be an agent that's acting upon peanut butter. What is it doing to the price of jelly? So this is in same merchant land, so we're starting to figure that out. Like the impact of, you know, the toothbrush to the toothpaste, or, you know, shampoo to conditioner, ketchup must break. You got all those. We are very much on top of knowledge about merchant A and then leveraging that knowledge to the benefit of merchant B or C. We haven't done it yet, just because we don't want to have to revisit, you know, data privacy terms and conditions and things like that, and then we also just don't have the legal, you know, support or background on what we could or should get away with. But yeah, there's no doubt about it. If we know, you know, back to school trends from merchant A and then merchant C, a backpack, it can absolutely drive incremental performance. So that's one that's working its way up the roadmap.

S Speaker 215:29Yeah, yeah, go to market. I'll try that first. I sort of mentioned this previously. You know, within Shopify of their to your point, yes, there are many SKUs that don't qualify, or many merchants. Well, you can see 2.9 merchants don't qualify, right? And also, this is a premium product, right? So the ACV is around 25,000 and up per year. I mean, that's the level when that data density is there. You know, that's the level of results that we bring. You know, it's one of those printing money, you know, pays for itself, type of approach. But, yeah, we're comfortable just in Shopify, you know, targeting these 50,000 merchants. And as we unlock these 50 it's becoming 5152 53 really quickly, based on Shopify growth. And, you know, at a modest, you know, Clay deals at like, an 80% penetration rate, we want to be the clay bill of pricing. You know, just Shopify has a well over 300 million opportunity, but we're definitely not going to limit ourselves just to Shopify. So we are. We have active discussions. I don't know if you're familiar with any like East Coast like groceries, but Fresh Direct is like an $800 million delivery grocery service in New York, and we're working with them to sort of manage their pricing. And we're talking to Tory Burch, Perry Ellis. These are 500 600 700 million plus off Shopify opportunities. Now that's the tech trade off, as you know, that would require us to sort of maintain that ad hoc implementation. But of course, you know, this would provide us the capital and the team to attraction, as I mentioned, for the pricing agents, because the API didn't exist on Shopify, and we sort of focused our go to market on Shopify. In the last, you know, six months, we've actually added almost half a million of AR just in April. Of course, admittedly, there was a lot of from tariffs, but yeah, we signed multiple this is at that 25,000 current ACV that will rise over time, but we've been able to land multiple clients per week for a vanilla implementation is down to one day. And we are very much on track to exit December of 2025 with around 4.5 million of ARR from the pricing agent. And then currently, right now, we have around 20 to 22 logos that are live, committed and on deck to be implemented or currently in the immigration and testing phase, right? That's
Yeah, yeah, go to market. I'll try that first. I sort of mentioned this previously. You know, within Shopify of their to your point, yes, there are many SKUs that don't qualify, or many merchants.

S Speaker 118:08very interesting. Jared, and you mentioned expanding into some retail stores or grocery stores, if I'm not wrong, how does that part of the technology work? How do you implement in physical spaces? Yeah,
very interesting. Jared, and you mentioned expanding into some retail stores or grocery stores, if I'm not wrong, how does that part of the technology work? How do you implement in physical spaces? Yeah,

S Speaker 218:20yeah. So we stay out of that game. So Fresh Direct is a they like Instacart. They've been around for a bit, fairly well scaled, right? Yeah, so it, but it would be, yes, an E commerce grocer, basically, but again, doing around 700 million per year. And I think a really exciting Of course, not on Shopify, that's a global platform, so Right? You know, that will challenge us and our team and our tech board to, you know, Shopify, we don't want to be low to sleep, because it's a single app that we maintain. We'll need to go after some of these whales to really hit our growth targets. Very interesting.
yeah. So we stay out of that game. So Fresh Direct is a they like Instacart. They've been around for a bit, fairly well scaled, right?

S Speaker 219:42Awesome. Yeah, no, that's great. Yeah, I really appreciate. I'm kind of jealous of your role with all the growth in the movement, you know, GPUs compute, you know, people competing with Nvidia. But yeah, I'm on the managed pricing train for a bit, but yeah, I'll package up the info and get it over to you. And I'll definitely have a think on the point of sale. That's very interesting to potentially be an opportunity as well. But, and then overall, yeah, if there's something, someone in your network that could take a keen interest would love the intro. But, yeah, that's all great for

S Speaker 120:14sure. Jared, and very quickly, where are you in terms of fundraising? I remember there was a fundraising round that you were planning around this time, where, how big around are you planning to price it, and where are you in the process?

I'll have a chat with the talk sometime tomorrow, and we'll come back quickly on where we stand in this entire process, but, but very interesting. Appreciate your time today, and would appreciate the deck package as well. We'll do a little bit of my own research. Maybe come back to you with few questions, if I have any, but, but this was really interesting. Thanks a lot for it. Yeah. Awesome, thanks.

I'll have a chat with the talk sometime tomorrow, and we'll come back quickly on where we stand in this entire process, but, but very interesting. Appreciate your time today, and would appreciate the deck package as well. We'll do a little bit of my own research. Maybe come back to you with few questions, if I have any, but, but this was really interesting. Thanks a lot for it. Yeah. Awesome, thanks.
