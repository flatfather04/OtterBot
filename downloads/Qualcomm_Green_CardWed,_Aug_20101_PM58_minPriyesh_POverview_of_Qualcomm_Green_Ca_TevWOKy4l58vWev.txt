S Speaker 316:49early. Thanks Ruth, and thanks everyone for your time today. So let's jump in a lot of this. Maybe Ruth has already mentioned, but we're going to walk into the specifics of the process. So what is perm? As we mentioned, perm is going to apply for those individuals who are in the advanced degree category or EB two who do not fall under the niw track, as well as those in the EB three professional category. So for these employees, the green card process is a three step, like we mentioned, and our perm step is our the first step in the process. So perm and we commonly it's commonly referred to, does actually stand for the perm labor certification process. And so perm itself is the Department of Labor's online labor certification system, and it does include, from an employer standpoint, several advertising recruitment, record keeping an equity team, prevailing wage determination. So we'll go through those in detail, but it is a pretty, a pretty detailed process, and it is lengthy, sometimes in terms of the preparation, but technically, you know, in looking at what the program is within the context of the US is objectives, it's ultimately going to be to safeguard the US workforce. So essentially, it does require two employers to certify that employment of a sponsor for national won't impact wages and working conditions of US workers, and ultimately, as Ruth mentioned, that there's no qualified, able and willing us worker to fill the position. So that's kind of the framework behind everything that we're going to do for the perm process. So let's take a step back and let's talk about, kind of what are our initial stages for perm. We could switch over to the next side. We'll kind of walk through what you can expect. So our first step, and Ruth mentioned this a little bit, is going to be determining the minimum requirements for the position. So again, in other categories, we are looking at your specific accomplishments, perhaps you know, to meet the criteria of the role. Here it is what's minimally required for entry to the role prior to joining the company. And so unlike regular hiring practices, when we're looking for soft skills, we're looking for the best fit within our team, the perm process is pretty unique, and that it does require Qualcomm to provide the minimum qualifications for the position. So what's on day one? What does someone need to perform the very basic functions of the role? So that's it's a pretty important step of the process, because these are going to be used not only to evaluate any applicants for the position, ultimately, as a part of the labor market test, but also, as was mentioned, it's a criteria that you must have met prior to joining Qualcomm. So typically, those are finalized and reviewed with your management, and once they are finalized, then we will work with you to confirm that you actually met those requirements. So there's typically going to be evidentiary requirements, for example, your education, background, your documentation, there likely will need to be letters that you will need to obtain either from a prior employer or university. So our team will facilitate those steps with you, and ultimately, once we are able to confirm that you have those requirements, we're going to move on to step two, and that's going to be to submit a prevailing wage request with the Department of Labor. That determination depends on the time of the year, but certainly can take several months, and once it is received, it does allow us to move forward with the next step of the process, which really is going to be the meat of our firm process. It's our labor market test, or also commonly referred to as recruitment. Now, this phase is something that is heavily regulated by Department of Labor and does some pretty specific posting and advertising requires, requirements that the company needs to do a lot of questions that, again, is, you know, like we did recruitment when I was hired, can we use that recruitment? No, this is very specific process is going to happen after the prevailing wage determination is issued, and typically, employee involvement during this period isn't going to be allowed in something that's managed, typically by the business. After the recruitment period ends, there is a mandatory quiet period and an evaluation period that the company has to review any applicants that apply for the position. So as I mentioned before, one of the main objectives of Perm is to confirm that there's no qualified, willing and able US workers. So Qualcomm is required to review the resumes of any applicants that apply for the role. There certainly could be the potential for interview, and they have to be evaluated against those role requirements that were determined at the outset of the case. So from a timing standpoint, certainly in recruitment phase itself, itself typically takes about six months, but certainly the full process can take longer, even up to six months, depending on the volume of applicants that need to be assessed. If no applicant is found, then, well, let's step back on that. Said, if a qualified worker is found, it doesn't mean, essentially, that you can't ever file a firm, but it does cause a delay. Typically, when a qualified us worker is found, there is a holding period, which is typically about six months, where the employer can't file the labor certification. But then again, they will need to reach that level, do a successful involve that second round of recruitment, and then you are able to proceed. You can after that six month period, in the same vein of kind of, you know, protecting us workers, where there are an area where the process, depending on the position, if you require either additional recruitment or waiting periods before ultimately, now in our qualified us, workers that are found during the process can file 188, nine, which is our Labor's contribution nomination, the date the perm is filed with the Department of Labor is going to become what's called your priority date. And we'll talk a little bit more about that in detail shortly, but essentially, it's going to be kind of your place in line for the green card process in terms of the following steps per applications. Right now the process are a little bit lengthy. It's taking about 16 months to be reviewed and certified by the Department of Labor, I will say, unfortunately, Department of Labor, unlike USCIS, is not a fee based system, so there isn't going to be any type of expedite that is available. Unfortunately, one note that I want to put out there is that any permit filed by any company can be subject to what's called a random audit. Maybe the Department of Labor wants additional information. Maybe they want information about the recruitment the labor market test applicants, etc. So certainly, if a audit big issue that can increase your processing time. But with that said, knock on wood all costs. Audit rates traditionally have been low, but once a perm is certified, we can move on to step two, which is called our I 140 immigrant petition. So we'll talk about this first within the concept concepts of Perm, and then we'll talk about it within the concepts of, you know, EB one and also our niw basis. But what is the I 140 petition? Essentially, by this form, Qualcomm, is a testament that they're offering you permanent employment in the US. Now, the key thing is here is it doesn't give you immigration status by any means, but it becomes the foundation of your green card application in terms of moving forward. And we'll walk through that in a little bit more detail shortly. But our perm based I 140 is pretty straightforward. It's going to include a copy of that certified labor certification, which is going to be issued by Department of Labor. And then we'll also need to include evidence that Qualcomm has the ability to pay your salary, ultimately, at the time your green card is issued. And then also, we're going to include all of that evidence that showed you met Qualcomm's requirement prior to joining the company. So as I mentioned, employment verification letter, degrees, all of that, even though we gather it up front, this is the stage where it's actually going to be submitted to the government. Now, the one call out for perm is that the perm and I 140 process are employer position and location specific, therefore there are changes to the role and you are going through perm, certainly something that may need to be restarted or redone. So we can certainly discuss a little bit more about that in detail. Let's talk about our I 140 within the context of EV one and EB two roots touched upon this a little bit more, but these typically are a little bit more detailed. More detailed, right? So we're skipping firm, but because of the way that these preference categories are structured, we have to make a more extensive argument here. We're kind of from day one, starting off with what are the legal requirements for this category, and how does the individual meet them? So typically includes significant documentation as well as a legal argument. Again, that kind of details, kind of how you are a candidate for this category. Once this item 40 is approved, it's going to in both contexts, it locks in your priority, which essentially, as I mentioned before, is going to be our date in line for a green card queue, and then it also locks in our preference category. So EB one, EB two or EB three,
early. Thanks Ruth, and thanks everyone for your time today. So let's jump in a lot of this. Maybe Ruth has already mentioned, but we're going to walk into the specifics of the process.

It's taking about 16 months to be reviewed and certified by the Department of Labor, I will say, unfortunately, Department of Labor, unlike USCIS, is not a fee based system, so there isn't going to be any type of expedite that is available. Unfortunately, one note that I want to put out there is that any permit filed by any company can be subject to what's called a random audit. Maybe the Department of Labor wants additional information. Maybe they want information about the recruitment the labor market test applicants, etc. So certainly, if a audit big issue that can increase your processing time. But with that said, knock on wood all costs. Audit rates traditionally have been low, but once a perm is certified, we can move on to step two, which is called our I 140 immigrant petition. So we'll talk about this first within the concept concepts of Perm, and then we'll talk about it within the concepts of, you know, EB one and also our niw basis. But what is the I 140 petition? Essentially, by this form, Qualcomm, is a testament that they're offering you permanent employment in the US. Now, the key thing is here is it doesn't give you immigration status by any means, but it becomes the foundation of your green card application in terms of moving forward. And we'll walk through that in a little bit more detail shortly. But our perm based I 140 is pretty straightforward. It's going to include a copy of that certified labor certification, which is going to be issued by Department of Labor. And then we'll also need to include evidence that Qualcomm has the ability to pay your salary, ultimately, at the time your green card is issued. And then also, we're going to include all of that evidence that showed you met Qualcomm's requirement prior to joining the company. So as I mentioned, employment verification letter, degrees, all of that, even though we gather it up front, this is the stage where it's actually going to be submitted to the government. Now, the one call out for perm is that the perm and I 140 process are employer position and location specific, therefore there are changes to the role and you are going through perm, certainly something that may need to be restarted or redone. So we can certainly discuss a little bit more about that in detail. Let's talk about our I 140 within the context of EV one and EB two roots touched upon this a little bit more, but these typically are a little bit more detailed. More detailed, right? So we're skipping firm, but because of the way that these preference categories are structured, we have to make a more extensive argument here. We're kind of from day one, starting off with what are the legal requirements for this category, and how does the individual meet them? So typically includes significant documentation as well as a legal argument. Again, that kind of details, kind of how you are a candidate for this category. Once this item 40 is approved, it's going to in both contexts, it locks in your priority, which essentially, as I mentioned before, is going to be our date in line for a green card queue, and then it also locks in our preference category. So EB one, EB two or EB three,
S Speaker 326:07as we talked about, for perm, the date that your perm is filed with the Department of Labor is going to become your priority date, and ultimately locked in once our Iowa 40 is approved before other categories for our EB one or EB two and IW, the date that I 140 file is filed is going to be your priority date. Once the I 140 is approved, it does allow you to retain your priority date. So for purposes of the future protocols, let's say you change employers, change positions that I 140 priority date is able, is available for you to keep. And certainly, if you are an H 1b status, it can be used to extend your H 1b beyond your CTR maximum period, depending on the circumstances. Let's talk a little bit more about premium processing, kind of what our timelines are going to be. So unlike the perm like we talked about, premium processing is going to be available for I 140 petitions. Now, the processing times for the I 140 does depend on the category that you're kind of pursuing, but typically it will take about nine to 12 months under regular processing, with premium processing that does allow USCIS to take expedited action on the case again for an additional fee, depending, again, on the preference category. It could either be 15 calendar days, but for our niw and our multinational manager petitions that it would be 45 calendar days. Now, if there is a business need that would justify the cost of that premium processing, Qualcomm will cover that for an employee. But certainly that is something that is detailed and kind of who qualifies in the company's premium processing policy, which is available at go, slash my q if it's not covered and you'd still like to premium process for personal reasons, you certainly can choose to self fund our one caveat here is that we have seen higher rate of RFPs Request for Evidence, for cases being filed under premium or upgraded to premium in some categories, particular and IW, but certainly trends that we continue to monitor. So in some cases, we do actually recommend file processing. And perhaps if an upgrade is needed later, it certainly could be something discussed, but strategically, it might be just a better path when looking at approvability of the case. With that said, as I mentioned, you can always upgrade later for a small legal fee, and of course, the premium processing fee and our team, once you are at that stage, will be able to discuss the best approach based on, again, our trends that we are seeing within that particular category. So let's talk about our last step in the process, our third step in the green card process. And this is something that every individual, despite kind of what preference category they'll bill, this is their milestone. This is where we want to get, and that's called the adjustment of status process. Now, typically, most employees will file an adjustment status while in the US. The idea is that you're asking the government to change your status as a non immigrant. For example, HMB one holder to someone who is a lawful permanent resident here in the US now, because the US, government does issue a limited number of cards each year, there is a monthly tool called the piece of bulletin that's going to be important in terms of, you know, kind of knowing how long the wait time is going to be, and what this tool is IntelliJ by by the government, and it tells us who is based on their preference category, based on the country of birth, and kind of when they reach their when They have a priority date, so when they have to file their perm, or when they file their form I 140 who is eligible to move forward this month with filing adjustment. Now, as we've mentioned, our EB two perm and EB two and aw are the same. They're not spread out in the feasible attempt. They're going to be under the same general EB two category. Now the difficult piece is that some countries do have longer wait times. For example, India, China and the bulletin, while released monthly, that doesn't necessarily mean that it moves forward every month. It could certainly move backwards. It could stay the same. So predicting kind of how long it's going to be for you to reach the stage, it really is difficult to do whatever certainly can take some time, particularly again, for those from India and China, the process typically is much longer. If you are someone on this call who perhaps has a previously approved I 140 from perhaps another company, you can generally retain that priority date with them, then you do need to go through the first one or two steps with Qualcomm to get to that stage again. Now, once you reach the front of the line, we call that our priority date being current. So that month, Department of visa bulletin says your priority date is eligible for action based on country of birth, based on our preference category, you can actually proceed with this process and filing for the green card. Now this is where, as we've mentioned, your family is brought into the process for the first time, and each individual family member is going to submit an adjustment of status application. So the fragment team will walk you through this process. There typically is individual questionnaires, and perhaps it's some additional documentary evidence that's going to be needed for each individual family member. Now, at this point, you're also going to be able to apply for two ancillary benefits. Number one, an employment authorization document, also known as a VAD, which you know, certainly, as you can allude to, does allow for Employment Authorization. So it could certainly be a backup form before authorization, and it also is going to allow you to apply for a document called an Advanced Parole document. And so the benefit of that document is that it does give you the permission to travel internationally, perhaps without having to go through the visa stamping process. Certainly, both of those are going to be some great benefits to have. And while that Green Card is pending, and it might take some time, but ultimately, for USCIS to adjudicate. Now, with that said, I'm going to turn it over to Ruth, who's going to talk a little bit more about Qualcomm's Green Card policies. Thanks,
as we talked about, for perm, the date that your perm is filed with the Department of Labor is going to become your priority date, and ultimately locked in once our Iowa 40 is approved before other categories for our EB one or EB two and IW, the date that I 140 file is filed is going to be your priority date.

Now, with that said, I'm going to turn it over to Ruth, who's going to talk a little bit more about Qualcomm's Green Card policies. Thanks,
S Speaker 232:13Caroline. Okay, so just an important note, as you navigate this process, Qualcomm's policy is to sponsor one green card path for each employee. And so what does that mean? It means that once you've been identified as having a certain path be the most aligned with your profile and the best for your case, that is the that is the path that Qualcomm will go down for you until it's successful, but they will not support additional or secondary Green Card pass at the same time. So let me give you an example. Let's say that Qualcomm looks at your profile and in collaboration with the bragging and legal team, says, okay, the best, the best case forward for this individual, is the I 140 niw. So let's say we go about preparing the I 140 niw, and it's successful, and you get your I 140 approved, and you're simply waiting to proceed with that next step of the green card application, and you're waiting for your date to become current as Caroline went through. If during that time, let's say you start gathering patents, and you are gaining citations, and you're really building up your resume, and you think, wow, I think I actually might be eligible for the EB one category. Now, at that point, Qualcomm is not going to sponsor the EB one process for you, because they've already secured an I 140 in the EB two category. You're certainly able to take on the EB one process, you know, with us and fund it personally, Qualcomm is certainly supportive of that, but it's not something that they will cover financially for you. Now, I do want to distinguish that from a situation where, let's say we go through the I 140 EV to niw path for you, and after it's prepared and filed, let's say, for some reason, it's unsuccessful, and the government says, you know, we don't think this person is, you know, is qualified for this category, so we're denying the case. At that point, Qualcomm will assess the next best path for you, whether that's refiling the niw, whether that's appealing, the decision, whether that's going down a different track, such as the labor certification or perm based process. But Qualcomm will continue to support one path for you to success to fruition, but just not full paths or an additional path once a night, 140 has already been successful in terms of which path is chosen. It's important to keep in mind that this is an employer driven and sponsored process. So Qualcomm takes into account multiple variables in determining the best path for each employee. It's based on the current immigration landscape, understanding kind of what's happening with the current, you know, government initiatives and policy changes. It's looking at each employee's profile and determining strategically again, which path makes the most sense. So just something important to keep in mind as you navigate this process. If, if a path is chosen for you and you feel strongly that you know you have questions about it, or you want to understand why, or maybe you think a different path is better, you can always you know we welcome those questions. We can always have that dialog, but ultimately, this is an employer driven process. Okay, let's move on to what you can expect next steps with with our team and with Qualcomm. So everyone on the call at this point should has, should have received the survey from the team. The survey takes about 15 minutes to complete. Again, it's questions about you, your profile, your background, and it will allow us to understand which category is best suited for you. Occasionally, we might have to come back and ask for more information or clarification, but usually, the survey will give us what we need to make a determination of the best green card path for you. Once we get the survey results, we'll assess, we'll make a decision, and we'll initiate the appropriate case and send you a request for additional documentation and information needed to go through that specific track. We'll work with you to prepare next steps. We'll provide you with a roadmap of timing and what's needed, and ultimately get that case filed with the government to get you started on your green card process. Again, none of this kicks off without the survey, so I would really encourage you to complete the survey as soon as possible. I you know, I completely understand that completing a survey or going in and completing a questionnaire or providing documents can seem like a lot, right? Everyone is super busy with work, with family, with all the things, but I would encourage you to try to move forward with this as soon as possible. I've seen situations where people get behind it falls off their radar, and before you know it, they're in their fourth year of H, 1b and it's starting to get problematic, right? Because they don't have the necessary Green Card steps in place to secure their continued status and work authorization. So I would encourage you to make time for this. It is a really important process. Okay, last but not least, let's talk about some resources and some support that you can keep in mind as you move forward with the process with Qualcomm and with the Bregman team. So Qualcomm resources, Mandy, who introduced the call, is part of Qualcomm's Global Mobility team. She works alongside Ray Kirby, so they are certainly a great resource for questions, you can also submit a ticket. If you go and go my queue and search global mobility, you can submit a ticket for any immigration related question or Qualcomm policy immigration related question. That's a great resource if you're searching for if your questions about reimbursement related to immigration, you can search immigration expenses. So maybe you go for visa stamping and you think, Okay, well, how do I get this fee reimbursed? That's a great resource for you. And then last, but not least, I know Caroline touched on the premium processing policy. Can also be found by searching premium processing in gomyq, and you can see whether or not certain applications and petitions are covered by the businesses creating a process and policy on the fragment side, we have multiple attorneys and support staff dedicated to Qualcomm employees at every level. There's a full team of support for you, in addition to the team that is working directly with you on let's say your H 1b filing or your green card case. There's also some other areas that you can get in touch with our team if you have questions or need support. So the first one, one of the most popular, is our travel inbox. So Qualcomm travel@bragavan.com if you have any travel questions, what do I carry? What should I know about visas stamping? Any concerns with me traveling that is a great resource to tap into for travel advice. The other inbox, dedicated inboxes are Qualcomm i 94 inbox, so Qualcomm i 90 four@fridayman.com every time you return from travel, you will get an i 94 card, and that is going to dictate your status. And here in the US, it's a really critical document. I know a lot of you on the call might be an f1 status, since you recently went through the H 1b cap lottery, I know that your your i 94 records typically reflect duration of status or DS. But as you transition to H, 1b, status, you will have an i 94 card upon re entry from international travel that reflects an expiration date. It's a super, super critical date. Again, it does govern your status in the US. If you send it to our inbox, I'll call com, 990, four@fragment.com We'll track it make sure the necessary extensions get filed on your behalf. Last but not least, we also have a ticketing system. It's called fragment messenger. If you navigate to the Connect portal and look in the bottom right hand corner, there's a chat feature as well as a ticketing option. So any questions that you might have, if you forget everything else, you can always just log into your connected portal and place a ticket and we will respond to you right away. Last, but not least, our immigration services survey. So a lot of you on the call should have already received a request to complete this survey. I know we all get these right. Whenever we deal with any organization we're asked to complete a survey. I know sometimes having, like, taking the extra five minutes is just, you know, frustrating, or we don't have the time, or whatever, but if you do have five minutes to spare, it means a lot to us. We review them very closely with Ray and Mandy each month, we go through the good feedback and celebrate those wins, we review, you know, the constructive feedback and think about where we need to fill in some gaps or change our protocols. We really do take it very seriously. So any feedback you can offer is always just really important to the team, and we would appreciate that time from you. Okay, so with that, I know we've done a lot of talking, hopefully it's giving you guys a good overview of the green card process and what you can expect next from our team. We have left a fair bit of time here for some Q and A so I know the team is going to get the slido function up and running And Caroline and I can address your questions. I i
Caroline. Okay, so just an important note, as you navigate this process, Qualcomm's policy is to sponsor one green card path for each employee. And so what does that mean? It means that once you've been identified as having a certain path be the most aligned with your profile and the best for your case, that is the that is the path that Qualcomm will go down for you until it's successful, but they will not support additional or secondary Green Card pass at the same time. So let me give you an example. Let's say that Qualcomm looks at your profile and in collaboration with the bragging and legal team, says, okay, the best, the best case forward for this individual, is the I 140 niw. So let's say we go about preparing the I 140 niw, and it's successful, and you get your I 140 approved, and you're simply waiting to proceed with that next step of the green card application, and you're waiting for your date to become current as Caroline went through. If during that time, let's say you start gathering patents, and you are gaining citations, and you're really building up your resume, and you think, wow, I think I actually might be eligible for the EB one category. Now, at that point, Qualcomm is not going to sponsor the EB one process for you, because they've already secured an I 140 in the EB two category. You're certainly able to take on the EB one process, you know, with us and fund it personally, Qualcomm is certainly supportive of that, but it's not something that they will cover financially for you. Now, I do want to distinguish that from a situation where, let's say we go through the I 140 EV to niw path for you, and after it's prepared and filed, let's say, for some reason, it's unsuccessful, and the government says, you know, we don't think this person is, you know, is qualified for this category, so we're denying the case. At that point, Qualcomm will assess the next best path for you, whether that's refiling the niw, whether that's appealing, the decision, whether that's going down a different track, such as the labor certification or perm based process. But Qualcomm will continue to support one path for you to success to fruition, but just not full paths or an additional path once a night, 140 has already been successful in terms of which path is chosen. It's important to keep in mind that this is an employer driven and sponsored process. So Qualcomm takes into account multiple variables in determining the best path for each employee. It's based on the current immigration landscape, understanding kind of what's happening with the current, you know, government initiatives and policy changes. It's looking at each employee's profile and determining strategically again, which path makes the most sense. So just something important to keep in mind as you navigate this process. If, if a path is chosen for you and you feel strongly that you know you have questions about it, or you want to understand why, or maybe you think a different path is better, you can always you know we welcome those questions. We can always have that dialog, but ultimately, this is an employer driven process. Okay, let's move on to what you can expect next steps with with our team and with Qualcomm. So everyone on the call at this point should has, should have received the survey from the team. The survey takes about 15 minutes to complete. Again, it's questions about you, your profile, your background, and it will allow us to understand which category is best suited for you. Occasionally, we might have to come back and ask for more information or clarification, but usually, the survey will give us what we need to make a determination of the best green card path for you. Once we get the survey results, we'll assess, we'll make a decision, and we'll initiate the appropriate case and send you a request for additional documentation and information needed to go through that specific track. We'll work with you to prepare next steps. We'll provide you with a roadmap of timing and what's needed, and ultimately get that case filed with the government to get you started on your green card process. Again, none of this kicks off without the survey, so I would really encourage you to complete the survey as soon as possible. I you know, I completely understand that completing a survey or going in and completing a questionnaire or providing documents can seem like a lot, right? Everyone is super busy with work, with family, with all the things, but I would encourage you to try to move forward with this as soon as possible. I've seen situations where people get behind it falls off their radar, and before you know it, they're in their fourth year of H, 1b and it's starting to get problematic, right? Because they don't have the necessary Green Card steps in place to secure their continued status and work authorization. So I would encourage you to make time for this. It is a really important process. Okay, last but not least, let's talk about some resources and some support that you can keep in mind as you move forward with the process with Qualcomm and with the Bregman team. So Qualcomm resources, Mandy, who introduced the call, is part of Qualcomm's Global Mobility team. She works alongside Ray Kirby, so they are certainly a great resource for questions, you can also submit a ticket. If you go and go my queue and search global mobility, you can submit a ticket for any immigration related question or Qualcomm policy immigration related question. That's a great resource if you're searching for if your questions about reimbursement related to immigration, you can search immigration expenses. So maybe you go for visa stamping and you think, Okay, well, how do I get this fee reimbursed? That's a great resource for you. And then last, but not least, I know Caroline touched on the premium processing policy. Can also be found by searching premium processing in gomyq, and you can see whether or not certain applications and petitions are covered by the businesses creating a process and policy on the fragment side, we have multiple attorneys and support staff dedicated to Qualcomm employees at every level. There's a full team of support for you, in addition to the team that is working directly with you on let's say your H 1b filing or your green card case. There's also some other areas that you can get in touch with our team if you have questions or need support. So the first one, one of the most popular, is our travel inbox. So Qualcomm travel@bragavan.com if you have any travel questions, what do I carry? What should I know about visas stamping? Any concerns with me traveling that is a great resource to tap into for travel advice. The other inbox, dedicated inboxes are Qualcomm i 94 inbox, so Qualcomm i 90 four@fridayman.com every time you return from travel, you will get an i 94 card, and that is going to dictate your status. And here in the US, it's a really critical document. I know a lot of you on the call might be an f1 status, since you recently went through the H 1b cap lottery, I know that your your i 94 records typically reflect duration of status or DS. But as you transition to H, 1b, status, you will have an i 94 card upon re entry from international travel that reflects an expiration date. It's a super, super critical date. Again, it does govern your status in the US. If you send it to our inbox, I'll call com, 990, four@fragment.com We'll track it make sure the necessary extensions get filed on your behalf. Last but not least, we also have a ticketing system. It's called fragment messenger. If you navigate to the Connect portal and look in the bottom right hand corner, there's a chat feature as well as a ticketing option. So any questions that you might have, if you forget everything else, you can always just log into your connected portal and place a ticket and we will respond to you right away. Last, but not least, our immigration services survey. So a lot of you on the call should have already received a request to complete this survey. I know we all get these right.

Okay, so with that, I know we've done a lot of talking, hopefully it's giving you guys a good overview of the green card process and what you can expect next from our team.

S Speaker 342:38And so I do believe there is going to be again, depending on the area of the form that you're referring to, there is going to be specific guidance. And example, particularly, I know for the perm section there, there is, but certainly if you are the particular area of the form that you may have some questions on, may be looking for examples. We may not be able to provide prior answers or anything like that, but certainly we could provide additional guidance. So I would encourage you to reach out. We're happy to accept.

Well, doing permanent I 140 is international travel allowed.
S Speaker 245:05So yes, with a caveat, so I think most people on the call have been selected in the H 1b lottery. If you're in H 1b status or l1 status, there is no restriction on international travel while navigating the perm and the I 140 process, if you are in a non dual intent status like f1 or tn, then there could be some restrictions, or at least considerations, on international travel. Anyone in that situation should have had a separate consultation with one of our attorneys. So again, if you're in f1 status and you want to travel after starting the green card process, there's just some considerations to think about. You can always reach out to the team if you have follow up questions, but I believe most of you on the call should be switching over to HOV status in October, so therefore there would be no restrictions on travel after starting the perm and or I 140 process.
So yes, with a caveat, so I think most people on the call have been selected in the H 1b lottery.

You can always reach out to the team if you have follow up questions, but I believe most of you on the call should be switching over to HOV status in October, so therefore there would be no restrictions on travel after starting the perm and or I 140 process.
So yes, with a caveat, so I think most people on the call have been selected in the H 1b lottery. If you're in H 1b status or l1 status, there is no restriction on international travel while navigating the perm and the I 140 process, if you are in a non dual intent status like f1 or tn, then there could be some restrictions, or at least considerations, on international travel. Anyone in that situation should have had a separate consultation with one of our attorneys.

S Speaker 446:32What happens if my role is changed during the perm filing? Slash I 140 filing? What about role changes after it has been filed.

What happens if my role is changed during the perm filing? Slash I 140 filing? What about role changes after it has been filed.
S Speaker 346:42That's a great question. So if you are someone who's going down the perm based path, it is going to be as I mentioned before, entity, location, position specific. So if any of those change, there certainly could be the requirement to restart the process, redo, depending on where you are, as we talked about before, once your I 140 is approved, you are able to retain that priority date. So for example, let's say I 140 is approved. At that point you change locations, perhaps you are going through the firm process again, then you do have to do the leave certification, but essentially, your place in line for your green card is kind of intact, right? With that said, it certainly depending, depends on the nature of the role change, right? And typically, we'll partner with Qualcomm's Global Mobility team to review and determine whether there is going to be an immigration impact. The other takeaway with role changes, since you know a lot of individuals perhaps are going into H, 1b for the first time, is that typically, again, depending on the nature of the rule change, it may require H 1b amendment before you go into the new position. So it's just really important to keep the Global Mobility team up to date and kind of discuss any of those proposed changes before they happen.

So you either have to have a perm or I 140 filed, if it's still pending, a perm or I 140 filed at the five year mark of your six years of age would be status. So there's a couple different ways that we can go about getting that date a little further out we can recapture time potentially. So there's some different options that we can play around with. That's the general rule. Usually, if someone is getting to that point where it's going to be a little tricky and they're kind of getting close to maxing out, we do start having conversations. Mandy wonder who introduced the call, leads those calls, and we'll talk through contingency plans. And, you know, potential options to work abroad, if that's something the business can support. And there's some different some different kind of options that can be discussed. But technically, if the I, 140 is pending, but it was filed at the five year mark, it is possible to renew the H, 1b on a yearly basis until it's adjudicated, at which point, if you're back logged on the visa bulletin that Caroline went through, you can then file in three year increments.

S Speaker 251:46yes, so it's actually a good thing to transition into h 1b status, because h 1b status is a dual intent category, so you are permitted to be in the US and H 1b status as what's called a temporary non immigrant, and also pursue permanent residency via the firm or I 140 process. So there's no restrictions on each 1b holders to navigate that process. So it is a positive thing to shift over from PAC one status if you're in any sort of green card process. I I've

So I can jump in on this one.
S Speaker 152:38We have not filed very many firms, because we had layoffs for the last two years. As you, as you might be aware, I don't think that it's the denial rate is higher under the Administration. We're just seeing kind of different market trends right now. We're seeing more US applicants apply for our firm. Labor market tests and so on. Our success rate once we file a firm is still extremely high. I care like our Ruth correct me might be 100% I don't think that we've seen a perm denial in many years. That's correct. Andy,

S Speaker 153:26So this goes back to the kind of initial screening that fragment assists us with. At the beginning, you're going to fill out that survey, and if it's determined that you qualify for niw, that is the track that will be sponsored on your behalf. Otherwise, perm is the kind of only other option.

S Speaker 254:00So it really depends on the type of I 140 filings. So a perm based I 140 is specific to your employer. So if, let's say employer a filed a perm in an I 140 for you, that is only valid to adjust status or apply for a green card with employer A, so Qualcomm can't take that I 140 and leverage it to get your green card. Now, if you have an I 140 approved in a certain category that allows for Qualcomm to take advantage of it, such as, like a self sponsored EB one a or maybe a self sponsored niw, then yes, Qualcomm could take advantage of that I 140 to support you in the green card process. If you already have your adjustment of status or green card application pending, and it's been pending for 180 days, then you are potentially portable, and we could port over the entire application to Qualcomm. Again, those questions are all asked in the survey, so we'd be able to ascertain kind of what's you know available to you. The other point, I want to notice, even if the I 140 is not quote, unquote, portable, right, because it's a perm based I 140 you can always retain that priority date with the Qualcomm filing. And I see that you have your hand up, I can clarify if you have additional questions. Yes.

When I start the new book here, let's say to keep the same priority at the time 140 which is in Eb two, can I get the information that was already fed like, basically, I just don't want to kind of mess up the new because the job description was way older than any different kind of thing.

S Speaker 355:52I was gonna say, so the perm kind of the position of the underlying perm, it's going to be specific to that particular role within the company. So to an extent, if you are going to be going through the process again the prior perm requirements that were identified by the prior company, they're really not applicable at this point. It'll be based on Qualcomm's minimum requirements for the position now and their job description as well, for the role that you're going to be sponsored for again, if going through the program, okay,

S Speaker 556:18but could we get that document that was spent. And is it possible then documents are the answers that I had used to file at the time. Can I actually get an answer to it? Or can you request that particular thing so that I can use it as a base for finding the new I want here? I

S Speaker 256:38could jump in here. So unfortunately, each fragment office does operate a little bit separately, so we can't, we can't provide you with like a perm for a prior employer that may be a different fragment office or even our fragment office represents. We do have to. We have certain ethical obligations to our clients the same way we couldn't take, like a Qualcomm document and provide it to another employer in support of their immigration process. So unfortunately, we can't do that. You can certainly feel free to reach out to your prior employer or to your prior fragment team and ask if it's possible to obtain copies of certain documents. But we, as counsel for Qualcomm, we can't do that on your behalf, unfortunately, but again, our team will work with you on the perm process, and you know, descriptions and what we need and where that can be gathered from.
