So we had a long event that day, and then the next day was our global offsite. So all of our global teams came in. We We drove to Monterey, and everyone is just coming back to base. We just returned this afternoon, so glad we could make time, and I hope it wasn't a lot of trouble on your end. The good thing was

S Speaker 12:22Yeah, so you're going in for a customer conversation. Is this an active customer or, yeah, okay, super interesting. Satim. So, so we, I think just setting the broader stage, we have enjoyed the conversation so far. I think the thesis is matched quite a lot, specifically how Deepak and I are seeing about this space. Today, we wanted to continue unpacking the product a little bit more. So I saw you sent out the demo video. Just try to understand more about how the intent pieces mentioned. You mentioned the intent flag that was there. So try to understand that a little bit just the intent engine, and on the customer side as well. How does it look like when a customer is setting up and policy, a guardrail, setting up those intents and things like that, and then, essentially, in the end, probably spend a little bit time on GTM, absolutely.

S Speaker 13:36Just, just like a quick question. Meanwhile, I was going through the past notes. And you had mentioned you cover 15,000 applications so far, right? That's quite a quite a large category. How do you sort of identify if, say, there are false positives in the system, you're missing something. What's the source of truth? And how do you add a new

S Speaker 23:58AI application there? Yeah. So, so see Priyesh, that's where the thing is, right? I mean, if you look at it at a very high level, everything looks the same, very, very promptly put, you know? I mean, I have talked to many people. They're basically saying, oh, AI, security is highly undefeated, right? But I'm happy that you want to kind of uncover the product, because this is where the innovations will come out. Yeah. Okay, so, hey, so, so people just catch your Priyesh was asking, like, you know, if you say 15,000 How do you look at 15,000 AI services? Now, what I will say is, what is an AI first cyber security company, right? So what we've done is we've got one agent. I'll talk about multiple different things. I've got one agent that basically scours the internet, looks at LinkedIn, Reddit, all of that kind of stuff. Looks at conversations that are happening about AI products, and pulls them back and says, Here's the list of URLs. By the way, this is a death so then the researcher agent kicks in and says, Oh, by the way, this is available as a desktop application or a web browser extension and all of that. So that's how we have built that database. Then we have another agent, or a multi agent combination, which basically, like, one of them only looks at compliance, one of them only looks at like data policies and stuff, because our unique thing over there, and you know, I'll showcase that to you as well. So for example, if I'm doing a discovery and I pull up like a risk report for, let's say deeply, right? So how it actually came here is we built a like that, 15,000 things that we know about, web browser extension, code editor, plugin and stuff we know about, all of them that's the database, and you've got multiple dimensions across this, right? So compliance, data policy, llms and data processing has been working with some of the CPG companies. They brought up some very interesting things, saying, Oh, this is static. How about I tell you what industry I am and adjust it accordingly, like healthcare, HIPAA becomes the most important compliance. CPG software is the most important one. So there's all these adapters, risk profiles and things that we've done using a combination of three agents now a second set of IP that we are working on. You guys know about Sase and stuff like that? Right? What is one of the key difference in the generative AI? You need to go down to the content and the prompt. You need to understand applications like nobody else's business, right? But in sase, no matter which sase provider that you take, has a team of 100 people looking at, oh, this application chain, that application chain, right? We do that with AI. So to be honest. I mean, we are at about 80% automated, 20% of human at the moment. We think by end of November, early part of December, that will be fully automated. And then what you will see is, we support all 15,000 application signatures. How so, for example, we again built an agent which feeds off of the initial three agents that I'm talking about. It says, Oh, I discovered this new AI tool. Go figure out the website. Read about it, figure out how to do it. Then it comes back and says, Hey, this is a paid service. I can't do much give you prediction, so we have to go subscribe for it, or whatever. And then what it does is we use computer vision to then start doing automated things like, Oh, this is a prank. This is a this thing. This is a file attachment. We keep doing this, and then we have the whole capture of everything, and based on that capture, we automatically generate the application signature. Now what happens is, let's say, at 2am something breaks, so we have all these ongoing tests running, and it can handle AB testing across the globe, right? So we have four or five instances of this running anytime something fails, it says, did the test fail? Did the product fail? Or has the application changed its signature? So by the time the developer shows up in two, three hours or whatever, he actually has a PR saying, Oh, by the way, the product has this bug. Go fix this bug. Or, by the way, I mean, you know, the signature, the guys have added a new API, or they rename something. So we like every part of the product that we built. We have AI, otherwise we couldn't have done it with so few people that explain? As I told you, you know, when we support about 100 services, right now, you'll be using like, 80% automatic generator. We tested out this theory, and it's seeming to work. Well. My team's promising me that by end of November, 1 part of December, we'll be like, it's going to be a compute and AI thing like, put in $10,000 we have 10,000 signatures. So that's just like, how we are scaling, just the signature aspect, yeah, and maybe didn't
AI application there? Yeah. So, so see Priyesh, that's where the thing is, right? I mean, if you look at it at a very high level, everything looks the same, very, very promptly put, you know?

S Speaker 39:14want to just go into the application side, but a couple of things on the application side could be, let's say if you want to stop the agent function, right? Embedded agent that workday has deployed, right? So maybe, or maybe, you know, you want to only, read, only access or write, you know, write with supervision, kind of access, or the human in the loop, access, right? Do you have granularity or granular control inside the application, yeah. So let me

S Speaker 210:49I mean, that is bound to happen, you know? I mean, I know that there is this big wave about, I'm building an AI agent for a sock. You know? I think we're living in some amazing times where I compare it to AWS, like when Ws and then just kept seeing what you do in your VM, and the most number of VMs became a service in AWS. And that's what's going to happen. Any anything that's making money will be provided as the first class service with Lord, with, yeah, we have to be careful.
I mean, that is bound to happen, you know? I mean, I know that there is this big wave about, I'm building an AI agent for a sock. You know? I think we're living in some amazing times where I compare it to AWS, like when Ws and then just kept seeing what you do in your VM, and the most number of VMs became a service in AWS. And that's what's going to happen. Any anything that's making money will be provided as the first class service with Lord, with, yeah, we have to be careful.

S Speaker 311:21This is just six hours ago this, and I think it creates more problems than it solves, but, yeah, something to something to keep an eye on, right? It's not, it's not going after your value prop. It's going after the SOC automation companies.

S Speaker 211:39And, yeah, that's what, that's exactly what I'm saying. Lord does phenomenal. How can you build an agent on top of Claude and not
And, yeah, that's what, that's exactly what I'm saying. Lord does phenomenal. How can you build an agent on top of Claude and not

S Speaker 211:54coming to application and Agent execution. We have very deep stuff in here. If you just look at like, how we are doing this. At one time you look at any rag or an agent architecture, basically a rag is talking to llms, red, yellow, green is basically different risk level of different risk level of storage. You go from a rag to an agent. You just add tools to do intelligent things. So you are very familiar with this, but there's a bunch of threads and all that. Again, you're very familiar with that. Yeah, yeah. What do we have? We do have a red teamer, but we are not productizing it yet. Like, I mean, internally everything we build we have to break right. What we have is AI firewall, runtime security. We have a bunch of detectors that we have built, all of these ground up authorization flaw detectors and things like that. And I'll go into every one of them, AI firewall. And this is where you start seeing we start setting ourselves apart, basically what we have done. And one of the things I will bring up is we built workload identity in my previous company. We were deployed in Paypal, 100,000 workload comp. Comcast, half a million workloads. You know the problem that some of these companies are having. You need to have an enterprise kind of a mechanism. How do you do it? So what we do in our runtime security is visibility and monitoring. Tell me what the hell is going on. Application graph, inventory logs. Then comes access policy, everything, multi cloud, cryptographic identity. You can access any LLM from anywhere. We guarantee your secure encryption. Policy based encryption your agent didn't have encryption. Turn it on authentic. Doesn't mind detections and guardrails. We have built our own, and we are extremely pluggable in the sense, if you tell me saying, Hey, man, I want to use open source this module, sure, here's click, click, we're done. Or basically, if you say, like, I want you to use my DLP engine for data classification. Basically, when you the data is going through, we know what the data is, and we have made this API compatible, kind of a thing where you can literally integrate any tool, overload, controls, model, runtime security. We don't build ml bomb. We validate and we do runtime integrity checker. Okay, deploy.
coming to application and Agent execution. We have very deep stuff in here. If you just look at like, how we are doing this.

S Speaker 314:23Maybe Satyam on the on the previous slide. No visibility and monitoring. Of course, this is the way the company will check is, you know when you're deploying it. They might do their own checks on how good your visibility product is, right? And they might call out if these applications are missing, or these are applications are new. I think you might have the coverage today, like maybe close to 100% right? Access policies. I think this you take from intra or, like some IDP, right?

14:55OK, so let me, let me show you, yeah, okay,
OK, so let me, let me show you, yeah, okay,
OK, so let me, let me show you, yeah, okay,
OK, so let me, let me show you, yeah, okay,
S Speaker 215:01this is the application graph, yeah, okay, and I had showed you this one, and I told you a major upgrade is coming. Yeah, the major upgrade has just landed. What all, what all data sources, is my agent talking to? What all AI servers is it talking to? It's showing you green because it's encrypted. If it will go yellow and red, and it will start showcasing all of these problems, things like that. And what I will show you interesting thing over here is you're asking about access policies and things. We've got this very interesting thing called a manifest. And when you're in an enterprise and 20 different teams are building 20 different things. You can define this in our UI, or think about this manifest being a contract between a developer has built something, and they said, Well, I have built this particular agent which is going to have these kind of components. It's going to have an agent. It's going to talk to talk to this data sources. It's going to talk to this LLM and things like that. Think about it this way that every agent that is getting deployed, people are like, Mr. Ai engineer, what did you do? And
this is the application graph, yeah, okay, and I had showed you this one, and I told you a major upgrade is coming. Yeah, the major upgrade has just landed. What all, what all data sources, is my agent talking to? What all AI servers is it talking to? It's showing you green because it's encrypted.

Think about it this way that every agent that is getting deployed, people are like, Mr. Ai engineer, what did you do? And
S Speaker 316:12or, right? It's like a YAML, YAML file for any Kubernetes workload, right?
or, right? It's like a YAML, YAML file for any Kubernetes workload, right?
or, right? It's like a YAML, YAML file for any Kubernetes workload, right?
or, right? It's like a YAML, YAML file for any Kubernetes workload, right?
S Speaker 216:17Yeah, yeah. But basically, any kind of agentic thing that you can, like we can, we can. If you deploy in Kubernetes, I'll generate it. I'll tell you. This is what I have seen. Security guy, is this what you want? You just say one click, we're done. Now, what I will show you in there is it has not only got the structure. So we start off the workflow with you deployed me on Kubernetes, I'll tell you everything that's happening. And then you say, go figure out what what is this? So what you what you will see is you're seeing components in here, right? You're seeing components in this agent, but you're also seeing policies embedded in it. Who am I allowed to talk to? Am I not allowed to talk to? And you know, the world is making a lot of noise about how any agentic identity. Well, agentic identity, if you don't plug in any system, every one of our agents has a cryptographic identity, right? Platform engineers have like, we are giving them a team where the platform engineers are basically saying 20 agents, or 2000 agents, every printed agent. I have made it repeatable. Every one of these boxes will start highlighting problems and things, and this is from an application graph perspective, but I, I had shown you, like this whole detail like, okay, that's the application graph of what it did over 30 days, right? I've got every transaction, and every transaction like you may have done 10,000 transaction we are able to with very low false positive. Highlight that. Here's the top five critical things why I have categoric proof that there is a privilege escalation and things like that happening so our age, like, you know, agentic side for us, as we were showcasing the the original part, I'll tell you, right? I mean,
Yeah, yeah. But basically, any kind of agentic thing that you can, like we can, we can. If you deploy in Kubernetes, I'll generate it. I'll tell you. This is what I have seen.

S Speaker 318:13so sucking on this one. The reason I'm trying to understand the agentic side, when a developer is building an agent, he's also coordinating with your system, right?

S Speaker 218:27So, yeah, so let me explain. So see, typically, in every organization you build an application, the security guy shows up saying it's going to take two hours. You need to tell me everything, what it what? Yeah, what have? Happening in AI is the AI engineer is so knowledgeable that they are basically telling the security groups.
So, yeah, so let me explain. So see, typically, in every organization you build an application, the security guy shows up saying it's going to take two hours.

18:52What we are giving them is,
What we are giving them is,
What we are giving them is,
What we are giving them is,
S Speaker 218:54when we go to the platform ml SEC ops team or the dev SEC ops team, we just basically say, hey, just tell me what your standardized platform is. I don't care if you're building with two AI or open AI or langkin or land, you'll deploy these. I will find everything for you. Okay? And then I'll give you ammunition to the security team that they can talk to the developer, saying I am observing these issues. Is this correct? I have proof for this. And now the AI engineers and the ML stack of team starts working very well together. The alternative approach, if this approach makes sense, they agree, saying, hey, from here on, every company has an AI steering committee. Let's say you built a cool AI agent, and Priyesh built the landscape agent. All we are saying is, hey, we go, let's say we standardize on a containerized platform. You write your code, it goes through a CICD pipeline, right? I have all the code scanning results. I have the ML bomb. I have the S bomb and everything. By the way, whenever you build an agent, you have to put a one page document which says, what all data sources are you going to talk to? What all
when we go to the platform ml SEC ops team or the dev SEC ops team, we just basically say, hey, just tell me what your standardized platform is.

You write your code, it goes through a CICD pipeline, right? I have all the code scanning results. I have the ML bomb. I have the S bomb and everything. By the way, whenever you build an agent, you have to put a one page document which says, what all data sources are you going to talk to? What all

S Speaker 221:51injection, yeah. So to be very honest, the security substrate that I'm actually showing you, if you're using an open AI API. They might have the safety team. If you're using Cloud, they may have the safety team. But when you using Mistral, who's doing that security Lama, what you're doing so what I'm giving you a guarantee is whether you use deep seek or llama or whatever, when you have the security substrate in front, first of all, I'll tell you every problem that is happening, and I'm giving you a common substrate to win the enterprise confident.

S Speaker 322:31And this will also be done at the network level, right?
And this will also be done at the network level, right?
And this will also be done at the network level, right?
And this will also be done at the network level, right?
S Speaker 222:35It's a combination. See what happens is when we deploy it as a Kubernetes even set, let's say, Yeah, I know about Kubernetes metadata, which is why I can actually give an identity to the agent, saying you are an agent with the new chatbot demo, and by the way, you're running in us in this cluster. This is from my previous activity, right? But we just said, Hey, that works beautifully over there. So if I take all those labels, think of them as spokes in the user thing like, what is often users have that workload identity. But if a company says we're zero or we're going to use Bing identity, when we just say, sure you have your own identity, that activity has, but just plug into that one and get a token from there. It doesn't matter, right? So it's a very pluggable system from that perspective. And we recently got some good feedback from Morgan Stanley. They said, How come we don't know about you. I just think, yeah, that's what I need to bump up my marketing. So we, we took a different approach, right? I mean, we took an approach where we, we wanted to have the confidence from the enterprises that whatever is the use case, we have a solid, solid solution from that perspective.

S Speaker 323:56And maybe, I think the focus on agents. I understand the market is pulling it there. Deloitte is saying they have agents deployed. Walnut Stanley is saying they've also deployed but you know the two approaches that you talked about? One is most mostly like a manifestos. The other one where you integrated with some of these tools, right?

24:18There is a How should I say is
There is a How should I say is
There is a How should I say is
There is a How should I say is
S Speaker 324:22a change in behavior for these guys who are building agents right today. How are like the ones who are building agents, they are not even defining the scope well enough, right, of what the agent can do or cannot do, right? And you'll be getting the manifest, and it depends highly on how good the manifest is, right? So my question to you is, let's say, if you want to create a usage tracking of an agent and create a real time database of, Hey, these are the actions that has been performing consistently or next week it deviated from that action, whether it's in the manifest or not. You don't, you're mapping it with real time usage of the tools,

S Speaker 225:07right? We do have that people, okay? What I'm trying to say is, see, this is where you have come in. And, you know, this just landed on our platform. Yeah, I'll show I'll be able to show you the whole workflow. What we do is we start off with the complete unknown. We say, here's the Kubernetes containers. These are the Kubernetes containers that are talking to these llms. These are the containers that are talking to the MCP server. And we start inferring things, and we start so what I'm saying is I am not trusting the manager.
right? We do have that people, okay? What I'm trying to say is, see, this is where you have come in. And, you know, this just landed on our platform.

S Speaker 325:39Exactly. That's what, that's what I was like.
Exactly. That's what, that's what I was like.
Exactly. That's what, that's what I was like.
Exactly. That's what, that's what I was like.
S Speaker 225:43I'm actually looking at things, and when I'm saying based on this communication graph, like, over here, when we, when we started out, if you look at it, here's an unknown, unknown thing, like, what is this guy? Right? And to solve that problem, we have gone into this thing like we observed. So we first observe what is happening in the communication by looking at the wire. I can tell you, this is MCP going on. This is an LLM API. The other guy I can I start inferring and doing the space. And when I say, This is what I have made sense. And the person can literally where we're going with this is they can literally say, Oh no, no, I think you got this wrong. Do this, do this, and then say, lock it down. And by the way, like what I'm showing you over here in manifest. I'll show you it happens over here as well. Here's my discard my changes have definition if I show you. This is the UI version of it, right? So that YAML file says, okay,
I'm actually looking at things, and when I'm saying based on this communication graph, like, over here, when we, when we started out, if you look at it, here's an unknown, unknown thing, like, what is this guy?

26:44so many components, yeah, I have
so many components, yeah, I have
so many components, yeah, I have
so many components, yeah, I have
S Speaker 226:47these components within this component. You know? What are the pods that map to this? What are the policies I want? So let me add some policy on it, and we go very deep into that. What I'm saying is that manifest in the application, we have exposed it because ml, sec ops and platform engineering guys love it. That's how they do their SecOps looks at manifest, Kubernetes, yamls and all that kind of stuff. But what I'm saying is, even when I go into the access side of it, when you look at my access control over here, you will see that my access policies are over here. And we debated a lot, because the consumer of this is the IT security guy, okay, they don't like the yamls, but the underlying of this is a YAML. Is a YAML. And we debated a lot saying, Should we represent policy as good and a bunch of IT security people said, no, no, I want a UI work.
these components within this component. You know? What are the pods that map to this? What are the policies I want? So let me add some policy on it, and we go very deep into that.

S Speaker 327:46I want a UI. No, I get that. I mean, it's ultimately the same thing, but you're representing it differently, right? What I was saying was, maybe, if you were to highlight an alert, if you go to the dashboard, right, if you say that, these are the critical agents. And these agents, whether it's in the YAML or not. In the YAML, you see some abnormal behavior, right? Yeah. Where do you capture it? How do you how do you let the user know, right? So I didn't see that in the dashboard yet. Maybe it's Yeah,
I want a UI. No, I get that. I mean, it's ultimately the same thing, but you're representing it differently, right?

S Speaker 228:18because so first of all, in the dashboards and stuff, we start talking about, like protection and things like that, because we had to have it unified, yeah, and very, very straight up. You know what we have is we have the logs and reports and traces and things like that. That was critical for women. That's
because so first of all, in the dashboards and stuff, we start talking about, like protection and things like that, because we had to have it unified, yeah, and very, very straight up.

S Speaker 328:38more, that's more like observability, like for it sects, let's say a head of IPsec, right? He wants to know today, when I log in, oh, Priyesh had 10 agents running. Two of them went haywire, right? And and what happened there? So I'm saying because you will have the view of what agent is doing every time. You'll have the whole workflow, right? You'll have step by step instruction. You'll have the YAML you can easily pinpoint and say, Hey, today was the first time Priyesh is a sales agent tried to delete a customer record opportunities,

S Speaker 429:16right? So, yeah, so yes, I'm now going to the sausage.
right? So, yeah, so yes, I'm now going to the sausage.
right? So, yeah, so yes, I'm now going to the sausage.
right? So, yeah, so yes, I'm now going to the sausage.
S Speaker 229:21Yes, this is what's coming next week, where we identify threats, what has happened? Which guy has access this? And if you look at it carefully, we're saying only show me breakdowns by agents. Group them by components in the agentic system, by severity or whatever. Tell me what exactly is the problem, right? I mean, this is the agent. This is the component. What exploits have we seen? What is this thing? So what I'm saying is, this is a UI skin on top of the logs that we collect, and we are coming up with a complete workflow, basically, with all the customers that we've had, we understand the importance of threats, and it's coming very soon with policy violations, vulnerabilities, multiple different dimensions of views, right in the agent side. That's what is coming literally within the next two weeks. Got it. But again, you know, ruthless prioritization and stuff.
Yes, this is what's coming next week, where we identify threats, what has happened? Which guy has access this? And if you look at it carefully, we're saying only show me breakdowns by agents.

30:19No, no, I get that?
S Speaker 330:38Got it. Got it. So maybe, I think what, what could be worth discussing? Forget the UI. I think that you can solve for, right? Yeah, mentioned. You have the logs, raw data, yeah. I think how accurate your models are, or your own algorithms, or AI, whatever you're using to truly bubble these things up, right? Because security is all about reducing false positives, right? Everybody has some alerts, but the quality of those alerts matter. So I think I'm not able to bridge the gap between all the steps that you've seen, being able to compare it with the manifest or any abnormal behavior, how you are doing.
Got it. Got it. So maybe, I think what, what could be worth discussing? Forget the UI. I think that you can solve for, right? Yeah, mentioned. You have the logs, raw data, yeah.

S Speaker 231:20How, yeah, how do we reduce false positive? Let's just take a look at it. Okay? What you would agree that every LLM communication has, let's say a prompt injection and jailbreak. And that's what? Yes, the problem is, I might get a false positive on a prompt injection, okay? And at that point, whatever the security platform is on that one transaction I'm saying, I have seen prompt injection, but that prompt injection has no meaning. If it didn't cause any damage, what is the damage? And now I'm going to explain to you. This is security annotated log on every trace. So when I was saying that out of the 10,000 I bubble up the top five, how do I bubble up? How do I bubble up? Is, oh, the user has a direct prompt injection. Simply block it, move it back, right? That's all. But the problem in agent is mal content. At some point I will try to make your LLM do things It shouldn't have. So you actually have this whole behavior over here, step by step that you went to the LLM LLM ask you to take a particular action, and I'm taking that action. This is the first time, I will look at you asked me to summarize a document.

S Speaker 233:20That's exactly what they're going to say. So what, man, nothing really happened here. We give you the critical alerts. Critical to us is critical to us, is privilege escalation. And when I say that you access Google Drive when you were summarizing a document, it's a critical thing. And we have that kind of an incident which basically says, This is what I found. This is what the criticality is. Then we and it's coming shortly. And then what it does is, next to that thing, it will actually draw out. Sorry, I was actually showing you the graphs and stuff. Basically it will, it will take this sub component of this graph, because I already have the behavior, I will redraw the small graph saying, This is what really happened. It went from the user, this is where we detected a potential prompt injection. And it was very detected a privilege escalation. And this is what the problem is. And this is critical. So every This is why we can find needles in the haystack. And of course, some of these things are being built,
That's exactly what they're going to say. So what, man, nothing really happened here. We give you the critical alerts. Critical to us is critical to us, is privilege escalation.

S Speaker 235:08Yeah. I mean, so basically, you know, for example, we put in the whole runtime security and double down on Discovery and inventory. Because what we realized was discovering and inventory is is the bigger thing, like control, like people don't even know what they are running. Now, if you look at my discovery, where we where we are with the discovery in the product, I mean, if I, if I cannot, show it to you, I know about not just what URLs and things you're using. I know about code editor plugins, web browser extensions. I know the complete data connectivity graph. I know about desktop applications that you're using. How is data moving? I know all about that, right, which is why I know what what debug did, and I know what debug typed into Cloud desktop, and what Claude desktop started doing automatically, right? This level of detail people haven't gone through discovery is very rich from that standpoint. So that's why, I mean, you know, I mean, we, we did spend like, 1415, months on on building this. We wanted to get our foundations right.
Yeah. I mean, so basically, you know, for example, we put in the whole runtime security and double down on Discovery and inventory.

S Speaker 336:19And maybe can we see a demo app, but let's use Claude and then try to do something maybe,
And maybe can we see a demo app, but let's use Claude and then try to do something maybe,
And maybe can we see a demo app, but let's use Claude and then try to do something maybe,
And maybe can we see a demo app, but let's use Claude and then try to do something maybe,
40:37yeah, but in terms of, you know,
yeah, but in terms of, you know,
yeah, but in terms of, you know,
yeah, but in terms of, you know,
S Speaker 340:40just still ensuring the experience happens. So let's take another example beyond prompt injection. What would be a good use case that
just still ensuring the experience happens. So let's take another example beyond prompt injection. What would be a good use case that
just still ensuring the experience happens. So let's take another example beyond prompt injection. What would be a good use case that
just still ensuring the experience happens. So let's take another example beyond prompt injection. What would be a good use case that
40:48saving it for? Yeah, yeah.
saving it for? Yeah, yeah.
saving it for? Yeah, yeah.
saving it for? Yeah, yeah.
S Speaker 240:50So last time did I show you a demo of the product?
So last time did I show you a demo of the product?
So last time did I show you a demo of the product?
So last time did I show you a demo of the product?
S Speaker 340:55So we were in the last you know, trying to wrap up the meeting.
So we were in the last you know, trying to wrap up the meeting.
So we were in the last you know, trying to wrap up the meeting.
So we were in the last you know, trying to wrap up the meeting.
S Speaker 241:00It was okay. Let me show you. So here's an example the kind of policies we support. Yeah, you know, content based policies. What I'm showing first HR is uploading a file with SSM, yeah, we're simply going to be able to wipe out the password you want, you want warnings to be given back. Like, I mean, here's a piece of code. It has AWS passwords, it'll come back, and it's actually going to give you a warning saying you're uploading code and it has sensitive information. This message is fully customizable. We recommend this, right? So the workflow for us is, we find the problems, right? And then you can customize this message saying you violating AI safe usage policy. One, dot 2.1, if you proceed, we can redact right. The other thing that we've done is we were working with a chip design company. We were working with a consulting company. The consulting company was super concerned that people are uploading whiteboard itself. So whiteboard images, we have chip designs and things like that. And because we have built all of these models ground up,
It was okay. Let me show you. So here's an example the kind of policies we support. Yeah, you know, content based policies. What I'm showing first HR is uploading a file with SSM, yeah, we're simply going to be able to wipe out the password you want, you want warnings to be given back.

And because we have built all of these models ground up,
42:11we have the know how
S Speaker 242:13to kind of add any kind of image detector, any kind of audio detector.
to kind of add any kind of image detector, any kind of audio detector.
to kind of add any kind of image detector, any kind of audio detector.
to kind of add any kind of image detector, any kind of audio detector.
S Speaker 342:21So in the whiteboard there's like, what I'm trying to get to is there will be still cases where you actually want it to run right based on the intent of the user, right? Let's say, if I want to summarize some medical research, right? But you know, there are two versions of it. One is, this is publicly available. I want it summarized, right? Versus this is my core IP research. I don't want it to be summarized, right? Those are two different intents. What do we do about how do you differentiate? Let's say you are an internal employee, right? You're running two different crops at the same time. Both is summarized research. One is publicly available, one is not. How would you distinguish the intent? In that case,
So in the whiteboard there's like, what I'm trying to get to is there will be still cases where you actually want it to run right based on the intent of the user, right?

How would you distinguish the intent? In that case,
S Speaker 243:08it's not always about the intent, right? I mean, in that case, the intent doesn't matter. But then comes confidentiality, and we have a confidentiality detector. I don't have a policy set up on that right now. But basically what we did was we said What's confidential, and when you look at like numbers, when you look at this thing,
it's not always about the intent, right? I mean, in that case, the intent doesn't matter. But then comes confidentiality, and we have a confidentiality detector. I don't have a policy set up on that right now. But basically what we did was we said What's confidential, and when you look at like numbers, when you look at this thing,

S Speaker 343:30yeah, so the one that we all would, you know agree, we'll have consensus on are easy
yeah, so the one that we all would, you know agree, we'll have consensus on are easy
yeah, so the one that we all would, you know agree, we'll have consensus on are easy
yeah, so the one that we all would, you know agree, we'll have consensus on are easy
S Speaker 245:56Yeah. So I'll tell you how that works in our system. I can burden the companies from that in our system. You just plug it into chat, GPT, 15 of them, and we just put a feedback saying we didn't get it right now, our auto fine tutor kicks in. 24 hours later, we have a much more accurate thing, and we can provide them. We invested a lot of time. See, the point is, if you have, like, a data classification engine, we can do that using API. You have a model, we integrate with APIs, right? But if you're just looking at prompts and things like that, you can just tell me that you didn't
Yeah. So I'll tell you how that works in our system. I can burden the companies from that in our system.

S Speaker 346:38know that I was just giving an example. But yeah, I think I get that.

know that I was just giving an example. But yeah, I think I get that.
S Speaker 246:43Yeah, that's an excellent idea. We don't have it today.

Yeah, that's an excellent idea. We don't have it today.
Yeah, that's an excellent idea. We don't have it today.
S Speaker 346:47Yeah, yeah, no. And then you have a lot of things already. The agent one was, honestly last time you didn't get to cover it's pretty comprehensive. It actually is lot more details. And it's not just for the IT person. It's also for the DevOps or the ones who are building it. Because the whole visual flow, and, you know, being able to see it, it's super interesting.
Yeah, yeah, no. And then you have a lot of things already. The agent one was, honestly last time you didn't get to cover it's pretty comprehensive. It actually is lot more details.

S Speaker 247:12Because the main thing I'll tell you, you know, in my previous company, which is not even now, the reason why Comcast bought it was they were running into a different problem in micro services, they were running into a problem that we build 20 new apps every month and take it to production. It takes some Yes, and we've applied that same thing saying that is what is happening with agents. The security guys don't know. I need to tell them as they can in their language, in their speech,

It takes some Yes, and we've applied that same thing saying that is what is happening with agents. The security guys don't know. I need to tell them as they can in their language, in their speech,
47:45and that's what we have tried to come up with.
and that's what we have tried to come up with.
and that's what we have tried to come up with.
and that's what we have tried to come up with.
S Speaker 247:49So, yeah, no, that's that's super
So, yeah, no, that's that's super

So, yeah, no, that's that's super

S Speaker 349:45right? No. And then I think let us keep us posted on how those discussions go. We are. We haven't made a bet yet, Satya, but we are looking at the space, and, you know, complete transparency, of course, talking to others as well in this space, right? As you would know, multiple companies in this domain. But one thing I was, I mean, the team, you know, has this thing about, what about the big players, right? They're not gonna sit still, even if they have an add on product that, like, let's say, a kid or Pangea. Does that create noise for you guys? Right? The Independent startups to win a palo alto network sales guy shows up and claims all those things. It might not work as the product might not be. You know, it's a bolt on product. It's not fully fleshed out. How do you see that? Do you see that as a threat, or it's just nice,
right? No. And then I think let us keep us posted on how those discussions go. We are.

S Speaker 250:39and I'll tell you why. Yeah. The thing is, when you're building a company, yeah, I need to be first very confident about what we are building, and get feedback from the customers. You absolutely must look at every competitor and see, did I miss something? Is there a cool feature that I can just very quickly add that's blocking my sale? Right? Have confidence in that. Now, this is a big market. Everybody's going to bet on it. That just tells you it's validation, yeah, have the confidence from that perspective. And we are kind of going in that route, okay? Now, when Priyesh asked me this, I told you I be 100% that. Ai security, the access security piece that I'm actually showing you. What is my thought process behind it? My thought process is, I have to be the best at AI security. I have Z scaler and Palo Alto, sassy and netscope are the incumbents. I have to go in their backyard, yeah? Will 10% of their customer that better than them in AI? Yeah? And my belief is the sassy market is a very well established market. Of course, you ask me my thought process the minute you get to the 1500 million kind of a thing, or maybe much earlier. That's when I need to punch about my weight category, and I'm building for that. Why? Because Priyesh asked me, like, how will you support 15,000 of these using AI? These people use AI application.
and I'll tell you why. Yeah. The thing is, when you're building a company, yeah, I need to be first very confident about what we are building, and get feedback from the customers.

S Speaker 352:14You'll reinvent the net scopes and the Z scale, right? It'll be aI first networking or AI for security, right? So

You'll reinvent the net scopes and the Z scale, right? It'll be aI first networking or AI for security, right? So
S Speaker 252:23if I just look at AI security, yeah, it's going to be a good market, yeah. But in the long term, there is not going to be a rescaler and an activity in a big customer, because it creates operational challenges, right, right? And I have to be prepared to punch about the weight category. Now, if we say I'm the best at AI. They can't do what I can do. I can do what they can. They can. Yes, yes. I mean, that's what reinvention is.

S Speaker 352:47That's exactly what I was hinting towards. The bigger vision is to become that layer which where they don't need the Z scalers and escorts. That's what net scope did, right? They went in the CASB and access, and then they grew into another networking giant, right? So this is great Satyam, actually, I wanted to see if you would be open to connecting with my team. Now we can switch meeting. You know, a lot of it would be repeat for you, so I apologize, but I think for my team it will be good to, you know, get, get it straight from you, versus us as educating them. If you're open. I mean, I'll,

S Speaker 253:40Completely understand, you know, the for me, one of the most important thing, is that, you know, it's not just about technically, what we are building, but getting a buy in from the customers and the analysts and investors from that I will ask you one question. You guys have been looking at this area very deeply. Have you looked at the Gartner's latest stuff?

S Speaker 354:04So I will be honest about the Gartner stuff, right? I think we, I don't personally put a lot of weight on the Gartner stuff. I get the trends that they see. I completely I'm not. I'm not. I would rather go and talk to five customers myself and try to extrapolate some things, right? I get what, where you're coming from. I'm just telling you where I where I try to be a little independent and try to form my views. But anything, anything that you're guiding towards as

S Speaker 254:41you were trying to do, yes, and I'll tell you why, yeah. The thing is, we started the company in 2024 Yeah, how we have come up with this platform and things like that is with customer discussions and what we thought. Because I build rags, I train models, I saw these problems first hand, and that's when we experienced it. Yeah, and I'm going to show you like we didn't build what Gartner was asking for. But I'm pleasantly surprised.

S Speaker 356:03you know, on Satyam, I think I'll tell you the two things they're talking about. We had that same kind of chart, you know, but maybe the nomenclature and some of the features are more and gardeners, they have this whole lingo and, you know, buzzwords, but, but we had the same bifurcation, right? So I'm saying we independently arrived at it. That's why I'm trying to say we have done more firsthand work, yeah, and then just, you know, relying on some third party. But I take your point. I see a lot of that in your platform already, so, but kudos to you on, you know, being, being, being up with the market and, and, you know, getting a product out. So let's, let's do this. Priyesh and I will follow up on what kind of word. This is, not like, like an IC meeting of prep, per se, but this is more to Hey, you guys are fundraising. You know, we know about this place. Let's learn more and and see where it goes from there, right? So I just want to set the context, but I really appreciate you sharing.

So then maybe if you have something on the pipeline and the usage, the type case or use case of some of the current customers, because you the product seems very deep into agentic security.
