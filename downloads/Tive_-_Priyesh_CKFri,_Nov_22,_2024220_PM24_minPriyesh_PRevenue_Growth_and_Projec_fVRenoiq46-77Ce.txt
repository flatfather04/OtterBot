where's our top line go? So,
S Speaker 20:06yes, they say they've dated about 50% 53% year on year. Growth in 2457 next year, 48 and 43

S Speaker 10:29I always thought about these guys as a 50 60% growth rate. From 23 to 24 they grew 54% but from 22 to 23 they only grew 49% Yeah, okay, all right, so this is sort of in line with past growth, not maybe next year grows more, okay. And then what is your your view of how they grow?

S Speaker 21:00So made three cases here, Carlos,
So made three cases here, Carlos,
So made three cases here, Carlos,
So made three cases here, Carlos,
1:05it's in here. Let me
S Speaker 21:09if you're able to see it better. So I've assumed three cases. I haven't cut down the numbers on the total revenue, total gross margin figure. Rather, I have taken an understanding of their one time business, subscription business, and did some discounting on those numbers, and then eventually they weigh down to give us the overall revenue growth and gross margins in the optimistic case management says their one Time revenue will grow in this fashion. So that's effectively a 50% year on year growth, but slows down in 2627 given that the product is getting commoditized, I think optimistically, we should be following that case, but I've still given a 10% haircut on one time revenue growth.

2:00Yeah. I mean, look,
S Speaker 12:03a one time revenue line is what's been carrying the business,
a one time revenue line is what's been carrying the business,
a one time revenue line is what's been carrying the business,
a one time revenue line is what's been carrying the business,
S Speaker 12:07least sexy. Yeah, right, yeah. So, you know, realistically they they need to the platform dollars. Need to be good. What's their mix of platform dollars next year After following year,

So this year you say, 2425
S Speaker 23:10this year, 24 it was 17. In fact, last year was it was 17 again, okay, fraction the year before and time, revenue
this year, 24 it was 17. In fact, last year was it was 17 again, okay, fraction the year before and time, revenue

3:30was closer to 80%
3:33decreases to about 67
decreases to about 67
decreases to about 67
decreases to about 67
3:41sorry, it grows to how much from 17 to how
sorry, it grows to how much from 17 to how
sorry, it grows to how much from 17 to how
sorry, it grows to how much from 17 to how
S Speaker 23:44much. Subscription grows from 17 to 30 and one time. Revenue goes from 80 today to 6767 68 so, so,

S Speaker 13:58so. There's a line of

4:04multi use revenue. How big is that? What
multi use revenue. How big is that? What

4:08do you mean by multi use? Sorry,
do you mean by multi use? Sorry,
do you mean by multi use? Sorry,
do you mean by multi use? Sorry,
S Speaker 24:14customers the multi use part one cycle to use. Yeah, once. Okay, so they've categorized multi use within subscription, and if I just do multi use,
customers the multi use part one cycle to use. Yeah, once. Okay, so they've categorized multi use within subscription, and if I just do multi use,
customers the multi use part one cycle to use. Yeah, once. Okay, so they've categorized multi use within subscription, and if I just do multi use,
customers the multi use part one cycle to use. Yeah, once. Okay, so they've categorized multi use within subscription, and if I just do multi use,
S Speaker 24:32that's 12 and a half today goes to 17, one, seven.
that's 12 and a half today goes to 17, one, seven.
that's 12 and a half today goes to 17, one, seven.
that's 12 and a half today goes to 17, one, seven.
S Speaker 14:38So something is wrong, because you got 17 for multi use, you got 80 something for single use, and then 30 for platform. That's more than 100.
So something is wrong, because you got 17 for multi use, you got 80 something for single use, and then 30 for platform. That's more than 100.
So something is wrong, because you got 17 for multi use, you got 80 something for single use, and then 30 for platform. That's more than 100.
So something is wrong, because you got 17 for multi use, you got 80 something for single use, and then 30 for platform. That's more than 100.
S Speaker 24:50So subscription, yeah, when I when I say platform, Carlos, that's multi use plus the platform. So, okay, got it, and they've put both of them together into the subscription revenue, broader bucket. Oh,
So subscription, yeah, when I when I say platform, Carlos, that's multi use plus the platform. So, okay, got it, and they've put both of them together into the subscription revenue, broader bucket. Oh,
So subscription, yeah, when I when I say platform, Carlos, that's multi use plus the platform. So, okay, got it, and they've put both of them together into the subscription revenue, broader bucket. Oh,

S Speaker 15:04I understood. Okay, interesting, that that's how they do it. Okay, all right, so their top line gets to 100 this year. Will be sorry, go back. So 24 will be 4544
I understood. Okay, interesting, that that's how they do it. Okay, all right, so their top line gets to 100 this year. Will be sorry, go back. So 24 will be 4544

then 103, and then whatever.
S Speaker 15:33And your numbers, what's what's your number in 27
And your numbers, what's what's your number in 27
And your numbers, what's what's your number in 27
And your numbers, what's what's your number in 27
S Speaker 25:38so my number three cases. Optimistically, I would say
so my number three cases. Optimistically, I would say
so my number three cases. Optimistically, I would say
so my number three cases. Optimistically, I would say
S Speaker 25:48131 122 and 102
5:53okay? Are the three cases I built.
okay? Are the three cases I built.
okay? Are the three cases I built.
okay? Are the three cases I built.
S Speaker 15:58Okay, so if I took their business today, 44 let's see 44 and I say it grows at 50%
Okay, so if I took their business today, 44 let's see 44 and I say it grows at 50%
Okay, so if I took their business today, 44 let's see 44 and I say it grows at 50%
Okay, so if I took their business today, 44 let's see 44 and I say it grows at 50%
S Speaker 16:13That's that this lambda, that that's 148 that's the 148
That's that this lambda, that that's 148 that's the 148
That's that this lambda, that that's 148 that's the 148
That's that this lambda, that that's 148 that's the 148
6:19and if we do 122, enter 44 divide, then I do
and if we do 122, enter 44 divide, then I do
and if we do 122, enter 44 divide, then I do
and if we do 122, enter 44 divide, then I do
S Speaker 16:30three, one over x, then I do this to that 40% so between 40, you say They grow 40, they say they grow at 50,
three, one over x, then I do this to that 40% so between 40, you say They grow 40, they say they grow at 50,
three, one over x, then I do this to that 40% so between 40, you say They grow 40, they say they grow at 50,
three, one over x, then I do this to that 40% so between 40, you say They grow 40, they say they grow at 50,
6:45I think in general, I'm fine with your midpoint. I
I think in general, I'm fine with your midpoint. I
I think in general, I'm fine with your midpoint. I
I think in general, I'm fine with your midpoint. I
6:47think it's my senses. I
think it's my senses. I
think it's my senses. I
think it's my senses. I
S Speaker 16:51I don't see why the business would slow down. Okay. My point is, I think we have a baseline business that's been growing. We have the software, which is early, but the blueprint looks good. I think it will be choppy for the next couple of quarters, until they figure out pricing and etc. But, you know, I think it's good. It feels like the bookies machine and the sales conversion machine has improved. So it feels okay. It feels like and then with more money, they should be able to, you know, raising. They're going to raise 40. They're going to raise 40, right? So with 40, they should be able to, you know, make some if they're not stupid. And that was a discussion in the last board meeting. Was basically, you raise the money, but you keep running frugal. You don't you. This is not a blank check for you to start the stupid shit. Yeah, right. They should be able to figure out how to run a how to build a solid business. Okay, so let's say they get to 122, what multi port we're looking for action,
I don't see why the business would slow down. Okay. My point is, I think we have a baseline business that's been growing. We have the software, which is early, but the blueprint looks good.

S Speaker 28:01I have chosen 6x that is what we did for our stage two as well. Couldn't find a lot of very close comparables here, Carlos, so I can do a deeper research there,
I have chosen 6x that is what we did for our stage two as well. Couldn't find a lot of very close comparables here, Carlos, so I can do a deeper research there,

I have chosen 6x that is what we did for our stage two as well. Couldn't find a lot of very close comparables here, Carlos, so I can do a deeper research there,
S Speaker 18:17a few decades older than you are. I can't read these numbers.
a few decades older than you are. I can't read these numbers.
a few decades older than you are. I can't read these numbers.
a few decades older than you are. I can't read these numbers.
8:26I just use a monitor in your source.
I just use a monitor in your source.
I just use a monitor in your source.
I just use a monitor in your source.
S Speaker 28:31Yeah, every time I do this with he has the same point I have to learn. Okay, good.
Yeah, every time I do this with he has the same point I have to learn. Okay, good.
Yeah, every time I do this with he has the same point I have to learn. Okay, good.
Yeah, every time I do this with he has the same point I have to learn. Okay, good.
8:38All right, so, so,
S Speaker 18:41all right, somehow you need to scroll a little bit further, because you don't have the full column B and column A, something is off centered, or maybe it's on my end. Yeah, it is on my end. Okay, good. I got it. Okay, this is good, yeah. All right, so you say an exit of 730 is the midpoint for inter
all right, somehow you need to scroll a little bit further, because you don't have the full column B and column A, something is off centered, or maybe it's on my end. Yeah, it is on my end. Okay, good. I got it. Okay, this is good, yeah. All right, so you say an exit of 730 is the midpoint for inter

and on the new dollars, not the total on the new dollars.
and on the new dollars, not the total on the new dollars.
S Speaker 29:16Oh, this is, this is the total return, yeah. But you
Oh, this is, this is the total return, yeah. But you
Oh, this is, this is the total return, yeah. But you
Oh, this is, this is the total return, yeah. But you
S Speaker 19:21always have to look at the new dollars. Okay, yeah, yeah, right, yeah. This is every investment decisions, a new decision, yeah, unless there's a pay to play,
always have to look at the new dollars. Okay, yeah, yeah, right, yeah. This is every investment decisions, a new decision, yeah, unless there's a pay to play,

9:31of course, then you have to protect,
of course, then you have to protect,
of course, then you have to protect,
of course, then you have to protect,
S Speaker 19:32you know, yeah. Okay, so, so it's two point X overall, and this would yield the proceeds of 15, which is okay, not bad for when we started. But, yeah, we obviously aim for hire. So, but on the new dollars, it's really, it's really gonna be, oh, it's easy, right? What are you What are you thinking of exit buys these guys?
you know, yeah. Okay, so, so it's two point X overall, and this would yield the proceeds of 15, which is okay, not bad for when we started. But, yeah, we obviously aim for hire. So, but on the new dollars, it's really, it's really gonna be, oh, it's easy, right? What are you What are you thinking of exit buys these guys?

S Speaker 210:02So I haven't. I have thought of, okay, thought of an m&a rather than an IPO. I think add 120 sort of revenue figure, there'd be more of an acquisition target, maybe a p, but to
So I haven't. I have thought of, okay, thought of an m&a rather than an IPO. I think add 120 sort of revenue figure, there'd be more of an acquisition target, maybe a p, but to
So I haven't. I have thought of, okay, thought of an m&a rather than an IPO. I think add 120 sort of revenue figure, there'd be more of an acquisition target, maybe a p, but to
So I haven't. I have thought of, okay, thought of an m&a rather than an IPO. I think add 120 sort of revenue figure, there'd be more of an acquisition target, maybe a p, but to
10:21get an acquisition target right, they
get an acquisition target right, they
get an acquisition target right, they
get an acquisition target right, they
S Speaker 110:23need to be okay, so they're 100 million, and then they need to have a gross margin that looks like 60, and they need to grow like 4050, right? If not, you don't, it's probably hard to Exit,
need to be okay, so they're 100 million, and then they need to have a gross margin that looks like 60, and they need to grow like 4050, right? If not, you don't, it's probably hard to Exit,
need to be okay, so they're 100 million, and then they need to have a gross margin that looks like 60, and they need to grow like 4050, right? If not, you don't, it's probably hard to Exit,
need to be okay, so they're 100 million, and then they need to have a gross margin that looks like 60, and they need to grow like 4050, right? If not, you don't, it's probably hard to Exit,
10:35Exit decently, yeah.
S Speaker 210:41I think the growth would still be there. Carlos, I'm a bit more concerned about the gross margins. Okay,
I think the growth would still be there. Carlos, I'm a bit more concerned about the gross margins. Okay,
I think the growth would still be there. Carlos, I'm a bit more concerned about the gross margins. Okay,
I think the growth would still be there. Carlos, I'm a bit more concerned about the gross margins. Okay,
10:50they'll get to 60. So
they'll get to 60. So
they'll get to 60. So
they'll get to 60. So
10:52optimum in the optimistic case, I think
optimum in the optimistic case, I think
optimum in the optimistic case, I think
optimum in the optimistic case, I think
10:56the gross margins go to 56
the gross margins go to 56
the gross margins go to 56
the gross margins go to 56
11:01base case, I would say 53 kind of thing. Okay, yeah, that
base case, I would say 53 kind of thing. Okay, yeah, that
base case, I would say 53 kind of thing. Okay, yeah, that
base case, I would say 53 kind of thing. Okay, yeah, that
11:05that's not good. All right. So, okay, let's
that's not good. All right. So, okay, let's
that's not good. All right. So, okay, let's
that's not good. All right. So, okay, let's
S Speaker 111:08do this. Let's assume, again, the exit is 730 This is 320 so it's, it's like two point something from here. Yeah, right, yeah. So, and that's three years out, so that's and there's no further, no further round, right?
do this. Let's assume, again, the exit is 730 This is 320 so it's, it's like two point something from here. Yeah, right, yeah. So, and that's three years out, so that's and there's no further, no further round, right?

S Speaker 211:28In the most conservative case, there might be one round for but for the optimistic base case, there is no further round.

S Speaker 212:38I can, I can probably spend, let's say, a minute Carlos and taking you through some of the assumptions I've done for all of these cases. And I think that would give us a better idea. I cannot, with 100% conviction, say today where the business would go, because I don't have that good a feel about the entire space right now. So I think there's probably value in just spending a minute here, just going through my assumptions. All right, so what I've done is for in all of the three cases, I have said that the gross margins for their one time revenue product would be at 40% the project, it will be growing from 34 today to 47.8 in 2027 I don't think that's possible. I think the product is a little bit too commoditized. The market is crowded, so I've kept it at 40

S Speaker 213:44Subscription revenue, which is a platform plus multi use, I've given a 20% discount on management predictions for optimistic, 30% discount for base and 40% discount on the conservative case. I have also modeled in a 10% churn in subscription and platform revenue in 2025 for the base case, and 15% churn in 2025 for conservative case. That's because they're changing their pricing tiers, and I think there might be some churn that you also mentioned. Hey, I'm a little

S Speaker 115:21so I think the best way to do this, or maybe a proxy, to do this, this year, he said he was going to reach 50, yeah. And in the end, he's going to do 44 right? Yeah. So that's 12% not 12 is more than 12, that's 12% off. Okay? And then And then,

15:53last year was a big mess,
last year was a big mess,
last year was a big mess,
last year was a big mess,
S Speaker 115:56because last year he actually said he was going to do 50 early in the year, and then he did whatever third, okay, yeah, I would discount 15 to 20, I think is what I would do for next year.

S Speaker 116:43Great question. Here's the churn I would like to see. I would like to see these guys fire all these small accounts. They have numerous small accounts doing 40,000 ACV, whatever. It's just a pain, right? They don't have the discipline. Don't have the discipline to sort of do that, but that's what they should do, because there's when you think about the support costs and whatever, right? It's like the economics for those accounts just, I think, are just bad. Okay, all right.

S Speaker 217:19Okay. One thing, yeah, one thing. Carlos, I saw their gross margin for this subscription business suddenly improved by 80% in 2024, and they say the gross margins would improve from current nine, from 20, 72.5 to 90% do you think that's a valid case? I have kept it at 80% for our base case.

S Speaker 117:54I mean, the platform is software, yeah, multi use tracker is not software, but it's basically the idea that you sell that software, that hardware once, and you can multiple monetize it multiple times. Yeah, right. So on the single use, the gross margin has improved because of the recycle program. They're basically making it easy for you to send it back to refurbish Center, where they clean it up with a new battery, blah, blah, and then they don't have to manufacture a new

S Speaker 219:00One thing on sales and marketing expense, OpEx. This is how they as a percentage of revenue. This is how much OPEX they have been spending. 2024 it was 35 they say it will, it will. It's on a downward trend from here goes down to 23 Yeah. Okay,
One thing on sales and marketing expense, OpEx. This is how they as a percentage of revenue. This is how much OPEX they have been spending. 2024 it was 35 they say it will, it will. It's on a downward trend from here goes down to 23 Yeah. Okay,

S Speaker 119:26yeah, it's this year was flat. The burden was flat from last year, right? 40 million. 40 million the year before, again, they have been better at be more efficient. With the new money, they'll probably grow sales, I think that's that's a good area to grow. There's been pushback over the years on R and D, you're investing these dollars in R D, and we don't see the product differentiation, and we don't see pricing power, right? R and yeah. So that one, that one is one where, hopefully this is just the percent of revenue, right? I don't know what the absolute number is, but the absolute number hopefully doesn't skyrocket. Okay, so All right, so, so here's my view. Um,
yeah, it's this year was flat. The burden was flat from last year, right? 40 million. 40 million the year before, again, they have been better at be more efficient.

20:18yeah, it does not. I would feel
yeah, it does not. I would feel
yeah, it does not. I would feel
yeah, it does not. I would feel
S Speaker 120:20more comfortable if we have visibility 3x from here, because basically our mid case has 2x Yeah, I would say, Let's do 500k
more comfortable if we have visibility 3x from here, because basically our mid case has 2x Yeah, I would say, Let's do 500k
more comfortable if we have visibility 3x from here, because basically our mid case has 2x Yeah, I would say, Let's do 500k
more comfortable if we have visibility 3x from here, because basically our mid case has 2x Yeah, I would say, Let's do 500k
20:33and, you know, call it the day
and, you know, call it the day
and, you know, call it the day
and, you know, call it the day
S Speaker 120:37we put some money, we show support. But you know, again, ultimately, it doesn't make a big difference five or 800 but, but basically, it could go either way, yeah, but because, again, you know, we don't have much visibility to 3x and because things tend to go this one again, like right now, really nice guy, really good board, but I don't get the sense that we have something terribly unique here. There's multiple board meetings that we ask the question, right? Why can't we charge more? Why can't we do this? Why can't whatever? And so ultimately, you know, contrast to, if I feel that they have done better than the competition, it's a newer market. Their product is differentiated, and they have, they have a credible path going forward for growth this one, I think the growth will be there because the market's there, but I just don't think they'll have like, yeah, I don't have strong subsidy to say yes, the gross margin will improve substantially, and yes, the
we put some money, we show support. But you know, again, ultimately, it doesn't make a big difference five or 800 but, but basically, it could go either way, yeah, but because, again, you know, we don't have much visibility to 3x and because things tend to go this one again, like right now, really nice guy, really good board, but I don't get the sense that we have something terribly unique here.

There's multiple board meetings that we ask the question, right? Why can't we charge more? Why can't we do this? Why can't whatever? And so ultimately, you know, contrast to, if I feel that they have done better than the competition, it's a newer market.
