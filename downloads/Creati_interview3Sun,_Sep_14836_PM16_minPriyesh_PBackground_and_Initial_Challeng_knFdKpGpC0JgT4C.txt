I don't know if you've seen the website, but I use the AI virtual models. They are very, very good. And even now, one thing that Priyesh has added that's very, very good is the templates, so that, for example, you could have a certain street like, you have a background that looks really good, and then you make a video based off of that, and then you put your your your uploading there. And people, so some people don't even realize it's AI, do

S Speaker 16:22you? Do you use creating? Like, how many videos do you create within a week or a month,
you? Do you use creating? Like, how many videos do you create within a week or a month,
you? Do you use creating? Like, how many videos do you create within a week or a month,
you? Do you use creating? Like, how many videos do you create within a week or a month,
S Speaker 26:28every month, right now, we make about 30 videos on creating. Yes, we make like, 90% of the videos we use are from creating.

S Speaker 16:40Okay, so how are the remaining 10%
Okay, so how are the remaining 10%
Okay, so how are the remaining 10%
Okay, so how are the remaining 10%
S Speaker 26:44the remaining, the remaining 10% is from, is from me, and also from doing image ads. But like on the ads that I make, 90% are from crazy because I'm able to, I don't want to rely, to only rely on AI, right? But if AI can do the job for me, that's good. But I also want a human touch. So then, because I want a human touch, that that's why, like, you know, I tend to also have my own video shooting, especially now, since I have more money to spare. And another good thing is my suppliers also, most of the time, give me the image, the image that and the images that I need. They give me the pictures of the coats the models are Derrida. You have models that are wearing those. So that's also one thing that has changed the game for me. So that's where the remain. 10% is bad, but the other 90% videos, I use crazy for that.

S Speaker 28:06Yeah, we do use security. Is only for AI, but when we do when, for example, if we're doing our own videos, we use other apps, right? For example, the other 10% if we're making videos, we can use other apps. For example, there's this one app that we use to edit it, so we call it photo room. So we use Photo rooms to edit images, right? But then anything, that's the 90% of videos we only use trendy, and we don't usually have to add any touch on it, because it's already good, all right. So maybe one thing we could add is maybe, like, shorten the video or add a little touch, but the outcome on crazy is always clean. You directly

S Speaker 29:15different Yes, so I've tried, I've tried other softwares, and created is way more advanced in my opinion. For example, when you're done creating a video with creating you can directly post it on your ads manager and and it's so quick, so that creative has this option where, when you create a video, right, yeah, it goes directly to the ads manager, and then you can directly include it in your ads so that's one thing that other others have seen do not really have. And there, it can be very costly as well, right? It can be very costly as well. I tried, so I tried runway, and I wasn't pleased, because you're spending the money. But it doesn't really have, you know? Everything that pretty has. And also, one thing I also look for is consistency. I look for consistency in my AI, for example, I would use Sora, maybe, like, one out of six videos can be good. Sometimes it's two out of six videos that can be good and you have to restart, and it can take also some time, right? But in pretty is faster and it's more consistent.

And when I when I stumbled onto crazy, pretty was already good for me, right? So then, if it's doing the job for me and one of the two others,

But then that's the only thing at the end of the day, I'm still saving time, because pandemic shooting takes way longer than you know, maybe waiting 10 moments then you usually wait for for the video to be generated.

S Speaker 112:10Okay, okay, let's see. So do you think the previous pricing model is, do you think it's expensive, or you think is fairly priced? I think,

Okay, okay, let's see. So do you think the previous pricing model is, do you think it's expensive, or you think is fairly priced? I think,
S Speaker 212:22I think for what it can do, it's not expensive enough. I'm actually quite surprised by the price. Since it costs just $40 per year for the annual package, I'm surprised. I expected it to cost way more, right? Usually, like a eyes like this, that are this good, will cost about 120 per year, and this is $40 per year, so I'm going to use it as much as I can right before it gets even more famous and it might even become more expensive, because it's really, really good. Honestly, I'm very satisfied with the price and what it can do.
