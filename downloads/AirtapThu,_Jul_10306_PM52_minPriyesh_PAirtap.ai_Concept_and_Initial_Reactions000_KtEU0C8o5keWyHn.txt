S Speaker 10:04as a virtual, mobile use, right for agent ticket AI. So Rosen put together this idea and put together some, I'll say, some demo products, prototypes, and it's quite fascinating. So Rosen has been talking to a few investors, including Mayfield, I think what's the Aaron Rosen you talk to?

S Speaker 25:42So, on my phone, you know, it's just app or website, and that's the interface. So, you know, I just like any of the other interfaces, so I'm telling it to use Starbucks app and order coffee in Los cados. And so it figures out what it should do. And then, so now it's showing you the cloud, you know, the phone in the cloud. So it has opened the Starbucks app, you know, basically tapping and clicking like I do, you know. So I normally get a cafe latte, and you know, so the next to the Instagram so I just started I follow NCP, like, what did NCP post? And same thing, it took the Instagram app, you know, and then figures out

S Speaker 26:45So, so one thing is that the breadth is very big for softball. So now my common thing is, you know, who's showing us for the tournament, or when are my teams? So this is a small lab which all the softball tournaments use here, called Tony. You know? I mean, the important thing is that we didn't really train it specifically on any of these apps. So, you know, it kind of figures out when they were playing these

S Speaker 37:38Okay, but let's say I have a Starbucks app. Right when I say, Hey, Otter me a Starbucks, whatever it it goes into this Starbucks website.

7:52yeah, but this is something I have to

all the stuff I'm reading and stuff like that. So

all the stuff I'm reading and stuff like that. So
S Speaker 28:43what it supposed to do. So when I think, like, completely separate phone, and then you have a phone in the cloud, and then here's another type of task, which is, you know, the image task. So you can, of course, give it an image, you know. So, like, this is in India, so you're ordering it just is ordered from it basket, so it processes the image and does the normal to add it to the card and order. So the app,
what it supposed to do. So when I think, like, completely separate phone, and then you have a phone in the cloud, and then here's another type of task, which is, you know, the image task.

S Speaker 29:31good phone in the cloud which is completely operated by AI. So that's why, you know, it's actually in reality, also simulating swipes and taps and all that. It's, you know, the app is being used by your person. Yeah. And

9:49then, how do you monetize in this thing, discharge user?
then, how do you monetize in this thing, discharge user?
then, how do you monetize in this thing, discharge user?
then, how do you monetize in this thing, discharge user?
S Speaker 29:51We have some very clever ways to monetize this. So I think the premise is that it'd be simple, that everybody's going to have some AI device. And I think the AI device has to live with the cloud so it can connect to all modalities. And we have found out, you know, from using this thing over the past few months, that actually mobile is one of the best form factors you could have for this device. So there are other people have been trying to do this. So if you look at what's really hard, it's one is coverage rate. So what range of tasks can be executed? Like I showed you, Starbucks, Instagram, some coaching app, you know, food ordering app, health app, so that's quite a wide gamut. So basically, what's the coverage it can, you know, user interaction. So as we use this one, it's very clear that you need human input, like if you just don't want it to go order stuff, you know, especially in the last step. And so I'm convinced that no API based system is going to work for this piece, because, you know, when you need human input, you have to show some interface to the human, which is very familiar. The human, completely new interface doesn't work. And the third is success and accuracy. So like we, you know, the mobile makes it way more accurate. And last is privacy and safety. So if you look at this approach of doing this so coverage, because air tap into anything that can be done on the phone, it actually off the schedule, huge amount of stuff. And here we have found that mobile is big advantage, because for every app, because there are, you know, 5 billion people to

S Speaker 213:33So I think mostly state of the art is, like, even if you look at Manas, they mostly do research kind of stuff they are not doing, like, Go, order me coffee and go, you know, do all this stuff out there. And, you know, so from a coverage perspective, this is very, very broad already. Like, it's broader than you know, we can imagine. And you know, then I also talked to like Samson, and they are saying, Oh, we are building this using API. And this API is running on your phone, is not going to work because, you know, sometimes it takes tasks are longer. They run for 20 minutes, 30 minutes, or even, you know, you have to go back periodically and do it. And then, if you look at like the open AI cloud kind of people. They have mostly PC browser focus, like today, they launch of the browsers, you know. Again, more from search, research kind of perspective, not really execution, right, you know. So they are, I mean, they're far away from this paradigm. So I think that way. And actually, Albert's insight into this is correct that you can plug this into Siri, or you can plug this into Alexa, and they will become really useful. But I don't think we want to go to them now. We want to go to them after we have, like, a million users, or something like that.
So I think mostly state of the art is, like, even if you look at Manas, they mostly do research kind of stuff they are not doing, like, Go, order me coffee and go, you know, do all this stuff out there.

So I just tell it I want to order Starbucks or just download
So I just tell it I want to order Starbucks or just download
S Speaker 215:29this app, yeah. So the first time it will have to it may ask you to log in.
this app, yeah. So the first time it will have to it may ask you to log in.
this app, yeah. So the first time it will have to it may ask you to log in.
this app, yeah. So the first time it will have to it may ask you to log in.
S Speaker 315:34Oh, yeah. The first time I have to log in, so as if I log into Starbucks on another phone. Nice,
Oh, yeah. The first time I have to log in, so as if I log into Starbucks on another phone. Nice,

Oh, yeah. The first time I have to log in, so as if I log into Starbucks on another phone. Nice,
S Speaker 215:42yeah. And then, you know, I was telling Albert, like in Japan, Rakuten is very interested in reloading it so they reload it on the phone. Then, you know, the apps on your phone so it might, you know, sync it automatically and things like that as we get more mature,
yeah. And then, you know, I was telling Albert, like in Japan, Rakuten is very interested in reloading it so they reload it on the phone. Then, you know, the apps on your phone so it might, you know, sync it automatically and things like that as we get more mature,

S Speaker 315:58But otherwise, the user have to go say, if I, if I say, hey, assuming there's nothing there the first time around, they have the download the Starbucks app, right? Yeah. And then,
But otherwise, the user have to go say, if I, if I say, hey, assuming there's nothing there the first time around, they have the download the Starbucks app, right? Yeah. And then,

But otherwise, the user have to go say, if I, if I say, hey, assuming there's nothing there the first time around, they have the download the Starbucks app, right? Yeah. And then,
S Speaker 216:12I mean, we, from a user perspective, we won't show all this, what it's doing in the background, unless it's really needed, right? So it just happens, you don't even know. So
I mean, we, from a user perspective, we won't show all this, what it's doing in the background, unless it's really needed, right? So it just happens, you don't even know. So

S Speaker 216:27No, that's our own. OS, right? So it doesn't matter. We control everything, okay? So, like, if you actually the,

S Speaker 216:39if you, if I look here, you know, the air tap OS, this laptop container, we have actually put a lot of books in it, not just from app install. This stuff is easy, but you know when this, sorry, when this runtime loop works. So actually we have more hooks in it, because otherwise, if you look at you know, you have to look at the screen, understand what's on the screen, right? So most people use some vision grounding model, but here, because we control the OS, we know how the screen is composed, right? So we actually use a lot of the layout and composition information to do that. So installing the app etc is, you know, very straightforward. So when this one, you know, the deck that container tech we had built for gaming, so that is very, very scalable. And, you know, in operate life for two years, three years. So, but because it could run games, it can run any other app.

You know, it has like several 100,000 DAU, so over, you know, million. Mau, global. And then about a year ago, we began working on the AI thing. And then, you know, so we use the same stack, and technology is very mature, but then we added a lot of hooks into it

S Speaker 418:46And Rosen, you mentioned that you don't use a computer vision VLM based technology to make sense of the screen. Most of the computer use company or browser use company that I have met they either use a VLM based technology or have an HTML based technology to make sense of the screen that they're seeing.

S Speaker 119:28Background for Priyesh is so. So this one has a has a operating system. Mobile operating system is actually enjoy operating system running in the cloud. This control by air tap itself, right? So as you think about vision, language model, it's at the very, very up here of the interaction layer, right? Then come down. You may have API, MCP and all that, right? But then at the updating system level, no one else have that access, right, other than air tap. So that's actually you can you can stack all of these interaction channels together, but whenever there's possibility this will take advantage of the lower level of communication.

S Speaker 220:30And actually it goes back to what Quinn said. So let me bring up this, because monetization is very key, right? So this is where the cost so this is, you know, so unoptimized cost, like when we started, it's about 47 cents for one user request, right? And then we are now down below 20 cents, and we think we can bring it to five cents per user request. And this is very key. So when whatever they were saying that from a business forum perspective. So I want it free for consumer, because once you get all consumer, like, once you log in and set up even few apps, you are hooked,
And actually it goes back to what Quinn said. So let me bring up this, because monetization is very key, right?

right? Switching call becomes very high.
S Speaker 221:16So of course, we can do subscription because, you know, people want to be for AI apps and this and that for and you know, for people who are going to use it a lot, subscription is good, but at scale, the we can do same monetization that Google does. And there is so much IP here, you know, so, because think about it. So I am so air tap agent is doing bookings for you, ordering Starbucks for you. This that, of course, if I am booking a hotel and Marriott has an ad, I want the agent to consult, because I may get a better deal to book the hotel. But such a thing does not exist because nobody is in the execution part today. So, but we have lot of experience on the ad side, because that's how we monetize on the gaming cloud, right? So we have also built an ad server which can ingest ads from Google and present it to the agent, right? So while it's doing the booking, so you can think of ads or offers or this and that. So at scale, so at if we can bring the cost down to five cents, actually, it becomes profitable in the US right away, because the US, the CPC that you can get, like for hotel booking, is almost one to $2 per click, right? And so also this area, you know, has so many, so many patterns, because people have not figured this out yet, right? So, I mean, the way I think about is Google owned intent for decades. This is opportunity for us to own intent. If you can own user intent, you are done. Everything else happens. So yes, we can charge subscription, but I think at scale, the Google's ad based monetization for agents works really well, right? But, you know, subscription easier, because it brings you revenue first and then, but at scale, but this one, you know, we have lot of experience with from the gaming side. And this is really cool, because you can actually bias the agent, because if it absorbs, you know, like Marriott ad a few times when it looks next time it looks for Marriott, first it gets biased.
So of course, we can do subscription because, you know, people want to be for AI apps and this and that for and you know, for people who are going to use it a lot, subscription is good, but at scale, the we can do same monetization that Google does.

So we can use, we can use our own, you know, stack, because we control the OS stack, the cost for loop for us decreases quite dramatically.

You know, do this, that cost is very high, but because, as Alfred said, We control the OS so we know what's on the screen without asking the vision model. So this runtime loop, each iteration becomes very efficient.
