They're bringing in a bunch of content, and then we're sitting there saying, adding an additional signal on top of all the other signals they're bringing to say, was this going to be generated or not? Usually, goal is two fold, depending on the type of organization it's either going to be we're providing them more evidence, hopefully, to get that content taken down, or we're giving them more confidence to put out public services

for typically going into their contact center, audio writer, starting to see more of that within the cloud, like Genesys five nines, many cases, we're integrating into their on prem systems, Legacy architecture, because these transformation efforts, which a lot of stories are in the process coming back to those in drop this is why a lot of us have this opportunity to put us in. So they're going through these multi year cloud transformation efforts, but most of the time we're starting on prem because they want to do something today.

They're only doing this because of a high frequency of attacks that they've seen that's particularly around those two use cases mentioned, like Target adverse specifically, you've seen that anecdotal evidence of that and some of the news that's leaked to journalists that have covered that story, and then also as part of their hiring processes, where the first thing I always tell these companies that I'm talking to the best thing you can do for this is actually just have the final pay $1,000 to put someone in a hotel, fly them out, and just do a violator in person, or you gotta use a sunshine like ours are better. Solution like ours. Most of these companies, you know, once they make a decision, it's hard to roll it back. So very

area for us. We're talking to a lot of foundation model companies to digital, twin companies, physical AI companies. Would love to understand how you're building this. We have seen some of the World Foundation model companies working with very specialized data annotators. And we ourselves are an investor in scale AI. So would love to see where you position yourself. That is
area for us. We're talking to a lot of foundation model companies to digital, twin companies, physical AI companies. Would love to understand how you're building this.

So would love to see where you position yourself. That is
Speaker 6
interesting. So what is the problem that we saw? What we're what we're solving is for, like, the lack of availability of free data, like, if you want to train, like, a physical AI data, and there's, like, actually a pretty huge scarcity when it comes like, your data set. And so just to give you some context, so infinite was created, like, about like, six, seven years ago, where we started actually working with retailers, like the largest retailers in the world, taking their catalogs in our product, creating like a 3d version of their product, putting them in a three environment, so that we could generate, then photo realistic, you know, like images of their product that then they could use for E commerce or merchandising, whatever it was. And so in doing so, not only did we create, probably, like, the largest data set that exists with like 300,000 sets that we have 10s of 1000s of environments that we created, but it's also the, obviously, the expertise in 3d the pipeline, the technology, the processes the IP in terms of how do you structure, like, the metadata that goes with it or with this pretty mesh? And also like the community, because we created a community of like, 1000s of modelers that we've trained, equipped with the tool, augmented with AI even more recently, so that they keep on being more efficient at creating, like those 3d mesh and and, yeah. So now, two years ago, realizing that we're sitting on a gold mine instead of like three I can imagine. So it's not really, again, the data set and the pipeline and everything that goes with it. So now we're being engaging with, like large technology companies, selling them those three data sets. So it's not only, again, like a mesh, it's also like pivot point, contact surfaces, material, normal maps, TV maps, all the good stuff that you need if you want to be at like a world model, exactly, but also working with robotics compound, you know, we're interested in very specific use cases and looking for this data. And so right now, we're very much like in the business of licensing this data sets that we have, and also licensing our capability to create new data if you need so, you know, like now we've been talking with other companies interested in liking robots for offices, where it's like a pretty easy expansion, or even, like factories or warehouses, that's something we can expand into as well. So doing this. But also, like what we've gathered is the appetite from these companies like robotics in particular, for a platform that they can integrate with to do like, you know, data set generation of demand, or data set augmentation of their own data, you know, like on demand. And so we have the pipeline. We have the know how, we have the IP. So that's something that now we're going to be launching later this year, this platform that is basically taking our platform and making it available, basically, to be outside.
interesting. So what is the problem that we saw?

So I do not have a demo yet of the platform again, like, because right now we've been in sensing, and we're in the face of putting it together. But I mean, happy to people engaging, like, in conversation with you, and if you want to know more about it.

Speaker 4
for sure. Fabian, I think it's a very interesting space for us. We also see a lot of strategic and expertise in this place. We feel a lot of these physical AI models when they will be created, and then when they'll be used, they will be on the mobile devices and the computer vision companies of the world, and that's where most of our chips go in. So we see a very big play there. Very interested in partnering and investing in a few companies in this space. So would love to do a little bit of my own research, come back and have a more detailed conversation on this. Is there a place I can connect with you? We
for sure. Fabian, I think it's a very interesting space for us. We also see a lot of strategic and expertise in this place.

you guys have actually, when I get back on the network, I'm the network for like half hour. I could talk to it, but I'm just struggling here, but I can talk to you briefly. So two things

Speaker 7
you're interested
in asking the question about a block of code, the
in asking the question about a block of code, the
in asking the question about a block of code, the
in asking the question about a block of code, the
Speaker 7
Assistant, you can ask a number of questions, like explaining the code, improving the code, more importantly, generating tests for the code. That's our big focus. The way that we're different is around context. So I still talk to people who say, we'll take a block of code and go to chat GPT and ask a question, or, I say, write a unit test. It'll be polite, it'll give you, it'll give you something back, right? But the relevancy is really low, typically, because what we do is we add, whenever you ask a question about a block of code before it gets sent, we're adding even more context to it. So for example, in this one file, some method might call this method, or mind method might call another method. So we're going to tease those together. In addition, this file might be talked to other files my project, other files might talk to so we're going to we're going to pick those out. We're going to bundle that up. Furthermore, if you're in a big organization, you could actually go look at other Git repos and get little pieces that need to call this class right or call the interface. Now we get all this context. We send that to the model, we say, generate unit tests for this. It has all this little connectivity, so the unit tests that are running there are much more fine tuned based on, based on the nature of your code base. And same thing, if you're saying, like, explain the code, you get an explanation about all this, all that connectivity, not just, oh, this is a, this is an algorithm, o to the 2n, or whatever, you know, blah, blah, blah. It's like, I want to know how it works in the context of my own COVID. So context is the number one answer to your question. Any of the popular models, it would be right here, and it would load all of them to about this far. Because if my network is working for like, for

But the relevancy is really low, typically, because what we do is we add, whenever you ask a question about a block of code before it gets sent, we're adding even more context to it. So for example, in this one file, some method might call this method, or mind method might call another method. So we're going to tease those together. In addition, this file might be talked to other files my project, other files might talk to so we're going to we're going to pick those out. We're going to bundle that up. Furthermore, if you're in a big organization, you could actually go look at other Git repos and get little pieces that need to call this class right or call the interface. Now we get all this context. We send that to the model, we say, generate unit tests for this. It has all this little connectivity, so the unit tests that are running there are much more fine tuned based on, based on the nature of your code base. And same thing, if you're saying, like, explain the code, you get an explanation about all this, all that connectivity, not just, oh, this is a, this is an algorithm, o to the 2n, or whatever, you know, blah, blah, blah. It's like, I want to know how it works in the context of my own COVID. So context is the number one answer to your question. Any of the popular models, it would be right here, and it would load all of them to about this far. Because if my network is working for like, for
Assistant, you can ask a number of questions, like explaining the code, improving the code, more importantly, generating tests for the code. That's our big focus. The way that we're different is around context. So I still talk to people who say, we'll take a block of code and go to chat GPT and ask a question, or, I say, write a unit test.

example, I'm, like, developing a web app. I don't want to kind of generate technical pages. Kind of do that because I know there's, like, I've used, like, bolt dot new I'm sure you're familiar with that. For like generating I find, like, it's not great for like, generating a fully functioning site, but it's really good for generating prototypes and then actually expanding that because, you know, building

Maybe I haven't tried. I mean, the way I used to do is we'd have a framework, you say, like, like rails, and it or something, and they would just, it would spit out like 50 files at your entire framework. I don't know if I would do it with the AI per se, but I'm just curious, yeah, because

David, so couple of follow up questions. I know you're on the side with us, too. Yeah, I'm a venture capitalist with Qualcomm ventures. Okay, so I was just listening in your in your panel here, nothing better than sort of listening to a few software engineers talk about a software development just want to do that. But you mentioned the biggest differentiation you have. One is on the context length. I've heard a lot of people, a lot of developers, shifting from tools like cursor, because they don't have a lot of context. Do you have, let's say, a limitation around that? Do you have a benchmark on how you compare with some of the other applications here benchmark in terms of context, context length? And yeah,

Speaker 7
there are internals. I don't know if it's like, how many tokens, like, exactly, yeah, one of the core engineers would know that. I mean, I could ask. I should know. But, I mean, there is a, there is a, as you go through the chain, like I've seen parameters like, like, 500 of this, or 5000 of this, or 500,000 to that, you know. So there is, there isn't an algorithm, because at the end of the day, you can only give so much, right? So what I do know is our algorithms, when you once you hit Enter, our algorithms are trying to do the best, to take the minimal viable related pieces, sort them, and then take, you know that. So we give you the best that we can, given the
there are internals. I don't know if it's like, how many tokens, like, exactly, yeah, one of the core engineers would know that. I mean, I could ask. I should know.

My point, though, is, so I've been here in the Silicon Valley area for over 20 years, across several vendors, so I've worked with my focus is all enterprise, right? Always has been, so even here. So for example, it's on the board. But, like, we have Intuit, who has 7000 engineers. We just got Walmart. Oh yeah, yeah, we're in the, like, the 1000s of engineers. I'll never say no to smaller teams, yeah, because, I mean, I love the sport, right? But at the same time, I've also learned that you could have small teams that, like, study book, Research Institute on the East Coast, or even, like JPL Pasadena, yeah, you have 10 people, but they're like, building they're building stations, you know? So I never say like, there's just 10 people, right?

Speaker 7
a little bit of as much as I know, but I'm not in the wrong person, 75 people. It's public. Raised $50 million for series A recently. Yeah, I don't know. We have 15 people in the go to market in United States. We came to market about a year ago, like three years, of course. And
a little bit of as much as I know, but I'm not in the wrong person, 75 people. It's public. Raised $50 million for series A recently. Yeah, I don't know. We have 15 people in the go to market in United States. We came to market about a year ago, like three years, of course. And

would you have, let's say, a ballpark figure for me on how you compare with two Odium augment labs, so in terms of traction? Yeah, that's easy. Maybe.

would you have, let's say, a ballpark figure for me on how you compare with two Odium augment labs, so in terms of traction? Yeah, that's easy. Maybe.
Speaker 7
Yeah. So our focus is eight AI agents across the full software development life cycle. This is where those tools sit, first, coding and copilot, right? We do that as well, right? But we also have agents for the product owners, project managers. We have agents for people to do a code review like the QA security test template, or team leads, architects, all the people that say, like, here's this feature we've been working on for a month. Is it ready? Okay? And everyone's got a different perspective on it, yeah. So we have AI agents that sit there as well, right? So there's a whole band of agents, because there's a lot of there's a lot of actors involved, right, in taking one idea to take it to production, right? And so that's where the multi agent approach is, where we're getting our traction.
Yeah. So our focus is eight AI agents across the full software development life cycle. This is where those tools sit, first, coding and copilot, right? We do that as well, right? But we also have agents for the product owners, project managers. We have agents for people to do a code review like the QA security test template, or team leads, architects, all the people that say, like, here's this feature we've been working on for a month.

for four years, and what we do is design the code. It's pretty rare. It's a pretty niche space, like no one really does, is a very hard problem to solve, actually, because llms don't understand design data. So anybody who tries to use an LLM to say, convert a design into code, you get really poor quality code. You don't get good output at all. We had to go train a foundation model from scratch on millions of figma designs to actually understand design data natively. That's what we did. So we built the foundation model that's able to automatically now convert design data into front end. Is that, like a foundation model trained from scratch? Do you use from scratch? Is it a BLM? Is it do you use OCR, or something like that? It's not using OCR. I mean, ultimately, what happened is we had like five or six smaller models inside it that we actually train, one for responsiveness, one for like tagging, one for doing, like, auto layouts and drop down. So it's a combination of model. I mean, if you're interested, we have a white paper about it. Yes, where can I find it? It's on our website. Okay, okay, I'll go find that. If you scan that, you will find a website, and then you will actually have white papers. Thank you. Thank you. So very interesting. How big is the company right now?

sizes, fizzy or like we we think that we are quite famous because, like, we focus local platform, which you can see that our workflow is quite forward, and we have like, 80,000 stars at GitHub, right? That's very personal. And maybe, like, these are all our clients, and 30 of them are from virtual 500 companies. And we have like, hundreds of other clients all over the world. And is the company based here in years? Yeah, we have a handout here. Our C corporation is US company, and so you have a lot of enterprise customers. What are the use cases. Is this a platform where you can build your own low code, no code agents? Or do you have workflow templates already built in which these enterprises are using? Oh, they mainly use us as similar to the insurance like they all, all these traditional enterprise they want to catch up with. We target all these requirements. So you just handle you just can super quick, super easy, implement general application with our platform just 10 hour. You can give, like the business department, to use that they don't need an idea background. And it's, I can see, it's, it's very visually focused.

Oh, we have like, 50 a team member right now, but we are quite bootstraps, so we are still create. Oh, still create. Yeah, and how is the revenue like? Oh, we want to try to make maybe 10 million this year. So that's, that's like a good amount of revenue for a bootstrap company. That's really amazing. Yeah, for sure. Do you plan to be raising anytime soon? Yeah, we are trying to fund some, do some fundraising in us right now. Yeah, so if you are interested in us, you can definitely, I would love to have a conversation around that, talk with me all that you can automatically improve. Yeah, I can do a little bit of my own research, and then maybe next week, I will come back to you. I have your email, I think, and then we can have a follow up conversation here.

Speaker 1
Talk about it, sometimes we are similar as we do that.
On the field, we like represent was more like a source change,
better than your knowledge.
Speaker 1
We have a lot of overlap. In that sense, we've invested more happily in like the genetic workflows from the start. So automating specific use cases, instead of, like just finding your company's information, so rather than just, like calling information out of Salesforce, actions going to ultimate, yeah, exactly yes, or like a rag orchestration fire some of the other differences is like route and agnostic. So
like, when you open
Speaker 1
your building, like certain agents, you can route, so whichever model,
depending on use case. But yeah, the
Speaker 1
short answer is, like, behind that, on integration, simply, put in there kind of
behind us. I know there's a Yeah,
Speaker 1
yeah. I mean, I think where people are finding the most value from it, at some point, we sell into a lot of financial services. They use, like, our sheets function for, like, research, etc. We have a lot of success with, like industrial companies. We really like complex products and technical documentation, etc. A lot of like growing SaaS companies who are like hiring a lot of people, if they are actually just more so interested in the knowledge management side. We have to find, like a rag going head to head at times. We're accurate, but,
Speaker 2
yeah, frankly, like, we always have politically made a lot of ways we need to compete
Speaker 1
with that. We're also a European company, so we're newer to the US market, to be a market in Europe right now. But yeah, in terms of headquarters, so quickly, like Scandinavians,
yes, yes, here because
Speaker 1
here, like Cloud, like, concentrated, like, if you tell
us how many Ferguson,
Speaker 3
but we're getting there Pretty like centric, then,
in terms of like our people, our
Speaker 2
clients, in terms of our clients now, I mean, we work in a lot of major
investment prices, Most
of our teams, especially like
Speaker 1
Our product outside. I for headquarters, I
doing By any chance,
Speaker 4
I think your face looks familiar. Hi, I'm Priyesh. What year were you? I graduated, 23 That's right. So what are you doing here? Rishan,
Speaker 3
so I work for GM enterprise innovation. So our team kind of does like early stage customer discovery. Work for kind of ideas that don't fit into core GM business. But as part of that, I also like come to conferences, look for interesting partnership opportunities.
So anything interesting here for you? Yeah? I mean, there's been a couple
Speaker 3
that might be interesting for automotive, yeah. I mean, I think some of the audio focused ones could be interesting for entertainment, yeah, yeah. There's some, like, enterprise tools that might be interesting. How are you very interesting?
Speaker 4
I work with Qualcomm venture. So I am in the venture capital of Qualcomm, the kind of similar sort of C companies which we can adopt Qualcomm wide as well as for investment propositions. It's been interesting. It's been quite interesting. I guess venture, the venture part of it has been more interesting than the corporate venture part of it. Yeah, yeah. We work with GM ventures sometimes, yeah. And I know Qualcomm has a lot of partnerships with GM, like our chips go in there. I hear the word in
the office. Technically, where do you live? I work out of
Speaker 4
the office. Oh, nice. I'm in San Mateo, but our office is here, but we don't have to come in every day. That's fine. We'd love to sort of catch up sometime I could eat, yeah, sure, yeah, yes, for sure. I'm surprised we didn't get to chat during Anderson. I'll just give you the cure. So yeah, are you quite active on a lot of these industry events?
My team, most of my team is In Detroit, so,
pretty much I Come across my way, They go
things like
that. Sourcing and
due to the Thai support like I'm the
Speaker 4
only associate in the team, and everyone else is a partner level. Trust me, I get involved in APD, which is happening, but then my primary is to focus and then bring a team, have a partner
Speaker 5
We got. Of like, designing platform. So there are, like over 10 million individual designers who are actively using our tool to generate those, those data. Yeah, the themes, the module, etc.
Speaker 4
Speaker 5
no. Actually, we don't. We don't. So it's not a generated way of doing this thing. So it's really a designing team. So do the plot and at the very beginning, and then the designers can put all the models inside that one, and then can put a vendor, etc. So it's not a generation got
Speaker 4
it so, so in that case, you would sort of compete with the omniverses of the world. Is that we go?
Speaker 5
So actually, omnibus, he the companies who are using the omnibus also use our data. So for the SFC, for example, yeah, to do the simulation,
Speaker 4
interesting, yeah. Interesting. Do you have, let's say, a research paper, or anything out there in the market? I would love to read through that. Is there a way I can find it? Yes,
you can see those are the papers.
Speaker 4
Oh, very interesting. I would love to read through them and maybe set up a more in detail follow up call. If any partnership with Qualcomm is of interest, we would love to explore that. Thank you, Jerry. I will reach out
We have definitely looked at a bigger piece of Facebook. What's the secret
Speaker 1
sauce? Don't compete with everything. You specifically compete with their false products. Most of their customers are proving to see that this is a problem that requires full attention. We're really competing with product manager and software developers on this feature versus us. We have a full team dedicated to this, so most of our customers are pulling pulse out and putting us in alongside all the other signals as they bring around on carrier intelligence, network intelligence, behavioral analysis, we're just
clearly focused on that team. Thank you.
Question, audio, video,
Speaker 1
information they interesting. We also integrate with KYC
for live detection and
Speaker 1
then last use case for financial services, or really public C suite, is around executive and brand protection. We'll integrate with signal metrics, data miners of the world sprinkler, where they're bringing in, usually it's just a brilliant search of a few individuals. They're bringing in a bunch of content, and then we're sitting there saying, adding an additional signal on top of all the other signals they're bringing to say, was this going to be generated or not? Usually, goal is two fold, depending on the type of organization it's either going to be we're providing them more evidence, hopefully, to get that content taken down, or we're giving them more confidence to put out public services
Speaker 4
and for deep fake detection, where in the company's architecture would you sort of integrate with, would you Be on meetings audio
Speaker 1
for typically going into their contact center, audio writer, starting to see more of that within the cloud, like Genesys five nines, many cases, we're integrating into their on prem systems, Legacy architecture, because these transformation efforts, which a lot of stories are in the process coming back to those in drop this is why a lot of us have this opportunity to put us in. So they're going through these multi year cloud transformation efforts, but most of the time we're starting on prem because they want to do something today. As they start with video we directly integrate with it's like a plugin similar to how the note takers work, which I'm sure you've seen for
zoom teams, WebEx, KYC, onboarding
Speaker 1
processes, some subs of the world, and then finally, with The brand on here, the social media monitoring tools, again, another integration.
Do you see, like, I'm just curious about this, but do you see a lot of
Speaker 4
market interest in video solutions? I met a very early stage company particularly focusing on
Speaker 1
that, yeah, Lydia. Maybe. Yeah, Lydia. So we've seen,
I think they want the some Optos.
Speaker 1
So yes, we're definitely seeing a lot of demand there. You might be able to figure it out. But, like, we're one of our initial design partners in this space, literally has the largest pipe shots units in some world. So that's where coming back to the big company from. They're only doing this because of a high frequency of attacks that they've seen that's particularly around those two use cases mentioned, like Target adverse specifically, you've seen that anecdotal evidence of that and some of the news that's leaked to journalists that have covered that story, and then also as part of their hiring processes, where the first thing I always tell these companies that I'm talking to the best thing you can do for this is actually just have the final pay $1,000 to put someone in a hotel, fly them out, and just do a violator in person, or you gotta use a sunshine like ours are better. Solution like ours. Most of these companies, you know, once they make a decision, it's hard to roll it back. So very
Speaker 4
Speaker 4
market mapping? Let's say starting with the market mapping level. But now, level, but down the line, when we figure out a few plus vendors, we would like to have a more what stage do you typically look at from an investment perspective? I would say anywhere above series A through Series F, or suppressor a, end of last year,
Speaker 1
run on led by dcbc and illuminate. So dcbc led our previous round development
services, but we
also brought on a lot of strategic
looking to raise the some time early
Speaker 1
next year. So that's of interest. Obviously, absolutely, conversations are always it's always
better to start. I can
Speaker 2
connect you with our VP of Finance, who will also be the
village. A lot of our clients are pretty
young. Oh, my God, sorry. I don't
Speaker 1
think this is funny. I was talking about how my wife was blessed when it ring like three or four occasions,
she just sent me this text. She
Speaker 1
just sent me this text that I missed read, and personally, she lost it again, but she's just going out with her friends. Just like, saying it ironically, it's funny. Just like, it's funny. I just forgot my wedding ring out of night, and I was like, literally, like, I forgot can't believe that, but yes, I'll connect you. If you don't hear from me in like a week
or so, feel free to ping me.
No issues there. I'm gonna try and work
through this. Yeah,
Physical AI is a big focus
Speaker 4
area for us. We're talking to a lot of foundation model companies to digital, twin companies, physical AI companies. Would love to understand how you're building this. We have seen some of the World Foundation model companies working with very specialized data annotators. And we ourselves are an investor in scale AI. So would love to see where you position yourself. That is
Speaker 6
interesting. So what is the problem that we saw? What we're what we're solving is for, like, the lack of availability of free data, like, if you want to train, like, a physical AI data, and there's, like, actually a pretty huge scarcity when it comes like, your data set. And so just to give you some context, so infinite was created, like, about like, six, seven years ago, where we started actually working with retailers, like the largest retailers in the world, taking their catalogs in our product, creating like a 3d version of their product, putting them in a three environment, so that we could generate, then photo realistic, you know, like images of their product that then they could use for E commerce or merchandising, whatever it was. And so in doing so, not only did we create, probably, like, the largest data set that exists with like 300,000 sets that we have 10s of 1000s of environments that we created, but it's also the, obviously, the expertise in 3d the pipeline, the technology, the processes the IP in terms of how do you structure, like, the metadata that goes with it or with this pretty mesh? And also like the community, because we created a community of like, 1000s of modelers that we've trained, equipped with the tool, augmented with AI even more recently, so that they keep on being more efficient at creating, like those 3d mesh and and, yeah. So now, two years ago, realizing that we're sitting on a gold mine instead of like three I can imagine. So it's not really, again, the data set and the pipeline and everything that goes with it. So now we're being engaging with, like large technology companies, selling them those three data sets. So it's not only, again, like a mesh, it's also like pivot point, contact surfaces, material, normal maps, TV maps, all the good stuff that you need if you want to be at like a world model, exactly, but also working with robotics compound, you know, we're interested in very specific use cases and looking for this data. And so right now, we're very much like in the business of licensing this data sets that we have, and also licensing our capability to create new data if you need so, you know, like now we've been talking with other companies interested in liking robots for offices, where it's like a pretty easy expansion, or even, like factories or warehouses, that's something we can expand into as well. So doing this. But also, like what we've gathered is the appetite from these companies like robotics in particular, for a platform that they can integrate with to do like, you know, data set generation of demand, or data set augmentation of their own data, you know, like on demand. And so we have the pipeline. We have the know how, we have the IP. So that's something that now we're going to be launching later this year, this platform that is basically taking our platform and making it available, basically, to be outside.
Speaker 4
Yeah, I totally understand the data set must be very valuable at the moment, and the moment you platform, it, is it? There will be a lot of big play, exactly, that's very interesting. Is there a demo on how you're thinking about the platform down the line?
Speaker 6
So I do not have a demo yet of the platform again, like, because right now we've been in sensing, and we're in the face of putting it together. But I mean, happy to people engaging, like, in conversation with you, and if you want to know more about it. So I'm the head of product, but also our CTO like, unfortunately, couldn't be here today, but it could be also like, a great resource, like to engage in this conversation,
Speaker 4
for sure. Fabian, I think it's a very interesting space for us. We also see a lot of strategic and expertise in this place. We feel a lot of these physical AI models when they will be created, and then when they'll be used, they will be on the mobile devices and the computer vision companies of the world, and that's where most of our chips go in. So we see a very big play there. Very interested in partnering and investing in a few companies in this space. So would love to do a little bit of my own research, come back and have a more detailed conversation on this. Is there a place I can connect with you? We
Speaker 6
can connect up on LinkedIn, and I'll take a photo as well of your I'm creating probably, like the biggest data set of largest data set of Perfect. Thank
you. How does this compare to, like, what
Speaker 7
you guys have actually, when I get back on the network, I'm the network for like half hour. I could talk to it, but I'm just struggling here, but I can talk to you briefly. So two things
Speaker 7
you're interested
in asking the question about a block of code, the
Speaker 7
Assistant, you can ask a number of questions, like explaining the code, improving the code, more importantly, generating tests for the code. That's our big focus. The way that we're different is around context. So I still talk to people who say, we'll take a block of code and go to chat GPT and ask a question, or, I say, write a unit test. It'll be polite, it'll give you, it'll give you something back, right? But the relevancy is really low, typically, because what we do is we add, whenever you ask a question about a block of code before it gets sent, we're adding even more context to it. So for example, in this one file, some method might call this method, or mind method might call another method. So we're going to tease those together. In addition, this file might be talked to other files my project, other files might talk to so we're going to we're going to pick those out. We're going to bundle that up. Furthermore, if you're in a big organization, you could actually go look at other Git repos and get little pieces that need to call this class right or call the interface. Now we get all this context. We send that to the model, we say, generate unit tests for this. It has all this little connectivity, so the unit tests that are running there are much more fine tuned based on, based on the nature of your code base. And same thing, if you're saying, like, explain the code, you get an explanation about all this, all that connectivity, not just, oh, this is a, this is an algorithm, o to the 2n, or whatever, you know, blah, blah, blah. It's like, I want to know how it works in the context of my own COVID. So context is the number one answer to your question. Any of the popular models, it would be right here, and it would load all of them to about this far. Because if my network is working for like, for
Speaker 2
example, I'm, like, developing a web app. I don't want to kind of generate technical pages. Kind of do that because I know there's, like, I've used, like, bolt dot new I'm sure you're familiar with that. For like generating I find, like, it's not great for like, generating a fully functioning site, but it's really good for generating prototypes and then actually expanding that because, you know, building
UIs, yeah, if you can ask a question,
Speaker 7
like, they'll build a framework, it'll start chucking along. And there'll be, like, a block that says, generate the file. Generate a file. It'll start generating the tabs for you. I've seen that stuff, like, pulled up news also being
Speaker 2
generated, web apps, mobile apps. Is this able to do that yet?
Speaker 7
Or, like, for the whole, like, I haven't put down the whole thing. Haven't tried. So sounds
like they can generate, like, an actual mobile app.
Speaker 7
Maybe I haven't tried. I mean, the way I used to do is we'd have a framework, you say, like, like rails, and it or something, and they would just, it would spit out like 50 files at your entire framework. I don't know if I would do it with the AI per se, but I'm just curious, yeah, because
I've seen that they're doing it so but,
yeah, what's the cost
for So, less than 10
internet, just like
Speaker 7
too many people, could go download it today and start using it, which is pretty rad, $15 per user per month, and that's we host it. SaaS, you don't have to worry about it. Developers install the plugins, and they start using it right away. But then you also get a lot more features
Speaker 8
and Yeah. And also, you can
Speaker 7
start a 14 day trial right away, put your email in, no credit card, and you get all all the bells and whistles. I'm not sure. I'm sure there is one, but yeah, he's at the top. You know, once you're interested try it out, you can do this right now is your own personal email and kick the tires and stuff. We did this as a reminder. We just want to be a paper friendly, eco friendly suit, Java, JavaScript. Thank you.
Speaker 7
We do have every month we do a live like demo, and they're saved on YouTube. Go back like two weeks and see if they're facing kind of a bigger version what I would do today, but it's full end to end. So in like 45 minutes, you'll see the full kit and caboodle. So if you start the free trial, like I would just go there, get a good clip of all the little things you can do that start happening. You guys open source. You get an open source
version of the total
channel, because kiddo starts Yeah,
exactly.
In the open source one, basically
Speaker 7
you have to provide your own keys, right? If you use the developer plan, you don't have to bring your own keys, like for VS code. But this is limited. If you do the free trial, if it's unlimited, and if you pay the $15 you don't pay for keys. So the keys are part of that cost. Cool, yeah, as an engineer, I talk for free, but I get paid by scanning, I guess. Oh yeah, I'm just kidding,
Speaker 4
David, so couple of follow up questions. I know you're on the side with us, too. Yeah, I'm a venture capitalist with Qualcomm ventures. Okay, so I was just listening in your in your panel here, nothing better than sort of listening to a few software engineers talk about a software development just want to do that. But you mentioned the biggest differentiation you have. One is on the context length. I've heard a lot of people, a lot of developers, shifting from tools like cursor, because they don't have a lot of context. Do you have, let's say, a limitation around that? Do you have a benchmark on how you compare with some of the other applications here benchmark in terms of context, context length? And yeah,
Speaker 7
there are internals. I don't know if it's like, how many tokens, like, exactly, yeah, one of the core engineers would know that. I mean, I could ask. I should know. But, I mean, there is a, there is a, as you go through the chain, like I've seen parameters like, like, 500 of this, or 5000 of this, or 500,000 to that, you know. So there is, there isn't an algorithm, because at the end of the day, you can only give so much, right? So what I do know is our algorithms, when you once you hit Enter, our algorithms are trying to do the best, to take the minimal viable related pieces, sort them, and then take, you know that. So we give you the best that we can, given the
Speaker 4
boundaries, if you will, right? I get that for sure. So internally, we are evaluating, sort of adopting one of these tools for all combined. We haven't done that so far. But is your focus more on individual developers or enterprises? How enterprise ready is the product today? Good question.
So where are you located?
Local here. I'm in Santa Cruz.
Speaker 4
I would love to sort of have a follow up conversation on this. Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.
Speaker 7
My point, though, is, so I've been here in the Silicon Valley area for over 20 years, across several vendors, so I've worked with my focus is all enterprise, right? Always has been, so even here. So for example, it's on the board. But, like, we have Intuit, who has 7000 engineers. We just got Walmart. Oh yeah, yeah, we're in the, like, the 1000s of engineers. I'll never say no to smaller teams, yeah, because, I mean, I love the sport, right? But at the same time, I've also learned that you could have small teams that, like, study book, Research Institute on the East Coast, or even, like JPL Pasadena, yeah, you have 10 people, but they're like, building they're building stations, you know? So I never say like, there's just 10 people, right?
But that's also where, like,
to your point, though,
Speaker 7
like, from a sales perspective, we have a team, like an internal team that focuses on SMB on this part, and then, like, Doug and I work together. We're focused entirely on this. Got it
Speaker 4
How big is the company? So I come from the venture capital, and my interest is also from an investment perspective, we'd love to understand how big is the company. Is there any plan of raising capital in the coming future? I can give you
Speaker 7
a little bit of as much as I know, but I'm not in the wrong person, 75 people. It's public. Raised $50 million for series A recently. Yeah, I don't know. We have 15 people in the go to market in United States. We came to market about a year ago, like three years, of course. And
Speaker 4
would you have, let's say, a ballpark figure for me on how you compare with two Odium augment labs, so in terms of traction? Yeah, that's easy. Maybe.
Speaker 7
Yeah. So our focus is eight AI agents across the full software development life cycle. This is where those tools sit, first, coding and copilot, right? We do that as well, right? But we also have agents for the product owners, project managers. We have agents for people to do a code review like the QA security test template, or team leads, architects, all the people that say, like, here's this feature we've been working on for a month. Is it ready? Okay? And everyone's got a different perspective on it, yeah. So we have AI agents that sit there as well, right? So there's a whole band of agents, because there's a lot of there's a lot of actors involved, right, in taking one idea to take it to production, right? And so that's where the multi agent approach is, where we're getting our traction.
Speaker 4
Very interesting. People say, like, well, like, AI for
Speaker 7
software development. They think only this, yeah, it's like, that's all it is, right? Very
Speaker 4
interesting. Do you mind if I take a picture of
Speaker 8
this? I you, David,
Speaker 4
I would appreciate a follow up call if you have the availability for it, and maybe if you can connect me internally to someone who also looks at fundraising, that would be great.
Speaker 7
In fact, I can just give you the name. Oh, yeah. Even easier. Yep, there's only one person. It's kitchen Mark, I T, A, I T, A M, A R, at Coto, or I'm sorry, sorry, you're in LinkedIn, right? Yes, it's Mark Friedman, F, R, i e,
d, M, a n, yeah, that's got it. He's the guy
Perfect. Thanks a lot, David, I appreciate your Time today.
Down, thank you. Thank
you. Yeah, okay, you
can Wow,
I know it let's say you pay $100,000 that's a Good deal.
Speaker 9
Soft. Logic structure.
Speaker 9
I'll write to you. Let
me scan
the QR code. I can
send you some information.
I know. Capitalist. Okay? For us, I would love to understand
Speaker 4
what you're building. We've been in market
Speaker 4
for four years, and what we do is design the code. It's pretty rare. It's a pretty niche space, like no one really does, is a very hard problem to solve, actually, because llms don't understand design data. So anybody who tries to use an LLM to say, convert a design into code, you get really poor quality code. You don't get good output at all. We had to go train a foundation model from scratch on millions of figma designs to actually understand design data natively. That's what we did. So we built the foundation model that's able to automatically now convert design data into front end. Is that, like a foundation model trained from scratch? Do you use from scratch? Is it a BLM? Is it do you use OCR, or something like that? It's not using OCR. I mean, ultimately, what happened is we had like five or six smaller models inside it that we actually train, one for responsiveness, one for like tagging, one for doing, like, auto layouts and drop down. So it's a combination of model. I mean, if you're interested, we have a white paper about it. Yes, where can I find it? It's on our website. Okay, okay, I'll go find that. If you scan that, you will find a website, and then you will actually have white papers. Thank you. Thank you. So very interesting. How big is the company right now?
We're about 25 to 30 people based in the US, Singapore. Company. Don't
Speaker 4
Speaker 2
Just one of our big clients. Yeah, people just passed with Brad. He's the head of all marketing Developer Relations at Nvidia. He's one of our clients. What interesting? Delta Airlines, the big client of ours, etc. So
nice. And if I may
ask, have you raised money? Is there a plan to raise
Speaker 8
sometime soon? Oh, I mean, of course, we're an AI infrastructure company. So we're a round, you know? Yeah,
we'll do a B round whenever I feel
Speaker 2
like it. So, yeah, lots of runway at the moment. So no plans on the near future. We have real, multi year, multi million dollar AI contracts
and, yeah, renewals and
Speaker 2
tech. But we don't do llms whatsoever. We do true signal processing, right? So, and all of our clients are blue chip, so we black rocks, a client, Sanofi, the drug makers, a client, Nvidia, yeah, like that, yeah. So, you know it's we're kind of an aberration in the AI world, where a lot of stuff is yes, interesting. I wasn't aware there's an engagement. We would love to sort of a lot of our deals come through the business
Speaker 10
units. But yeah, you connected to the business unit? I mean, it's the CMO. Yeah.
Speaker 2
So the guy knows I need him with Jeremy crawl okay with Arnie, whose last name I don't remember. Jeremy. With Jeremy.
I think the CMO is
Speaker 2
gone. We figured my partners, but Jeremy calls you sorry to But Jeremy,
yeah, that took me off. I think we're just
in data line,
Speaker 2
very timely. Some nice light reading for you our white paper stuff. That's the non mathematical one, the mathematical, but you are going to be using that text, so it's a fun story. Internally,
Speaker 4
we do two causal computes on a Super Cluster in Virginia. I
Speaker 2
think you know, unique things, great meeting here today. I will come back and see if there's any venture interest as well. If I can tag along, we should at least be having conversations. I'll just do right meeting folks. And
Speaker 10
our last year was read by, led by Jeffrey Katzenberg, you know, the founder,
so wonder co over there, did our a revenue.
we just added
from the CFA
Speaker 2
Colin Anderson, you took them from like five to 100 million. And then also, and also the next equity, which is Rami versus the CTO apple. And I felt
that like 20 star areas,
Speaker 2
like bird experience, Game of like, play. But, you know, we spent five years building so we have an actual angle the reality. But you
are potential customers, right? So, like, always love working with
Speaker 2
customers that Accenture is a customer of ours as well. Yeah. So it's kind of how they kind of get the
company, yeah, determine your system. It's mathematically impossible, so I'm sure they prefer to say that our stuff is transferring spikes. I think actually the video tells us real enterprise points spiking. So the guy was just here applied science. We're not researching. So we've done some ways to solve problems. We're also putting a
little bit, 500 miles.
It as you guys do, TP use, amount dragon
Speaker 2
branded. I happen to have one of my guys here. A little bit Snapdragon stuff. So we evaluate whether, if you spend $100 million that's a use case that has been the biggest for us at first, right? Because every single client ask them, we'll do more. So they see that, and they go, so this is a big tech breakthrough for us that we didn't quite expect, right? You know when you stumble onto something, yeah. And so then everybody goes, well, what about if we have a weather failure? Can you tell us our playing cascade failures? Right? And we're like, we could we want to fish our market first. And then, yes, all of you. My background was started my career at NASA Administration Center doing that stuff, and I decided to like doing it, yeah, mostly because rebelling it to my father. My father has a PhD math, okay. He now works for me, by the way. So my father was the principal engineer at Qualcomm, just a Qualcomm, super Priyesh. So actually, a lot of that tech, right, right? Like, one thing of, like, senior generation. So when he retired from Qualcomm, he can nods, we're kind of like fan familiar.
But you know, fall companies always the term free tool engineer.
Some companies like, pay
me about right? So then when I came back around, I went hard arts
Speaker 8
and marketing for a long time, and I came back around isolated. So then I didn't like the space until we started there. So but yeah, marketing has the most spent. You're spending a trillion dollars a year on brand, advertising, stadium, all this stuff. No one goes for it. We can actually prove what statistical profits one of those things on the back of this,
references, right? Yeah, but my
favorite chart in the whole thing
Speaker 8
is, is this one? These are all the causal validity tests we do across all of our data and methodologies to guarantee its statistical validity. So, like, you know, like customers, they're like, how do you know? And we're like, well, we use synthetic and actual, real world data, yeah.
Speaker 8
So we just, we just announced, this is really a break to show we're announcing SMS and everything, yeah. We've been kind of like private, like selling some stuff on the side
to kind of get some tests. Very exciting.
Speaker 8
We should staff. It's all friends, yeah, well, it's Good. Shane, absolutely. Thanks so much. And
Speaker 9
eating process, very Different. I know,
Speaker 8
This building.
Just but, yeah, For me To be here.
1:02:45
Is that A guy I
1:02:52
new Neo product with trauma, one
1:03:00
of The hardest part I
Speaker 8
1:03:46
for Ice Baby I Like.
1:15:48
Speaker 4
1:16:52
portfolio, I always want to apply
Speaker 4
1:17:03
this information COVID.
1:17:20
Different
1:17:20
sizes, fizzy or like we we think that we are quite famous because, like, we focus local platform, which you can see that our workflow is quite forward, and we have like, 80,000 stars at GitHub, right? That's very personal. And maybe, like, these are all our clients, and 30 of them are from virtual 500 companies. And we have like, hundreds of other clients all over the world. And is the company based here in years? Yeah, we have a handout here. Our C corporation is US company, and so you have a lot of enterprise customers. What are the use cases. Is this a platform where you can build your own low code, no code agents? Or do you have workflow templates already built in which these enterprises are using? Oh, they mainly use us as similar to the insurance like they all, all these traditional enterprise they want to catch up with. We target all these requirements. So you just handle you just can super quick, super easy, implement general application with our platform just 10 hour. You can give, like the business department, to use that they don't need an idea background. And it's, I can see, it's, it's very visually focused. Was that, like, Is that how you're differentiating yourself from, yeah, that's our male advantage. Yeah, very interesting. And how big is the company right now? Oh, we have like, 50 a team member right now, but we are quite bootstraps, so we are still create. Oh, still create. Yeah, and how is the revenue like? Oh, we want to try to make maybe 10 million this year. So that's, that's like a good amount of revenue for a bootstrap company. That's really amazing. Yeah, for sure. Do you plan to be raising anytime soon? Yeah, we are trying to fund some, do some fundraising in us right now. Yeah, so if you are interested in us, you can definitely, I would love to have a conversation around that, talk with me all that you can automatically improve. Yeah, I can do a little bit of my own research, and then maybe next week, I will come back to you. I have your email, I think, and then we can have a follow up conversation here. Definitely, that'd be great. Thanks, I'll take one of these. Thank you. Very nice.
