S Speaker 10:32I'm on your LinkedIn page, just looking at you and I'm but I first want to make sure your LinkedIn page just says, BHP, yes, welcome ventures. That's correct. Okay, I'm very good at faces. I'm very bad at names, but something like I made this guy, so I don't know if he maybe spoke while you were with main lower Morpheus,

S Speaker 20:56probably Morpheus, if we did, if we didn't admit it would have been during Morpheus, because Morpheus had a thesis around space, but, but I'm not entirely sure. Nicholas anyway,

S Speaker 11:12Thanks for the time. If it makes any sense, I would love for you to just tell me a little bit about yourself and qualco and in the context of a seed round, what does you What do you typically do? And then I can go over a quick presentation about the business.

S Speaker 13:56in the context of this round now it's labeling it as a seed. It's kind of a larger seed? Yeah, I guess I could call it earlier. I'll explain later. Yes, but I do want to know, do you when you do a seed grant, do you lead, or do you not lead? Do you have a philosophy around that?

S Speaker 24:13Yeah, I think about 80% of the investments we do, we follow, so only few investments that we have led as such, particularly, I would say, in this space as well, because it's slightly newer for us, we wouldn't be our lead investor.

S Speaker 14:29Got it? Okay, perfect. Okay, I'm gonna start a presentation here and talk you through what it is that we do. Yeah, I'm quite excited about it. I think you're gonna like it, and then we'll talk about the fundraising later, but the technology first, because I think we're both

S Speaker 114:34where do we see the opportunity? We do see Golden Dome, President Trump's space initiative, playing a big role in this. We already have a robust hardware business. We see a massive business in the software and then specifically in the services that can unlock this. So if you think of video monitoring as a business model, right? So whether it's now ring or something more enterprise monitoring, the hardware is actually a small part of the business. It's the software and the service behind it that becomes the valuable thing. If you think of PDT is, might be a good example. Okay, so this is where we are. We already have proven product market fit. We have a number of customers, a lot of cameras update. We have 100 already, 19 of them already in orbit. 100 more on order. We already booked 7 million. Booked and banked 7 million of 12 million that's already under contract. The rest of that five is still a few quarters out in future, and we have lots of traction. Specifically with the DOD, there's a National Defense Authorization Act. This was still signed by Biden. This was done last year. Now tools for video for on orbit, security on all DoD spacecraft. We have a facility clearance sponsor from the Office of the Secretary of Defense and Air Force Research Lab sponsoring a commercial research agreement with us. So we're raising 8 million focusing mostly on R and D for this ground segment, but also sales and marketing expanding this channel. I really want every spacecraft to have some of our cameras on it. Camera's just a hook. That's how we get people. It's the ring builder, right? But if you look at the actual value proposition, it's behind the camera. So if you look at this moment in time, it's very clear. There's a lot of evidence here. We have an urgent need for remote sensing, for timely alerts and warnings, specifically in space, right? It's under the $50 billion increase in defense spending once in a lifetime. Specific specifically focused on the tenants and the single biggest line item in the golden dam bill, this is the House and the Senate armed security committee reconciliation bill is 7.2 billion for military based base sensors. Okay, and so I believe that we're uniquely positioned to change. Sorry. I think I lost your voice. Yes. Okay. I was saying we believe really uniquely positioned for this, because we are the only ones that can create a video experience in the ground. If you look at what the spacecraft management looks like today, people are literally staring at spreadsheets. They're looking at lots of little tables of discrete measurements. We can change that to be a video first experience, whether that is now the actual video that we capture, or the digital twins that we have on the ground of what the mission should look like, or the deviation from that, we can really change that game. So over yet, and that's what we do. We really believe this guy. By the way, all of these images that I showed you were still frames from video that we captured on orbit.

S Speaker 217:04This is very, very exciting. Can you hear me? Sorry, I think my internet is working weirdly, so I'm breaking up a little bit. Let me keep my video off, in case that's easier. Okay, yeah. Can you hear me? Now, I can hear you. This is very exciting, for sure, and amazing to see the traction that you have already done by just raising $5 million round. That's That's pretty amazing. On your end. Can you tell me a little bit more about the edge computing piece as well? What's the technical architecture that you use

S Speaker 117:33behind them? What's the satellite? We obviously use a module from them, but we have to order that to make sure it works in the harsh environments of space. So we have our own electronics input stages, and obviously mechanical intelligence is quite different. We built our own BSB from Linux, from the ground up for that, and then we use, there's lots of different machine vision, like libraries that we use open CVS one in terms of the specific groundbreaking technology that we developed. It's actually kind of counting to the A lot of people are just using typical AI models, large language models, or something like that, machine vision models. We do do that, but they've also introduced this other element to it, which is that we in space, unlike, say, a self driving car, in a self driving car, you really have no idea what the camera is going to see. When you turn on the camera, it could be anywhere, and they could be pedestrians, they could be cyclists, they could be cars. You don't know what it's gonna see in space. That's quite different. When you turn on the camera, you know where the spacecraft is, you know where it's pointing. You know what it's gonna see on Earth, you're gonna see America's gonna see Australia, and you know what stars it's gonna see, which way they should be oriented to exactly. So that means we have a very good reference point to start off with. Design is everything the way that we expected it. So we create a digital twin that is ad model. Today. It's more like a 3d gaming channel. We create a model of the earth, of the stars, of the spacecraft itself, of the sun, and then of the mission over time. And then, using that, we create we can almost render it. We don't actually render the channel, but we create a data set that now says, This is what we expect. This is what it should apply. And you can think of that just as a semantically labeled that says, this is earth, this is America. If we now say, what do we actually measure? We see something different. Now use the machine vision and AI techniques to compare from that forward. So if you look at how the human vision works, it actually works in a very similar way it is. You always start off with a presumption of what you're going to see, and then you're trying to quickly see you snatch to what was your expectation, which, by the way, that explains why we have so many optical illusions. If it wants to see something, so it snaps very quickly to what it thinks it is. And so by using that, we can come into quicker insights, and we can save a lot of bandwidth. I think I answered the question, but let me know if there's something else.

S Speaker 220:40very, very interesting because for all these projects, are they just the hardware piece for now, or are they both the hardware and software piece?

S Speaker 120:47But it's always the software too. I mean, we monetize the hardware with a couple of exceptions. We have sold test, which is really software. Yeah, we are building is the software that lives on the edge computer and also on the gap. So we have a encoder there and the decoder here. You have the pre visualization there and the actual visualization here, and a bunch of forward interconnection and round trip delay informed the transmission scheme. This is a bunch of software that lives on both sides of the thing. So we have sold this to multiple customers. So far. We've mostly sold hardware and this, we have not yet sold the ground based software, and we've sold lots of the embedded software. Yeah. So this is sort of how we solve this, and we sold this, and how we want to do this.

S Speaker 221:28Very interesting. So this is interesting. I think it does fit our thesis. The only thing is that we have a team we're not very aware on computer vision and space assets. So I will have to do a little bit more research on my end and get back to you with some more questions. As a next step on my end, I'd also like to loop in Tushar, who leads our computer vision investment thesis. He's also been, he's led a lot of computer vision business units at Qualcomm for multiple decades as well. So I'd loop in loop him as well for the follow up call. I would appreciate if you could send me the deck or any of the reading materials that you would suggest I use for getting myself up to the speed.

S Speaker 122:00Okay, I will do that. And when you schedule the next meeting, just give me enough a face up. I want to make sure that I also invite one of my technical people, then our CSO or CTO,

S Speaker 122:13I am keen to, I was originally keen to close it before summer, but I guess we're already at summer now. I'm probably hoping to close it by September, something like that. So, so it is kind of an interesting scenario, because, because we already have revenue, basically cash flow positive. Yeah, that's why I said you could consider this early a because we're really just trying to raise money to grow to kind of attach this big software opportunity, the software as a service to the existing hardware, right? So going back to this picture, we already have a winner. So these computers are successful right now. This will happen over time, mobile and our own ecosystem, but what you want to do now is to build this platform of ground software. For me, it's more important that we find the right partner at the right terms than to find the money very quickly. We're just trying to expand the business
