S Speaker 10:53I would have to get the exact number. I'd have to double check

S Speaker 21:00that. I mean, which is what I'm trying to understand is, how many customers do you approach and versus like, for example, if a an employee at a company has a project, and then they open an account, they use their credit card, right? And they start using it well, which is the self serve part, and then, and then, the other one is where you're signing larger PCBs. So firstly, land and
that.

S Speaker 11:27expand. So that's where people are expanding contracts. That's about 25% of our revenue comes from land and expand. But the exact breakdown of how much of that land and expand comes from expanding a, you know, a sort of written contract with the larger customers, versus expanding completely organically within the product. I'd have to double check what that is. I don't want to give a figure, because I don't know what the figure. I don't know figures off the top of my head, we do expect that organic motion to increase substantially as we build in more collaborative features into the product.

S Speaker 22:35And are you going to describe a customer journey if you're going to do it later, which is, what's, what's the customer journey before using solve, what are they trying to solve? And then, and then, after using solve, what's the customer journey?

S Speaker 12:48Yeah, absolutely. So we're going to get to the product in a moment. But essentially, almost all attorneys right now, if they're doing patent drafting, for example, almost all of the workflows are being done inside Microsoft Word, PDF previewers and and email when they're doing back and forth with their, for example, with their, with their in house teams being indirectly. A lot of the space in IP, a lot of the software space, is almost completely unsung. If you look at the IP industry and the software incumbents that are there, they're sort of an aqua Clarivate questel And they built software. It's kind of the classic story of vertical SaaS over the last 1520 years. It's stuff that you could have done inside an Excel spreadsheet, and you're building vertical SaaS around that. So CRMs for managing all these different sort of documents being updated so on. But part of our thesis is that as of the step change in the performance of large language models that happened in the last 1824, months, there have been a whole bunch of software applications that you can now build that fundamentally you just couldn't build 18 to 24 months ago. So you know, the reason why there's no real software in common for drafting, for prosecution and so on is because you couldn't really build software that was able to offer 4050, 60% efficiency improvements. So it's a long way saying that we're not really replacing any existing software at the moment, beyond word and email and PDF previous, that's what most of our customers are currently using. And so we're coming in, and we're providing something totally

S Speaker 410:04You. Chris is Priscilla here. So in your workflow, you mentioned that there could be a number of workflows. How would you do you do anything special? Or is there a specific workflow that supports a standard essential patents versus like, is there a difference in and again, you know, just want to understand if there's any specifics around how you treat, you know, the prosecution or the drafting of patents that you know maybe are more specific to a particular standard, or does that become part of the workflow in in this in this program?

S Speaker 514:07Yeah, so this automated generation of this yellow box stuff, right? Does it vary from IP teams to IP team, for instance? Or is it like if, if two IP team was using or drafting the same application and they were given the same information, is the output gonna be different? Basically doing very same similar things across IP team? It's
Yeah, so this automated generation of this yellow box stuff, right? Does it vary from IP teams to IP team, for instance?

Or is it like if, if two IP team was using or drafting the same application and they were given the same information, is the output gonna be different? Basically doing very same similar things across IP team? It's
S Speaker 114:35super different. It's super different between IP teams, even within the same IP team, when you're talking to attorneys, the way in which they want to draft these applications, and I'm not just talking about the workflow, but actually also the output, the style in which they're drafting each one of these actions can vary even for the same jurisdiction, same IP team, same technology field, they will have individual drafting preferences. This is one of the things we learn very early on when you start a company. And so it's very important, because you're dealing with experts in the pandemic, you have to be able to adapt the AI to whatever they to, whatever they consider to be the best way of drafting for this particular, this particular technology field. So yeah, it does vary for different users. One other important aspect is that you can use the AI as much as little as you like. So, you know, the attorney can actually, and this is a very common workflow that we see they can draft their claims and then use the AI to draw, for example, the specification, to make sure that each part of each claim is supported enabled by the specification, that it's linked to the things, the reference emails. And then actually, then freezes up a lot more time for the attorneys to spend on the claims. And so one of the things that we see, in addition to efficiency improvements, is that people actually feel like the quality of their work is improving by using AI, because they're able to dedicate more time to, for example, drafting a high quality set of claims, which are really the most important part of the of the application. But they can also use the AI drafting claims. They can also sort of interact with the AI, so classic sort of chat interface, where they can ask questions and so on, but they can also instruct it to make edits. So in this case, rewrite these claims to make play one broader, and the AI then applies all of those changes in track changes it only can then go in, just like in words, and accept, reject each one of those. So very sort of flexible, interactive sort of process. I mean, they can also accept all. Last thing this user is going to do on the drafting front is switch to the Review tab. This is like a sort of Grammarly for pattern style interface, so you click Run review the AI checks for things like and seen basis issues, pattern, specification support, so just useful for doing a last minute check of the application before we submit it to the panel office.
super different.

16:33So that's a drafting product. Yeah,
So that's a drafting product. Yeah,
So that's a drafting product. Yeah,
So that's a drafting product. Yeah,
S Speaker 516:35Chris, in terms of the AI that's running the background, is this using like open source models to train this, or is it something proprietary? That's yours? It's

Chris, in terms of the AI that's running the background, is this using like open source models to train this, or is it something proprietary? That's yours? It's
S Speaker 116:47a variety of different models. So we build on top of both foundation models and, you know, proprietary models as well. The foundation models that we build on top of are provided by both open AI and anthropic. And then what we do is we take those models and we build out all of these sequential calls for the last language models, basically these planning algorithms which then route different sets of inputs and outputs between different sets of models, different sort of custom sequences of prompts. So you have all these things going on for herd, which is why we're able to output something that's much higher quality than, for example, something like off the shelf, like chatgpt or something like that. Very importantly, for this kind of application, security and confidentiality are the number one most important things for both our customers and for us. So none of that data is being used for training any of these AR models of any sort. All of the data is encrypted both in transit and in storage. It gets stored on enterprise AWS service, so our customers get all the security assurances that come with using Enterprise AWS, and there's no third party that's storing viewing or monitoring any of that data in any way, including us assault intelligence, so we can't view or access any of the customers data. And so yeah, we take that super seriously, but yeah, we do build on top of foundation models as well as some other customer

S Speaker 621:53that's coming out question on some of your enterprise customers. Have you encountered some of them using Contract Lifecycle Management solutions like ironclad for contract drafting, and if so, how do you displace them, from a workflow perspective specific to IP.

S Speaker 622:21you can also draft and review contracts, right? A lot of the I've seen certain IP teams also use, the likes of ironclad spot draft and so on and so forth, right? So I'm just wondering if that's an overlap, and is it the workflows that's that makes it very, very specific for IP teams to displace them,
you can also draft and review contracts, right? A lot of the I've seen certain IP teams also use, the likes of ironclad spot draft and so on and so forth, right?

S Speaker 122:40right? So if we're talking about drafting and prosecution, as far as I'm aware, it is impossible to do that inside something like I'm glad there's a number of things about drafting pan applications that is just super different from, for example, reviewing a commercial contract. They're multi modal For start, so you have to be able to deal with figures, chemical structures, biological sequences. They're very technical. The layout of these is kind of specific. You know, you have your you have your default sections, you're always going to have a title, an abstract summary, a detailed description, a set of claims, and so on. So, yeah, there's a lot of things about patterns that are very specific, and you need specific workflows, specific algorithms and specific sort of stylistic customizations in order for it to be useful for the attorney. So No, we've never met anyone who would try and use something like it like an ironclad for doing something like drafting or prosecution work.

S Speaker 725:50So Chris across all these players, what's, what's really the barrier to entry, right? I mean, you mentioned that there's common models, and then on top of it, you have your custom sauce, which is a mix of some of the training that you do, and the UI and so forth, and I guess, your domain expertise in the legal space, but I'm sure really trying to figure out what is the barrier to entry for others.

S Speaker 729:08Yeah. So, just, so just, just on that, right? He, I mean, let's say, let's say it's given that you guys are a quick entry into into the space. But I'm trying to figure out what is the barrier to entry for other fast followers, right? So maybe others are slow, but then they could do it. But then, if we think through you say that it's about the three, the three pronged approach, so that you embed within the organization, it's difficult for outside counsel to then use something else and so forth. But then, essentially, that's a very difficult sale, because you're gonna have to try to convince both the company and the outside counsel, and they might have different interests in terms of different financial interests, right? But right to see, what is the professional value add versus what's the tool value add? So I'm just wondering if it turns into a difficult sale. While you say that 50% of the time, I wonder if the professional law firms, if, like, how hard is it for them to accept that fact? Yeah.
Yeah. So, just, so just, just on that, right? He, I mean, let's say, let's say it's given that you guys are a quick entry into into the space.

S Speaker 129:57So firstly, the important caveat is that we're not having to sell simultaneously into in house teams and outside councils, because, for the most part, at the moment, neither one of them are using special software for doing drafting and objection responses. So you know, we're able to sell into one of them. And if they can persuade, if the in house team can persuade their outside council to join the platform, and likewise, if the outside counsel can persuade the in house team to join the platform. They can actually get added value from the products, because they might have have an easier time, for example, collecting disclosures from their inventors, or an easier time reviewing applications that they're also counselor draft. And that's, I think, one of the key things for getting network effects, where you have more people, the more people you have on the platform, the more value everyone gets from it. So I think there are some incentives available there for people to want to have their outside counsel and their in house team on site, the same platform, and actually starting to see that now, the way that we've onboarded some of the enterprises that we're already selling into and now also more of their outside counsel has actually been because their outside counsel recommended our platform, and then likewise, their in house team starts using it, then they recommend the outside platform. So that's the one thing I just mentioned. I don't think you have to simultaneously sell into both groups at the same time. I think you can send to one and then expand. The second part of your question was on, you know, 50% efficiency improvements. Doesn't that maybe go against, perhaps the outside council in census if they're charging, you know, billable hours kind of thing. The first thing I would say is that, you know, we outside councils, and we're selling into 150 IP teams now, majority of them being law firms, and the biggest law firms in the world. I think there's just a recognition that it's not sort of five, 10% efficiency improvements to this kind of software it's offering. It's 4050, 60% plus. And we have some people in the market adopting that kind of technology. There's a big incentive for people to adopt it, because it's not realistic to just refuse to realistic to just refuse to adopt this kind of software. So we are actually this kind of technology. I think that's historically not been true in legal tech, but because now the software is able to offer such big efficiency improvements, I think a lot of people are doing it. And then the other thing is, of course, I think a lot of legal work, particularly in patents, has been moving towards fixed, fixed cost billing, which does therefore incentivize your phones to use technology to be more efficient.

S Speaker 732:06So have you done any price elasticity models? See if you're selling a solution at 699, or 649 What? What? What do you think the customer base is versus if you were selling it for, let's say 199 right? What would be the what? What, what, how. What do you think that would do to the industry?
So have you done any price elasticity models? See if you're selling a solution at 699, or 649 What? What? What do you think the customer base is versus if you were selling it for, let's say 199 right? What would be the what? What, what, how. What do you think that would do to the industry?

S Speaker 132:26Yeah, firstly, frankly, no, we haven't done that. I mean, our the way that we determined pricing was, you know, fairly unsophisticated, but I think this is pretty standard. When you're an early stage startup, you're basically just trying to get feedback from real paying customers, and you're not necessarily optimizing for price. So revenue, revenue is important for us. Of course, it is important for every business we could probably, you know, some of our customers are getting huge efficiency improvements from from our product, and they will value their time in the law firms. They'll be buying their time at 500 1000 $1,500 an hour. And so if they're able to get sort of 4050, 60% efficiency, it's pretty clear that they pay more than what we currently charge, sort of anywhere from 500 to $1,000 a month for our software. But you know, it's not necessarily something that we're sort of modeling or optimizing for at this particular stage. I do have a sort of rough ROI calculation that you do if you sort of make some assumptions about how many if we're talking about patent draft, in this particular case, any drafts do we think a particular person is doing? Year 1224, 36 how much they value their time, how many hours they spending on a particular application, how much they paying per seat. And you can kind of model out what the ROI multiple is. I think it's pretty clear that if you look across our customer base, and you look at some of the testimony of some case studies where people are reporting 40, 56% efficiency improved. Most of our customers are getting well beyond 10x ROI on the product. So I do think that there's room for increasing pricing. It's just not something that we've really optimized for at this particular stage.
Yeah, firstly, frankly, no, we haven't done that. I mean, our the way that we determined pricing was, you know, fairly unsophisticated, but I think this is pretty standard.

S Speaker 733:58Okay? And then the one of the other questions I have is, What do you think is your exit strategy? Because this is going to be a constantly changing space, right? Models will change, in which case you're going to have to tweak your customization that you're doing, and then you'll have different clients come on board which will have different requirements. So it's going to sort of go on right and in any, any sort of tool in the IP space, that's basically what the what the nature of the beast is. So what do you think is united strategy? Do you think it is that one of the laggers were big players, like anak boy and others that they want to acquire you? Or do you how do you view long term?
Okay? And then the one of the other questions I have is, What do you think is your exit strategy? Because this is going to be a constantly changing space, right?

S Speaker 134:44Yeah, I mean, we don't think about exit strategy at all. Our core focus on building a great business, build a great product that our customers love and to grow as quickly as possible. If you do that, if you build a great company, there'll be no shortage of exits. Whereas acquisition IPO building a sustainable company and so on. The way that we see it, IP is a huge industry, you know, over $150 billion generated annually from from licensing patents, $40 billion more than $40 billion spent just in the US on license, on litigating patents, 10s of billions of dollars spent on drafting and prosecuting to build up a portfolio. And of course, billions of dollars spent on R and D and passion. It's all about capturing some portion of value of the R D there. I think there's room here to build a huge software company. There are some legacy incumbents that you mentioned there. They're generally growing quite slowly. They're not actually that big at companies that maybe got one or $2 billion market cap, if we're able to execute on the vision on building all of these green field areas that we think we can and we're able to keep up or accelerate our growth rate, I think there's no reason why we couldn't either expand into those areas that those legacy incumbents are doing with sort of crm management and so on. It would make a lot of sense for us to offer sort of document systems inside of products. And actually, if we're growing a lot faster, our market cap would be some multiple of what theirs is. If we're able to get to, say, 500 million, a billion dollars of ARR, in a short amount of time, we'll have a higher market cap. Maybe we'll be the ones acquiring one of those legacy incumbents to get some of the distribution that they've that they've got. So it's not, it's not something we optimized for. The

S Speaker 836:18moment, Chris, can you focus on the go to market? And so what I mean kind of next, and I mean, just go over the things we missed on the minutes. So if there's anything missed, maybe on the team that we team members that we didn't mention. And I want to take the best out of these 10 minutes we have.

S Speaker 136:33Okay, awesome. Let me just run through the team. I feel like it's just probably the most important slide that we haven't been through yet. So the three, co founders, myself, my friend, Sanj and Angus. He's also rather so Sancho. We have a very technical team. Sanj and I both did PhDs, as I say, in AI and Angus. The CTO comes from background of software engineering. So Sanchez PhD at the Gatsby in it, which is a very prestigious research institution, part of ECL. It's where DeepMind came from, for example, during his PhD, he won awards at top AI conferences. After his PhD, he then went to go and work as an early employee at Magic Carpet AI he was employee night before that. It's a crypto trading startup. He worked there for about two years before it was acquired by blockchain.com He then spent about a year working@blockchain.com Before then leaving to found solving talent my brother, Angus, very skilled full stack engineer. After he graduated with a degree in computer science, he went to go and work at a hedge fund in London, and there he led a small team which built a greenfield trading platform which scaled to millions of trades per day. So he's very skilled about full stack engineer. And then I, myself, already mentioned at the beginning, did a PhD in AI, that's Sanj, and I also won some awards in top AI conferences and journals. So I think having that technical team has been we've got since hired patent attorneys, so we all had experience with the patent team process from the inventors perspective in academic institutions and R D companies that we've worked in. But I think having that technical background has been super useful for two things. One, it's been very useful for building the best product on the market. Building these products is non trivial. You do have to build out all these evals data sets. You have to build out these custom algorithms and so on. But two, the interesting thing about Panetta music is they often come from technical backgrounds. They all come from technical backgrounds, very similar to our say, they often have an undergrad, a master's often also a PhD subject, however, format specializing in patents. And I think having that kind of similar background has been super useful.

I was interested in, if you have done any analysis on the number of applications filed per year in the US, how many attorneys that does that makeup, and then what do you think the count of your competitors is, what? And eventually, obviously, that's where sort of the potential revenue gets to. I mean, testimonials are good.

We do have a full breakdown of everything I'm about to explain here, but you essentially want to build this platform that goes across the whole panting, process, harvesting, drafting, prosecution, litigation, etc. We started with drafting as the beachhead. There's a number of reasons for that. Firstly, completely green filled. Secondly, it's kind of the most fundamental problem. You're taking in an invention disclosure, you're comparing it to prior art, you're drafting out a high quality set of claims, you're reviewing the claims, you're drafting our specifications surrounding and so on. And really all the other parts, whether it be sort of responding to an office action, or passing invention or ultimately evaluating patent portfolios, build off that same kind of technology. So we want to technology. So we want to pick that as the Bucha. There around 110,000 patent attorneys globally. So if you just take our current product offering drafting prosecution, you assume that we don't build any more products, and that we don't increase pricing at all. There's over a billion dollars of ARR opportunity there. And then there are all these other areas that we're going to be expanding to. So invention harvesting, collect. We're going to start interfacing with the 10s of 1000s of inventors within these technology companies that we work with, freedom to operate, analysis, infringement, invalidation, proceedings, litigation, licensing and so on. We've got a breakdown of, you know, sort of bottom, top calculation of how we intend to sort of capture those markets, but we think there's over a $7 billion error opportunity in those

S Speaker 142:12Yeah. So on the litigation piece, one of our seed investors, Kevin Johnson from from Quinn Emanuel, he's quite big in the in the litigation space, and he litigated one of the biggest patents in US history. Got $1.1 billion in licensing revenue for Caltech, and he was talking us through the process of how he went about doing that. He went to Caltech, and him and his team spent six months going through their portfolio of 3000 families, and over that six months, they're whittling down the patents and identifying this one single pattern. So their process for doing that was basically evaluating the claims, to make a determination of how enforceable they thought each name was, and then weighting that by the potential commercial value, by scraping all these product specifications and competitors and and then comparing that to identify as one single pattern. And the reason why Kevin decided to invest in us. And the reason why we're also super excited about the potential for this kind of technology, for things like litigation so on, is that that whole six month process can, of course, be massively enhanced by using AI software that you just fundamentally couldn't have 18 months ago. And so what we want to be able to do is take our software that we've built already, it can, for example, you know, review a single set of patent claims, draft claims, review the claims and so on, and then apply that at scale to evaluate entire painful phase and identify what the most valuable patterns there might be by weighting them with commercial value in terms of what the actual business model would mean. There's a few different ideas that we have explained inside this document. We think that for litigation, there might be an interesting thing where you can have a sort of Palantir for IP kind of approach. But maybe you've got, you know, a sort of self intelligence, AI expert, a patent expert and a software engineer, so a team of three going to a litigation firm and then teaming up with the with the litigation firm to go into a company and try and identify opportunities for licensing. And then maybe you have a sort of even up style. So even UPS another legal tech company style revenue model, where you see description fee, but then you're also charging some kind of percentage of any licensing revenue that you're able to generate from a particular from a particular litigation case. So I think there's a number of ways in which you can try and capture the value that you're providing, but fundamentally, these are huge industries where there's not a huge amount of technology being used at the moment. We think they're right for disruption.
Yeah. So on the litigation piece, one of our seed investors, Kevin Johnson from from Quinn Emanuel, he's quite big in the in the litigation space, and he litigated one of the biggest patents in US history. Got $1.1 billion in licensing revenue for Caltech, and he was talking us through the process of how he went about doing that. He went to Caltech, and him and his team spent six months going through their portfolio of 3000 families, and over that six months, they're whittling down the patents and identifying this one single pattern. So their process for doing that was basically evaluating the claims, to make a determination of how enforceable they thought each name was, and then weighting that by the potential commercial value, by scraping all these product specifications and competitors and and then comparing that to identify as one single pattern.

S Speaker 144:42Yeah. Yeah. So short term, we're looking to hit ten million of annual recurring revenue
Yeah. Yeah. So short term, we're looking to hit ten million of annual recurring revenue
Yeah. Yeah. So short term, we're looking to hit ten million of annual recurring revenue
Yeah. Yeah. So short term, we're looking to hit ten million of annual recurring revenue
44:49within the next 16 months, and
within the next 16 months, and
within the next 16 months, and
within the next 16 months, and
S Speaker 144:53that's what we're raising series A for to really accelerate our accelerate our growth, and that's what we're going to be using to hit our series B. So to do that, we need to sell, you know, assuming no new products sell, around 800 drafting prosecution seats. It's around, you know, maybe 1012, logical first advisors, or maybe sort of 80 or so small boutiques, or combination of the two plus Italian dollars in the next 16 months. In the longer term, they call it maybe 345, years. We want to be the platform where all inventors in house teams and outside councils are collaborating across invention harvesting and drafting and prosecution through operating houses and plane charting. So that's what we want to be in an extra five years or so. And the series B is really going to be about accelerating a lot of that growth, expanding into those other areas, to do with licensing litigation so on.
that's what we're raising series A for to really accelerate our accelerate our growth, and that's what we're going to be using to hit our series B.

S Speaker 545:38So the 10 million AR, which is 5x growth from today. You said 16 months, but did I capture it correctly? 15 months?
So the 10 million AR, which is 5x growth from today. You said 16 months, but did I capture it correctly? 15 months?
So the 10 million AR, which is 5x growth from today. You said 16 months, but did I capture it correctly? 15 months?
So the 10 million AR, which is 5x growth from today. You said 16 months, but did I capture it correctly? 15 months?
S Speaker 145:46Yeah. So, I mean, I initially made this slide when we were initially raising the A, of course, now we're in there. We've actually done the first close of the A. So now this would be just about 60 months. So to get there, we need to point at least. I think it's 10 or 11% month on month, which
Yeah. So, I mean, I initially made this slide when we were initially raising the A, of course, now we're in there. We've actually done the first close of the A. So now this would be just about 60 months. So to get there, we need to point at least. I think it's 10 or 11% month on month, which

S Speaker 546:01by the end of this year, what's the target? AR, target end of 24 or 25 sorry, I believe
by the end of this year, what's the target? AR, target end of 24 or 25 sorry, I believe
by the end of this year, what's the target? AR, target end of 24 or 25 sorry, I believe
by the end of this year, what's the target? AR, target end of 24 or 25 sorry, I believe
S Speaker 146:09that you know, sort of extrapolating that model, it comes to about seven and a half million of ARR, so
that you know, sort of extrapolating that model, it comes to about seven and a half million of ARR, so
that you know, sort of extrapolating that model, it comes to about seven and a half million of ARR, so
that you know, sort of extrapolating that model, it comes to about seven and a half million of ARR, so
46:15many ARS today, or that's three months back. 2
many ARS today, or that's three months back. 2
many ARS today, or that's three months back. 2
many ARS today, or that's three months back. 2
S Speaker 146:19million was three months back, we're now at about 2.75 so two months back was two 2 million, and now we're about 2.75
million was three months back, we're now at about 2.75 so two months back was two 2 million, and now we're about 2.75
million was three months back, we're now at about 2.75 so two months back was two 2 million, and now we're about 2.75
million was three months back, we're now at about 2.75 so two months back was two 2 million, and now we're about 2.75
S Speaker 546:28okay, so end of last year was about three ish, COVID, right? No,
okay, so end of last year was about three ish, COVID, right? No,
okay, so end of last year was about three ish, COVID, right? No,
okay, so end of last year was about three ish, COVID, right? No,
S Speaker 146:31not three, sorry, two, yeah, just just under
not three, sorry, two, yeah, just just under
not three, sorry, two, yeah, just just under
not three, sorry, two, yeah, just just under
S Speaker 546:34two. Now you're the reminder. And then,
two. Now you're the reminder. And then,
two. Now you're the reminder. And then,
two. Now you're the reminder. And then,
S Speaker 146:40yeah, I mean, there's, there's a non zero chance that we actually grow a lot faster in this slide, and we hit 10 million by the end of the year. I mean, remember that, just inside our existing custom base with our existing product offering, if you just take the number of patent practitioners focusing on drafting prosecution, and you multiply the ones that we have to sell to you by what we currently sell a product for, there's over $30 million via our expansion just inside the existing customer base. So I actually think there's a significant chance that we accelerate much faster. Goal. This is just the high level sort of okay. If we focus on during at least 10% month to month, then we're going to be able to hit 10 million
yeah, I mean, there's, there's a non zero chance that we actually grow a lot faster in this slide, and we hit 10 million by the end of the year.

S Speaker 147:46Yes. So we, we were fortunate to receive, we picked a lead. We're raising 10 million on a 90 million post money valuation I sent over the term sheet earlier today. Yeah. So it's 8 million from the lead. It is 2 million allocation for follow ups.
Yes. So we, we were fortunate to receive, we picked a lead. We're raising 10 million on a 90 million post money valuation I sent over the term sheet earlier today. Yeah. So it's 8 million from the lead. It is 2 million allocation for follow ups.

S Speaker 148:12so we had the first close. Are you? We've done the first close? Yeah. So we're basically looking to wrap things up as soon as possible, because we want to announce the round latest by April 2. Okay, so first was what? When Chris, first place was done on the seventh of March, 7 of March, okay, and that's eight, yes,
so we had the first close. Are you? We've done the first close? Yeah. So we're basically looking to wrap things up as soon as possible, because we want to announce the round latest by April 2.
