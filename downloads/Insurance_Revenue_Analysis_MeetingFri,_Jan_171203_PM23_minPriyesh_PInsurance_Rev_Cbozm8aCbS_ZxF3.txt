============================================================

S Speaker 10:00It's shows up as premiums versus commissions. So it's earned premiums. Then we have the provisional Commission, which is the 95% that's left over multiplied times whatever the provisional commission rate is. And then we have fee income and other income, to the extent it exists. That's just the it's kind of the upside of the revenue. And then net insurance revenue is everything, but includes losses, includes agency commissions.

S Speaker 20:25Okay, so gross is roughly 22% of GWP.
Okay, so gross is roughly 22% of GWP.
Okay, so gross is roughly 22% of GWP.
Okay, so gross is roughly 22% of GWP.
0:31The calculation on that,
The calculation on that,
The calculation on that,
The calculation on that,
0:34yeah, 13 of 55 is around 20%
yeah, 13 of 55 is around 20%
yeah, 13 of 55 is around 20%
yeah, 13 of 55 is around 20%
S Speaker 10:39Yeah, so it should be whatever earn premium is, and that can go over more than one year, plus what our proportion, 95% of the City Commission.
Yeah, so it should be whatever earn premium is, and that can go over more than one year, plus what our proportion, 95% of the City Commission.
Yeah, so it should be whatever earn premium is, and that can go over more than one year, plus what our proportion, 95% of the City Commission.
Yeah, so it should be whatever earn premium is, and that can go over more than one year, plus what our proportion, 95% of the City Commission.
S Speaker 20:49Okay, so and understood. So I think it comes to around 20% and then the net revenue, the 5 million, sorry, five so, for example, 5 million. So it's not just the 12% agent commission, but there's bunch of other stuff that comes into it. And the biggest item, biggest item outside of the agency commission, is the is the provisional Commission, which is the 5% or
Okay, so and understood. So I think it comes to around 20% and then the net revenue, the 5 million, sorry, five so, for example, 5 million. So it's not just the 12% agent commission, but there's bunch of other stuff that comes into it.

And the biggest item, biggest item outside of the agency commission, is the is the provisional Commission, which is the 5% or
1:19that's, yeah, the 95%
that's, yeah, the 95%
that's, yeah, the 95%
that's, yeah, the 95%
S Speaker 11:2295% of the of the, whatever the written premium is, for anyone here, that's the provisional commission.
95% of the of the, whatever the written premium is, for anyone here, that's the provisional commission.
95% of the of the, whatever the written premium is, for anyone here, that's the provisional commission.
95% of the of the, whatever the written premium is, for anyone here, that's the provisional commission.
S Speaker 21:29Okay, got it. And so this is analogous to cross profit USA,
Okay, got it. And so this is analogous to cross profit USA,
Okay, got it. And so this is analogous to cross profit USA,
Okay, got it. And so this is analogous to cross profit USA,
S Speaker 11:35right? Yeah, that's, I mean, this basically based on the insurance operations kind of, what's, what's left over for us to cover expenses, okay?
right? Yeah, that's, I mean, this basically based on the insurance operations kind of, what's, what's left over for us to cover expenses, okay?
right? Yeah, that's, I mean, this basically based on the insurance operations kind of, what's, what's left over for us to cover expenses, okay?
right? Yeah, that's, I mean, this basically based on the insurance operations kind of, what's, what's left over for us to cover expenses, okay?
S Speaker 21:45Sorry, just to make sure I understood the provisional commission. So the provisional commission is out of the 13 million that you knew. Take out 95% of that as provisional commission.
Sorry, just to make sure I understood the provisional commission. So the provisional commission is out of the 13 million that you knew. Take out 95% of that as provisional commission.
Sorry, just to make sure I understood the provisional commission. So the provisional commission is out of the 13 million that you knew. Take out 95% of that as provisional commission.
Sorry, just to make sure I understood the provisional commission. So the provisional commission is out of the 13 million that you knew. Take out 95% of that as provisional commission.
S Speaker 11:58Yeah, so it would be the written premium for any one year times original commission rate times 95% should get you very close to that number.
Yeah, so it would be the written premium for any one year times original commission rate times 95% should get you very close to that number.
Yeah, so it would be the written premium for any one year times original commission rate times 95% should get you very close to that number.
Yeah, so it would be the written premium for any one year times original commission rate times 95% should get you very close to that number.
S Speaker 22:07Okay, and that's typically used to pay out the loss ratio. Is that? Why?
Okay, and that's typically used to pay out the loss ratio. Is that? Why?
Okay, and that's typically used to pay out the loss ratio. Is that? Why?
Okay, and that's typically used to pay out the loss ratio. Is that? Why?
S Speaker 12:12No. So the way the provisional Commission works is that they kind of fund our ability to operate and write business on their behalf. So the provisional commission, if you look at it just from an mga perspective, don't count any sort of insurance activity. That's what they give us to cover our expenses, including commissions that we pay to our agents. And so that's kind of separate. And then you have to think, so that's one the biggest component of it, right? That's the economic engine that drives the company, okay? The other 5% which is our own little insurance company, yeah. So you don't see provisional commissions for that, because would be sort of paying ourselves in some ways. So that's where you get earned premiums, losses and things like that. And so that's distinctly different. And then you combine them together to get to the net insurance revenue. Okay,
No. So the way the provisional Commission works is that they kind of fund our ability to operate and write business on their behalf.

S Speaker 22:59understood? So in a way, you got the gross at 13 in 2024 11 represents, I guess, 11 represents about 90. It represents about 84% in this case. And then you have the commission. Main issue is the commission expense, and what is GEP that's gross earned premium. Okay, that's okay. Got it understood? Priyesh, is that clear? Now for us, that
understood? So in a way, you got the gross at 13 in 2024 11 represents, I guess, 11 represents about 90. It represents about 84% in this case. And then you have the commission. Main issue is the commission expense, and what is GEP that's gross earned premium. Okay, that's okay. Got it understood? Priyesh, is that clear? Now for us, that

Main issue is the commission expense, and what is GEP that's gross earned premium. Okay, that's okay. Got it understood? Priyesh, is that clear? Now for us, that
S Speaker 33:27is clear. But Paul, at the same time, if I go to the Model tab and I go where you have reconsider the operating group, PNL details, the total revenue here for 2024 is different from both of the other numbers. So what is this and where is this coming from?
is clear. But Paul, at the same time, if I go to the Model tab and I go where you have reconsider the operating group, PNL details, the total revenue here for 2024 is different from both of the other numbers. So what is this and where is this coming from?
is clear. But Paul, at the same time, if I go to the Model tab and I go where you have reconsider the operating group, PNL details, the total revenue here for 2024 is different from both of the other numbers. So what is this and where is this coming from?

S Speaker 13:48So you're in the apparatus. I would go to the consolidated PNL. That's the best place
So you're in the apparatus. I would go to the consolidated PNL. That's the best place
So you're in the apparatus. I would go to the consolidated PNL. That's the best place
So you're in the apparatus. I would go to the consolidated PNL. That's the best place
S Speaker 33:55to start. So that's on the Consolidated Financial step you keep,
to start. So that's on the Consolidated Financial step you keep,
to start. So that's on the Consolidated Financial step you keep,
to start. So that's on the Consolidated Financial step you keep,
S Speaker 13:59as you guys now know, this is a 4000 lines arose. So if you keep up the bound, that's consolidated, that's the best place to look. The way this model was built way back when is it had like an operating group, and it had a holding company, and it has, I should say, and then an insurance kind of statutory entity. So the best place to look to get the financial detail is in the consolidated section. There'll be a consolidated consolidated balance sheet, and I can show you how to track through real quick if you want to see that. Right. I'm not the consolidator. I
as you guys now know, this is a 4000 lines arose. So if you keep up the bound, that's consolidated, that's the best place to look. The way this model was built way back when is it had like an operating group, and it had a holding company, and it has, I should say, and then an insurance kind of statutory entity.

4:51and I get, got it? Got it? One, okay, that's 322434, understood,
and I get, got it? Got it? One, okay, that's 322434, understood,
and I get, got it? Got it? One, okay, that's 322434, understood,
and I get, got it? Got it? One, okay, that's 322434, understood,
S Speaker 14:59yeah. And the best way to look at this for your if you have other similar questions, if you just go to the consolidated Financials tab, yes, this is where it all sort of comes together. And you can just literally see, if you go into the, you know, to any one of these things. So let's just pick out the 2024 grocer and premium 2,000,004 50 that tracks the I 37 in the sheet. So you just go down there, I 37
yeah. And the best way to look at this for your if you have other similar questions, if you just go to the consolidated Financials tab, yes, this is where it all sort of comes together. And you can just literally see, if you go into the, you know, to any one of these things. So let's just pick out the 2024 grocer and premium 2,000,004 50 that tracks the I 37 in the sheet.

So you just go down there, I 37
S Speaker 15:33that number, 2450, and then this will tell you exactly where the model, where in the model, it's coming from. So in this case, that number is coming from the model. Tab, column, Ev, row, 3795, understood. Yeah, it's just like, it's, there's a lot of like, linking that goes on. I know it's, believe me, when I first started, it's really, it's a big model, and it takes a while to get the flow of it. So I totally get it.
that number, 2450, and then this will tell you exactly where the model, where in the model, it's coming from. So in this case, that number is coming from the model. Tab, column, Ev, row, 3795, understood. Yeah, it's just like, it's, there's a lot of like, linking that goes on. I know it's, believe me, when I first started, it's really, it's a big model, and it takes a while to get the flow of it. So I totally get it.
that number, 2450, and then this will tell you exactly where the model, where in the model, it's coming from. So in this case, that number is coming from the model.

S Speaker 26:07Priyesh, can I ask my next question? Yeah, okay, the Priyesh, can I just go back to the first tab? Yeah, yeah. So Paul question on the one question on the assumption, what is seating commission,
Priyesh, can I ask my next question? Yeah, okay, the Priyesh, can I just go back to the first tab? Yeah, yeah. So Paul question on the one question on the assumption, what is seating commission,
Priyesh, can I ask my next question? Yeah, okay, the Priyesh, can I just go back to the first tab? Yeah, yeah. So Paul question on the one question on the assumption, what is seating commission,
Priyesh, can I ask my next question? Yeah, okay, the Priyesh, can I just go back to the first tab? Yeah, yeah. So Paul question on the one question on the assumption, what is seating commission,
S Speaker 16:27line six, that's that's probably better titled provisional commission. That's what it is, provisional.
line six, that's that's probably better titled provisional commission. That's what it is, provisional.
line six, that's that's probably better titled provisional commission. That's what it is, provisional.
line six, that's that's probably better titled provisional commission. That's what it is, provisional.
S Speaker 26:32Okay, got it. And then the
Okay, got it. And then the
Okay, got it. And then the
Okay, got it. And then the
S Speaker 26:45Sorry, not 19, yeah, 20 the 40% number. What is the driver of the contribution margin per policy to go from 23 to 40%
Sorry, not 19, yeah, 20 the 40% number. What is the driver of the contribution margin per policy to go from 23 to 40%
Sorry, not 19, yeah, 20 the 40% number. What is the driver of the contribution margin per policy to go from 23 to 40%
Sorry, not 19, yeah, 20 the 40% number. What is the driver of the contribution margin per policy to go from 23 to 40%
S Speaker 16:55yep, yep. So the driver is, and that's 40% in 2025
yep, yep. So the driver is, and that's 40% in 2025
yep, yep. So the driver is, and that's 40% in 2025
yep, yep. So the driver is, and that's 40% in 2025
7:01Yes, because we're just coming up now, yep,
Yes, because we're just coming up now, yep,
Yes, because we're just coming up now, yep,
Yes, because we're just coming up now, yep,
S Speaker 17:05yep. So the biggest driver is that, in 25 we dramatically reduce the telematics expense. Look on consolidated Financials tab, and it's there's a that'll show you all the component parts of it. But in 2024 we anticipate, you know, it's gonna be about $2 million in telematics, and that's basically, uh subsidizing cameras and things like that for the fleet. And we've uh curtailed that because cameras would be just more. You pick, you pick with us now. Yeah,
yep. So the biggest driver is that, in 25 we dramatically reduce the telematics expense. Look on consolidated Financials tab, and it's there's a that'll show you all the component parts of it. But in 2024 we anticipate, you know, it's gonna be about $2 million in telematics, and that's basically, uh subsidizing cameras and things like that for the fleet.

And we've uh curtailed that because cameras would be just more. You pick, you pick with us now. Yeah,
S Speaker 27:43yeah, go over to the right. Continue. Yeah,
yeah, go over to the right. Continue. Yeah,
yeah, go over to the right. Continue. Yeah,
yeah, go over to the right. Continue. Yeah,
S Speaker 17:46that's that's the biggest driver. So if you go over to the right tri column, Al,
that's that's the biggest driver. So if you go over to the right tri column, Al,
that's that's the biggest driver. So if you go over to the right tri column, Al,
that's that's the biggest driver. So if you go over to the right tri column, Al,
S Speaker 18:02that we're budgeting about half a million dollars called $400,000 telematics, as compared to 2 million this year. So less expense on a higher premium number.
that we're budgeting about half a million dollars called $400,000 telematics, as compared to 2 million this year. So less expense on a higher premium number.
that we're budgeting about half a million dollars called $400,000 telematics, as compared to 2 million this year. So less expense on a higher premium number.
that we're budgeting about half a million dollars called $400,000 telematics, as compared to 2 million this year. So less expense on a higher premium number.
S Speaker 28:13And that makes that huge difference. One and a half million does.
And that makes that huge difference. One and a half million does.
And that makes that huge difference. One and a half million does.
And that makes that huge difference. One and a half million does.
8:19Okay, okay, got it. So it's nothing else.
Okay, okay, got it. So it's nothing else.
Okay, okay, got it. So it's nothing else.
Okay, okay, got it. So it's nothing else.
S Speaker 18:21It's really a simple calculation. Yeah,
It's really a simple calculation. Yeah,
It's really a simple calculation. Yeah,
It's really a simple calculation. Yeah,
S Speaker 28:25okay, and it's now done. This particular reduction is done.
okay, and it's now done. This particular reduction is done.
okay, and it's now done. This particular reduction is done.
okay, and it's now done. This particular reduction is done.
8:30Yeah, we expect this will be the case in 2025
Yeah, we expect this will be the case in 2025
Yeah, we expect this will be the case in 2025
Yeah, we expect this will be the case in 2025
S Speaker 28:33okay. And because we are in 2025 so it's already started,
okay. And because we are in 2025 so it's already started,
okay. And because we are in 2025 so it's already started,
okay. And because we are in 2025 so it's already started,
S Speaker 18:36yeah, it'll gradually weigh in during the year. That's why we have some expense there. But if you look, for example, in the out years, so in 2026 it's down to, like, $30,000 so we're letting what the contracts run out during 2025 but the, you know, the plan is not to continue that be that expense. Okay, so that's a runoff, if you will. Okay, got it?
yeah, it'll gradually weigh in during the year. That's why we have some expense there. But if you look, for example, in the out years, so in 2026 it's down to, like, $30,000 so we're letting what the contracts run out during 2025 but the, you know, the plan is not to continue that be that expense.

Okay, so that's a runoff, if you will. Okay, got it?
8:59Okay? Priyesh, what else did we have?
Okay? Priyesh, what else did we have?
Okay? Priyesh, what else did we have?
Okay? Priyesh, what else did we have?
S Speaker 29:07We had the cash flow Priyesh, or we have it. Do they have any questions on cash flow?
