Alaska airline, they had an IP outage. So yeah, it's global and only funny, like a lot of flight from Hawaii to the to the to the mainland. US actually from Alaska airline and Hawaii airline, yes, but right now, like, I mean, like half of the flight can actually schedule normally for people who want to get out of Hawaii.

S Speaker 44:57I manage the US investments at Qualcomm ventures. We are strategic investment arm for Qualcomm. So we invest about one $50 million every year in sweet spot. Tends to be more like Series A, Series B for us, and then we do up to $10 million initial checks. That's typically how we function. And then we invest in areas that are strategically relevant to Qualcomm. And then, so, of course, there's many areas for Qualcomm. We sell a lot of art chips, of course, in smartphones and

S Speaker 45:41products for the cloud inference, and we have products for networking. We have products for variables. We have many like IOT and automotive or massive businesses. All these businesses are multi billion dollar businesses for Qualcomm. So we work with startups across the ecosystem to either in some cases, we become that customer. In some cases, they become a customer. In some cases, they become our partners, and vice versa.

6:10And yeah, I mean,
S Speaker 46:18we, I mean one of the key value adds that we want to provide to many startups that we invest in is, is enable some of these partnerships with the business units. Yeah, pleasure to meet you guys. And then we've been looking at this space broadly all the way from the clouds to arbitrage of GPUs, and are very curious about how what you're doing and how do you look at the space.

S Speaker 57:08Hey guys. Thanks Priyesh for the connection and Tosha, nice to meet you. I'm Johnny the CTO youth. Hello. My background is in HPC, high performance computing. Like back to 10 years I started after PhD, I started my career at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab as a HPC engineer and researcher. So basically, back then, I did a lot of work on like optimizing large scale pytorch Spark on supercomputer and working with a few professors from UC Berkeley, at that time, they have this amp lab. Now they have the skyline. So they've been involving, and I've been also involved in industry. After four years in the lab, I started a company on IoT, so basically building some intelligence into the edge sensor, security camera, and then, yeah. Over the last few years I spent, I worked at tick tock and Amazon. So building like a distributed NLP for tick tock and also foundation model for Amazon. I was the engineer lead for Amazon, Rufus building like building the foundation model from scratch and then all the way to IR and efficiency and inference deployment. So I'm the Rufus is like, if you go to amazon.com you can talk to it. It's chat. Is back end of the Amazon search now.

S Speaker 29:07Hi guys. This is Chris. I'm the non technical guy of Twitter labs. Before relapse, I was in crypto space for spending a half years there's one of the largest developer incentive platform called dorahats. Basically they hosted, they were one of the very first nonprofit organizations hosting hackathons, back to 2014 in China, and evolving to right now, the one of the leading global hacker communities. And I was doing business development partnership, a little bit of venture investment there, and I left door hacks by the end of last year's and joined the last team by early this year's. And right now, partnership and BD.

S Speaker 319:46for your customer? Yeah. So we have, actually, we have, like, our own, like small cup where we basically rent the GPU directly from the data center, and also, like a small colocation hosting team, so
for your customer? Yeah. So we have, actually, we have, like, our own, like small cup where we basically rent the GPU directly from the data center, and also, like a small colocation hosting team, so

you rank the GPUs from the actual you're not going to hyperscalers.
you rank the GPUs from the actual you're not going to hyperscalers.
S Speaker 320:10So the hyperscaler is more like if company would like to use our software solution and supply their own GPU. And then, like we goes, we go, we go there that we basically allow them to bring their own account or bring their own
So the hyperscaler is more like if company would like to use our software solution and supply their own GPU. And then, like we goes, we go, we go there that we basically allow them to bring their own account or bring their own

S Speaker 320:47I think, like most of them, are actually very focused on the data center side, especially for covid after, say, like, compared to them, like we have more like a snowflake versus AWS. Mm, that, yes,

S Speaker 421:25but so is it most, I guess, together now, because you know why they buy GPUs, right? Because it's five more GPUs, because one, you want to increase the gross margin, and then two, the demand is just so high that renting GPUs wasn't viable anymore.

S Speaker 526:05think a file is doing really well in in this aigc domain, we are like, trying to, like, be more like an infer friendly, and then be more flexible so that we can cover more use cases, not just a IGC, as you see, is the has huge demand.

They have a better support for their pipeline workflow, but our use case we are targeting is more broad, like inference. Inference can be different kind of like workload doesn't have to be argc. Can also be like traditional or like agent wise, Agent workflow, and then also IO training. And also is another huge demand, according like, when we talk to Nvidia, these they're observing, like the two huge demand is inference and post training, which is, RL,
