S Speaker 20:58know I've been using the Bay Area bridge background for quite a long time, so I figured it was time. I'm in. I'm based in San Mateo. That's where most of the fund is, but some members of the team are also in San Diego.

S Speaker 21:46absolutely, I have time, Ralph, I think I can do this till 220 I have something at 230 so before that, if we can wrap up, that would be great. And then looking to have this as an intro conversation down the line. Would like to involve a few more of my team members, if this this fits our thesis and the areas that we are looking at. But to start with, happy to give you an overview about Qualcomm ventures. How are we looking at this space where we have been in the entire AI investing ecosystem, and then would pass it over to you. Okay, so Ralph, I'm a Senior Associate here at Qualcomm ventures, been with the Fund for about a year and a half now, I particularly look at AI investing within the team, and I work with Tushar, who is the managing director at Qualcomm ventures. He has been with the with the company for about couple of decades now, ran a few businesses internally at Qualcomm, and has shifted to venture now for about 10 years. The fund itself, the fund itself, we've been around for 25 years or so, deployed more than $2 billion in capital, and have 200 plus active portfolio companies today, global fund. So we have offices across five or six different regions all across the globe, and in us, we very actively deploy capital. Typically aim to do about 150 $280 million a year out of Qualcomm's balance sheet, so we don't have external LPs, and that allows us to be more flexible in terms of being a long term partner, because we don't have mandates to return the fund or anything like that. Check sizes very quickly. Check sizes would be anywhere from two to $15 million we are two to $15 million yeah, we're typically a Series A investor, but in AI specifically, we have started doing seed rounds as well. We feel getting early, there's a lot of alpha and getting early, specifically, if we can add value to the company, and then that's broadly it, anything specific that I can answer for you,
absolutely, I have time, Ralph, I think I can do this till 220 I have something at 230 so before that, if we can wrap up, that would be great.

S Speaker 26:44quickly. Yes. So coming back to your point on our decision making process, to answer that very fairly Yes, we we are trying to ramp up the Silicon Valley speed, but we are not there yet. So typically, our process takes about three weeks or so. What it happens is I would like to in a follow up call loop in one of the partners at the firm as well, probably Tushar, because he is actively looking at AI and both of us, we have, we have spent some time in AI companion, voice first AI companion, to be precise. So one call with Tushar, if we decide to move forward, one management call and internally for us, we take a stake. We have an IC meeting. So the IC meeting, which we internally call as stage two, is where we have different geo leads come in, and we internally the I am leading the deal has to present to everyone. We have a voting process and post that we take few sign offs from Qualcomm. So, so it's a, it's, it's a process, I agree we have to go through compliance and legal, so it usually takes about three weeks or so, so that, let me just make
quickly. Yes. So coming back to your point on our decision making process, to answer that very fairly Yes, we we are trying to ramp up the Silicon Valley speed, but we are not there yet.

Ralph, so when I saw your present, it felt like, Yeah, I know what the space I would love to have a conversation with the guy, and we have spent some time here. So it does feel like we are well positioned, especially with our push in Edge AI, to sort of enable some of these technologies. But then would love to edge AI,

S Speaker 211:26the edge. For now, inference, yes, because I wouldn't say most of our chips have the capability of training a model on the edge, but inferencing, they can. And again, there is edge again for us, is not just on prem deployment of a data center or a GPU stack. Edge for us is having compute capabilities across all platforms, which is mobile PCs, variables, but

S Speaker 111:56all of those platforms, mobile PCs, you know, even watch the phones, all of those things exist on the edge, not talking about cloud. So we're not talking like, for example, serverless hosting. We're talking about consuming the GPU that exists on user devices. That's
all of those platforms, mobile PCs, you know, even watch the phones, all of those things exist on the edge, not talking about cloud. So we're not talking like, for example, serverless hosting. We're talking about consuming the GPU that exists on user devices. That's

S Speaker 212:18correct. Yeah. And to be frank, Ralph here, I don't think all of the models, all of the AI models today, and even even the models that you're working with, I'm sure you have a hybrid of a mixture of models, like you mentioned, not all of them would be able to run on edge. So we will have to start with an hybrid approach somehow, and then eventually look to port more and more models back on it as it makes sense. So that's how I've seen a few of our portfolio companies also approaching this. That seems to me viable, given the technology where we are today. Yeah,
correct. Yeah.

S Speaker 112:52I understand. Yeah. I just wanted to make sure I had a good, good understanding absolutely what you meant by edge computing and in addition, so the interesting, the other interesting thing is that was having our voice agentic AI

S Speaker 116:09right, meaning that you probably what just wants an executive summary, and then the meeting will be the deck, okay? And how quickly can you go from the partner to the venture meeting, and how long from the venture meeting to a decision. So I would say, you, can you put together the thing with tishar Next week? I will, yes, okay, so this is for next week. And then how long can is it? Is it reasonable that we can do the venture meeting the same week? I
right, meaning that you probably what just wants an executive summary, and then the meeting will be the deck, okay?

S Speaker 217:10About another week or so? Yikes, yes, yes, yes, that's what I was talking about. It takes us, like three weeks itself is something that would be on a fast track, given it would be an earlier round, and we don't have to go through the entire data room and do all of the diligence. Part. I'm saying three weeks itself for us is fast because, given this is a seed stage deal, we don't have to go through the data room. We don't have to do all of

Okay, you know, I mean, and, and one of my mentors, he actually, this is my fourth startup, as you know, my last startup, Mike Maples of floodgate was my primary VC, Jeff Epstein of Bessemer capital.

S Speaker 118:58if they're not sensitive on a cap or a discount. Yeah, right. So I imagine, if you do a safe, can you do, I say, with a discount and not a cat?
if they're not sensitive on a cap or a discount. Yeah, right. So I imagine, if you do a safe, can you do, I say, with a discount and not a cat?

S Speaker 219:08That would be difficult, but we can consider it, yeah, we would prefer having a cap on the run. That's typically most of the save that we have done, yep.

And, um, what is your Okay, no, I can guess the cap from the amount you're investing.
S Speaker 219:24All right, okay. And then, just to be clear, Ralph, you were initially thinking of 1.5 to five, and now you think it could go up to 20. Is that? Is that correct?

S Speaker 119:35I don't know, yeah, let me tell you, like, when people say things in words, it's really different than putting it down on paper, agree conversation with a major infrastructure provider that's really interested in us running all of our stuff on their stuff, and they quoted an investment they're just throwing out numbers and said, Yeah, we we're comfortable with 25 million. They're saying that because they're looking at how much compute we're going to use up in three years. Assuming, you know, tokens cost, what they talk cost. Now that's not going to be the case. Yeah, and they're just throwing out numbers, right? So I don't know whether they're doing that to try to get me, you know what I mean? So I don't know. So we expect probably to be in the center of your range

S Speaker 121:10you're thinking of. Yeah. So let me just, let me just normally say, normally, when we pitch, we try to pitch only the partners. Okay, right? And the reason why we only pitch the partners is because we had the message can get so mangled,
you're thinking of. Yeah. So let me just, let me just normally say, normally, when we pitch, we try to pitch only the partners. Okay, right? And the reason why we only pitch the partners is because we had the message can get so mangled,

S Speaker 121:33so that's what we normally do, but you are different because you sent me an email, and your email hit on the two things that we are most excited about, technically, okay, this makes me think you're not going to mangle it, that when you talk to Tushar, he's going to say sorry.

Yeah, I hope, so. I hope I'll do
Yeah, I hope, so. I hope I'll do
S Speaker 122:00justice to your vision. Yeah, Monday morning. Okay, so, so let me just say that the big thing the AI adapts to you, which means it listens, understands, learns, understands what's work it and adapt. Means it changes its personality. You know, it changes what it thinks is important. It's techniques, you know, to you, and it does this on its own, which differs dramatically. But let's say any kind of just have memory. And you know, you don't have this memory editing, put the stuff in and stuff like that. This is not memory. This is, well, sorry, of course, it's memory, because we're all AIS, just use context, right? But our context is managed by a set of other AIS, meaning that the AI that talks to you, it has, like different brain, like different inference centers to do different problems that control aspects of its behavior, right? This is a part of what we call a nexus of models architecture. It's not agents, right? Because an agent has a role, it has a task. It stays the same, and does that pass? Right? It might pass. An agent can talk to other agents, right? And an agent has a role of task. And this is not that. This is an artificial person, and it has different and its behavior spread over what we call our nexus of miles. Why is that important? Because the part of the artificial person that talks, it has to talk at conversational latency, because it has to get back to you somewhere between 650 to 1200 milliseconds. And if it does not, it doesn't work. So you have to fit inference. You have to fit transmission full duplex. You have to fit orchestration and you have to fit test to voice, all in that space of time, which means that whatever thinking I do before I talk this piece has to be in this fixed amount of time, but things you say to me might be sufficiently deep. I really need to think about that. And the crazy thing to the way our brain works. You have this part in your broker area that allows you to speak a conversational latency, but you know that this is something else going on in the back of your brain that says, I should not have said that, or this is what they meant when they said that. Yeah, we have that going on in situ, live. Now wait. How can that be? Since that's a whole bunch of information coming from different models, that's what that is, beyond agentic architecture. What I just described is beyond agentic architecture. In what way one is that you have dynamic orchestration based on information from the user that is constantly changing, and it has to affect not just what you say, but also affects the actual personality of the thing talking, right? Yeah, um, when you talk about the chatgpt, no matter what memory is, still chatgpt. I'm sorry, as an AI, I can't right, or it's sycophantic, and it's always do the next release. Yes, we've created something that is different for every single person. It's a world. It's not a character in the eye that has any number of characters. It's an infinite number of characters. N. Number of characters was worth? What was it? $1.8 billion or 10% Yeah, it's an infinite number of characters, where each character isn't set by us, but evolves on its
justice to your vision. Yeah, Monday morning. Okay, so, so let me just say that the big thing the AI adapts to you, which means it listens, understands, learns, understands what's work it and adapt. Means it changes its personality. You know, it changes what it thinks is important. It's techniques, you know, to you, and it does this on its own, which differs dramatically.

S Speaker 125:40exactly the entire personality? Socioeconomic, background, accent, gender, everything that you say that identifies as a person. But here's the most important stuff, stuff that you and I don't know identifies you as a person, and is it? Is it just like you? That's an important point, like, how that how is it that you know stuff that I can identify because you imply it in your conversation? A and B, most people don't know about it, B, C, we have the complete compendium of human knowledge in the AI center doing this inference. So it's creating data that you don't know to put in memory. It's doing it in a non agentic way, because it's not the same thing. Every time, all eccentric networks have to have X roles and evaluate the same way every time you don't have an agentic flow, if you don't have a score that consistently scores, yes, if this changes mind when it scores, this is beyond energetic interaction. And not only that, are all of the models that support personalities are embedded in a Institute Knowledge Graph, which is where all the information, all the behavioral knowledge. I don't even want to call it data, because if you look at points along points in this network, and look at the vector space created by each of these points, this is way beyond data. This is behavioral determinants. What I'm saying basically is that it's able to learn and adapt as a friend would, yeah. And the crazy thing is, that was what we had as an intention when we began to design it. When we got to a certain part in the design, we began to discover things about we began talk about how we think using our own terminology. You know, you change your delta, a things like that. So that means that you have a system, possibly for the first time, that is learning on its own, autonomously,

The Medicare vet school knows every private school that gets us to 15% of the 76 billion with two clicks, yeah, because this is so desperately needed, right? When you say, I have water and you've been walking for a long time in the heat, you'll take it. Having a good product it's not just okay. Look at this chart of check boxes. I have more checks markingly. This is nothing exists for them, and what does doesn't work right? They spent $5,000 a month per parent for half hour therapy, 27 months of waiting and first in a year, over a year before they can get that first therapy. That therapy is not sufficient. The kid needs something to happen. They need to work on saying please and thank you in a game regularly, as indicated by the parent, this is providing what does not exist.

And if you are actively not just sort of have, I don't know, as the infrastructure for developing a lot of these applications, like the like the Christianity agent that you have, but sort of go directly to the customer and own that consumer layer.

Is all the information we built up about how people react to things, whether it's innate working kid, that's all in our institute of Knowledge Graph. But even if somebody, if somebody, if somebody else, moves a model, we get a bigger model. We put that model in that graph, and that model becomes this much smarter, right? And that that data, we are the only ones that have it. Not only are we the only ones that had it, it's not, you're not like, if somebody steals your software, right, you got civil remedies, right? Depending on, you know, unless they broke into Window physically, you have to sue them, right? And they would feel like, okay, I'll just fight that in court. You know? You know they think they're gonna make more than those men in court. You know, they'll just make a bachelor decision to steal yourself. Yeah, they can't do that with ours, because it's not civil, it's criminal. You violated HIPAA by taking this information. So now we don't sue you. The Attorney General prosecutes you, Pierce's corporate trail, and your butt goes to jail. You don't just do a financial calculations, it's an
stay ahead of the competition. And then even this, let's say, let's say that you're wrong there, right? That there's somebody else who tries to do things. What is our mode?
