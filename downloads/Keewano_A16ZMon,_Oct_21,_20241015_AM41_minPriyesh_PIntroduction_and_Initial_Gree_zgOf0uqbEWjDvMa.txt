So in case, if that happens more, I think we can shift on a just voice based chat for now, but, yeah, absolutely, that sounds great demand. So I attended your presentation during the speed run, and that was pretty interesting. What really piques my interest? So I am in the team, and I focus on AI investments. We also have someone who particularly focuses on gaming, and then we have an Israel counterpart of ours as well. So we have a team in Israel as well. But I personally reached out because I love your positioning of how you're building an AI product manager. And maybe during the discussion, we would like to sort of understand that a little bit more as well. And then, to start with, maybe I can give you a brief introduction about myself, how we operate as a fund, what are our check sizes and investment areas? And then we can, I can hand it over to you. How does that sound?

S Speaker 25:46the on this gap that that is created, and it's just getting bigger and bigger and bigger between the analytic tools and the product and the needs of the product teams. And this gap is costing the studios. It's causing the industry, and it's, by the way, not only gaming, I will come to that that it is important my point, because you raised that as well. But this gap is hurting us more and more and more. And it costs studios, and it costs development teams millions and hours, but I will show you in a second. But first of all, let me show you who we are, so then it will be much easier to build why we are there. So me and Pawel involve. Both of us. Have three years in the gaming industry. I did most of the roles, executive roles in the industry, except for being the CTO Pawel was most of the time with me. He was like a small gap that he left to do unmanned drones. But

majority of the this time we work together,
S Speaker 27:11and we are coming from that problem. Like, until recently, I led the Israeli studio. Player is an Israeli company. I was playing for 15 years. I was actually first employee for playing, and I led the entire studio for playing for many, many years. So we come from the problem side, but there are two more people in the room, and one of them is here as well. So when we started working, we knew that it's deep to be market. We work for many years in the B to C market, but we have a lot of friends. And Mark happened to be my my really good friend, my childhood friend, right? It's embarrassing to say how many years we know each other, and as you usually do, you come with your friends and you ask them about the industry that you have gaps for. Maybe you think you have gaps and you just validate. And this is exactly what we did, market mentality. They worked, and this is actually the third company, but they already sold two previous companies from the world of sales and P and we come to them to show them the tech stack, what we are building how it works, how we gonna take it to the next level, how we gonna approach the market. And also, well, they sold two companies. We also asked them if they want to be dangerous, and after about a little bit more a week mark, called me and said, I got the counter proposition for you, what will guys enjoy? Yeah, so that was a happy notion for us, because it basically creates a team that has all the expertise, both from the world, like how the product, where the product and again, really strong. CTO and we have a team that is coming to the B to B market, SaaS, exactly how to deploy it. Sold successfully. You sold inside right? To translate that, one of the companies was sold mark. That's more of your stock. Yeah.

S Speaker 39:27Yeah, also the companies that we built, me and my partner, Vitaly Yeah, was both based in Israel. But once they acquired the acquired global companies, priyeshentes in the Austrian based company that also had headquarters in Austin, Texas. It's like a company that works today about $4 billion I guess, something like that. And so basically it's a corporate Yeah. So it was acquired by priyeshentes and but the development center, they left the Development Center here in Israel, so now they have also Development Center here in Israel. Yeah, one little thing that Dima didn't mention, that both like both of our like ventures, previous ventures come from the enterprise world, so we are familiar with infrastructure, enterprise products as well. Yeah, this is how we come together. Yeah. So
Yeah, also the companies that we built, me and my partner, Vitaly Yeah, was both based in Israel.

Yeah, this is how we come together. Yeah. So
S Speaker 210:24let me continue. So AI product manager, why? Because this is exactly what industry currently. We have analytics tools. They work brilliantly, but they do not solve the real problems. And you need somebody to tell you not where the problem is, for example, not to tell you that it's like there is a drop in Tutorial on Step six, or there is a churn on day three, or 50 people just purchase this offer, then you always have the next question is the why This question of the why it's a user of behavior. You want to understand what they made them do that either chore or monetize or whatever in between. But chore and monetization is usually the easiest way to do, and this is why, where we come with the mission statement the industry today, the chord goes up and up and up like I remember when we started working, you had retention day one, 80% 78% if your game was okay, you will have the day one was not a problem at all. And if your game was okay, you will do the money you will gain today. The CPI will probably see all the articles with the CPIs, they're going up and up. We're already in the 1000s of dollars, and in some cases even hundreds of dollars paid for user acquisition. The churn goes down, like everybody talking about like successful game is 40% between me new 3836 we constantly profit like say, now we are in the 40s. Yeah, it's real. And this question, what I just mentioned, of the why, cost us a lot of time. It cost us weeks in months for a simple question. And during that time, everybody working like I had me. Everybody were doing their a job, but at the end of the day they couldn't answer. It takes them a month to do something, meaning I'm seeking, I'm losing money. It didn't cost me money. The marketing cost me money. I can't stop marketing because it doesn't work like that. You can't stop it. Stop it doesn't work that way. So I still money goes down, and I'm just waiting for the answer, and not necessarily all the time you will get your rent. And there is new technology, yeah, a quick
let me continue. So AI product manager, why? Because this is exactly what industry currently. We have analytics tools. They work brilliantly, but they do not solve the real problems.

And you need somebody to tell you not where the problem is, for example, not to tell you that it's like there is a drop in Tutorial on Step six, or there is a churn on day three, or 50 people just purchase this offer, then you always have the next question is the why This question of the why it's a user of behavior. You want to understand what they made them do that either chore or monetize or whatever in between. But chore and monetization is usually the easiest way to do, and this is why, where we come with the mission statement the industry today, the chord goes up and up and up like I remember when we started working, you had retention day one, 80% 78% if your game was okay, you will have the day one was not a problem at all. And if your game was okay, you will do the money you will gain today. The CPI will probably see all the articles with the CPIs, they're going up and up. We're already in the 1000s of dollars, and in some cases even hundreds of dollars paid for user acquisition. The churn goes down, like everybody talking about like successful game is 40% between me new 3836 we constantly profit like say, now we are in the 40s. Yeah, it's real. And this question, what I just mentioned, of the why, cost us a lot of time. It cost us weeks in months for a simple question. And during that time, everybody working like I had me. Everybody were doing their a job, but at the end of the day they couldn't answer. It takes them a month to do something, meaning I'm seeking, I'm losing money. It didn't cost me money. The marketing cost me money. I can't stop marketing because it doesn't work like that. You can't stop it. Stop it doesn't work that way. So I still money goes down, and I'm just waiting for the answer, and not necessarily all the time you will get your rent. And there is new technology, yeah, a quick
S Speaker 112:54question there. Dima, so so far, that problem identification part has that always been very manual. And is it like people looking through the user journeys, trying to identify the solution kind of thing?

S Speaker 122:54sure, sure not. Yeah, absolutely. Thanks for giving me the time. This was really interesting team. I guess I would love to double click a little bit more on the database itself. And you mentioned that you're storing the data sets in a different way and then feeding that to AI more in a sense of a context window, rather than sort of pre training or fine tuning. It would love to sort of understand that better as well.

S Speaker 323:47basically, the idea was the database, as Dino mentioned, like, we don't building a database, right? It's not our goal. It's not our vision. For us, the database technology is just enabled to what we wanted to achieve, yeah, so we tried, you know, the traditional databases like Redis and SQL, SQL, MySQL, and like other key value databases and like click house and many different solutions like data lakes and others like snowflake and Other, right, you know, like big data infrastructure solution that aims to be like, real time, etc. It's even not not there, like, it's even not near the speed, the performance that we needed. And this was like the first enabler. So Pasha is a smart dude, is also low level developer. So he developed a design for a new database that we built from scratch, completely new way of storing data, and we actually store the data in the smallest part that the computer allows. They storing the data in bits, not bytes. Bits, for instance, if others store the data, like in the textual files, like, you know, XML, jsons, whatever they store data in piece. So first, the way of storing data is completely different, and how you populate this data, it's allowed also to populate the data very quickly, and the AI, as diva mentioned, running constantly, not we don't need to train the AI on data specific, on the specific data of the company, because, you know, you have different games, you have different Types of Data, different variation where the data goes through as through some process, the raw data goes through some process, and then the AI running on top of the process data, right? So this is how it works. So we're running some algorithms on the raw data, which is basically like user recordings. We record everything, every tab, every interaction, all the telemetry that can be you know that happening within your application? Yeah, and then we'll store it like layers. Imagine like there are different layers, then the data. The reason we need it to be populated in real time, because we need to populate all the data at once. And if you have 250 millions or a billion records, we need it immediately. And then the data go processed several algorithms running on them, and then the AI running on the process data to give you the insights. And this what allows us the to be more generic and not content specific. Otherwise, you will need to train your LLM on specific

S Speaker 126:56That's interesting. I make sense. Yeah, yeah, it does. It does at the top level, for sure, I would love to double down, double click on this in our follow up conversation, because this is very interesting, as what I imagined first, first up in my first pass was that you would need to record all of the video footage of the games being played, and that would have huge implications on latency. But seems like the way that you are doing it is solving that problem, which is very interesting. That's
That's interesting. I make sense. Yeah, yeah, it does.

But seems like the way that you are doing it is solving that problem, which is very interesting. That's
S Speaker 227:27where we started. Even, yeah, exactly the place that you are, it's a huge pressure on the games or applications as right on the process. So that's why we said not all of the technologies and understood that we need
where we started. Even, yeah, exactly the place that you are, it's a huge pressure on the games or applications as right on the process. So that's why we said not all of the technologies and understood that we need

S Speaker 127:43you understood that completely, right? I would love to understand a little bit also on the AI tech stack, what llms Are you using? What kind of data are you sort of fine tuning it on? Do you see down the line, as more people adopted. Is there a data layer that keeps on improving it, things like that?
you understood that completely, right? I would love to understand a little bit also on the AI tech stack, what llms Are you using? What kind of data are you sort of fine tuning it on?

Do you see down the line, as more people adopted. Is there a data layer that keeps on improving it, things like that?
S Speaker 328:07Yeah, so I start from the data, data part, yes, explaining the differential between us and to, for instance, tools like Mixpanel and amplitude. So in, I don't know like familiar with those tools, but in amplitude or mix panel for each event, for each tab, for each event that user agree, you need to supply about 10 different Parameters or Properties to describe this event, right? So it's not enough give like only the event name, but they require the other like analytic stores. Standard analytic stores require you to fill at least between eight to 10 properties one event, those properties are also includes like hierarchical properties, which is like, give me the of this button. Who is this parent window? Who is this parent window? Who is this parent like, layer, etc, etc, right? And this is required for those tools later on to because they storing the data in relational databases or some other like key value technologies, this allow them to build the queries more efficiently, etc, etc. In our case, always store in terms of event. It's only an event name, like one property. And why is that? Because we are constantly keeping the entire user journey, from the from the from the moment he starts with application again until the moment he ends. So this simplifies for us very much. It simplifies, actually, the LLM. It simplifies the work of the LLM, because now the LLM, if you familiar little bit, was, you know, LLM technology, as clear you give him, like, as low as the inputs you will give him, for him, it's clear to understand what's happening and make the conclusion. So we use a lot of noise, yeah, yeah. Top of that will also, will also collect some telemetry. And this telemetry as a metadata, is also stored in the database, and then once the AI is searching for specific pattern, you also, later on, mix and match it with some telemetry and and metadata to give you extra insights by trying to address the why question, for instance, okay, now I see this, this entire chair like of user journey. Now I able to group them and segment them. Okay, let's see what, what is this the common for those users? And then he starts to dig and understand that what is common for those users is that all of them coming from Japan and using 3g technology, yeah, for instance. And this is what causing the problem, in terms of what kind of llms we're using, we're not training our own model, yeah, for now, that makes sense? Yeah, we'll maybe we are, like, VPI starting to talk about it, but maybe it will happen. It's like, in a later stage, it's very expensive, yeah, and process, we're using standard llms, like, I don't know, familiar with tiny llama and other open source kind of previous version of GPT. So this is the machine learning models that we're using with some tweaks and adjustments for our needs.
Yeah, so I start from the data, data part, yes, explaining the differential between us and to, for instance, tools like Mixpanel and amplitude.

S Speaker 332:08Yeah, so Fiverr, actually, I spoke with, was one of the executives two days ago, and once they have, when they heard about us, they, they, they like bleeding users. They have this exact same problems every user that they lost or losing. They like B to B to C or something like that, like selling freelancers, etc. And they have quite complex flows as well. For like, a B to be application, they have a complex law because, like, there are many freelancers, and then you can do bids and you can do many it's not a linear, simple like tutorial application, and somewhere there they're losing users, and encounter the analytics team has a very difficult time to address and understand. Why? Also this question, why not that you're losing users? They can understand but digging all this data and what is also common to fiber and games, which is they also have a huge amount of users. They have like, millions users, like they don't have like 100k users per month. They have millions user months, and they create a lot of data, which is very hard to dig into that. And all they want, they just want to use their classic MVP version just to see those flows, to visualize, enable to like, use AI, just to address why user churning and where they have the opportunities. So basically the same use cases that diva mentioned with the boss and the sword, but maybe in a little bit different context of like, you know, freelancers and versus end users who are looking to engage them, etc, etc,
Yeah, so Fiverr, actually, I spoke with, was one of the executives two days ago, and once they have, when they heard about us, they, they, they like bleeding users. They have this exact same problems every user that they lost or losing. They like B to B to C or something like that, like selling freelancers, etc. And they have quite complex flows as well.

They have like, millions users, like they don't have like 100k users per month. They have millions user months, and they create a lot of data, which is very hard to dig into that. And all they want, they just want to use their classic MVP version just to see those flows, to visualize, enable to like, use AI, just to address why user churning and where they have the opportunities. So basically the same use cases that diva mentioned with the boss and the sword, but maybe in a little bit different context of like, you know, freelancers and versus end users who are looking to engage them, etc, etc,
Yeah, so Fiverr, actually, I spoke with, was one of the executives two days ago, and once they have, when they heard about us, they, they, they like bleeding users. They have this exact same problems every user that they lost or losing. They like B to B to C or something like that, like selling freelancers, etc. And they have quite complex flows as well. For like, a B to be application, they have a complex law because, like, there are many freelancers, and then you can do bids and you can do many it's not a linear, simple like tutorial application, and somewhere there they're losing users, and encounter the analytics team has a very difficult time to address and understand.

S Speaker 234:01I think you have to, you have to realize that from the product guys side and the studios and the executive side, because you already asked if there's tools like that that does that, but I know from your question that you know the answer as well. They're not. It's all manual. Because you, when you ask, you said, were you all doing that manual? Imagine that something that you're doing manual that cost you a lot of frustration time, and, you know, it's suddenly somebody comes to you and says, That's it. There is a tool. It's fast and it's not mental. It actually does what, what you need to do. This is why they all there, like, even if we're doing and giving them MVP at the beginning, they say, Fine, okay, let's start with the MVP, because they know where we can take it, and the ideas where we can take it are like crazy, yeah, because once you understand that we have those chips, and Mark mentioned that we have groupings now you start to understand where we can take it in
I think you have to, you have to realize that from the product guys side and the studios and the executive side, because you already asked if there's tools like that that does that, but I know from your question that you know the answer as well.

S Speaker 335:05the future. Yeah, even some, just to emphasize on that, some of our customers even talking like further, like they said, Okay, so if you can give me those instance in answers in real time, why you don't guide me in real time to the areas of opportunities, and instead of, you like, have a full development cycle of, okay, now I need to do ABC, you know, just give me an API and some somehow indicate me that here I'm leading users, but here is my opportunities, and I will navigate all my users to the opportunities,

S Speaker 135:40right? Yeah, that that is what I was thinking as well. Because right now, if the use case is focused on reducing churn, that makes a lot of sense. It's a big cost center, agreed. But down the line, you can also build engines around, how do you monetize? Well? How do you increase engagement? How do you make sure retention happens? Things like that pop up.

S Speaker 337:26from two VCs, one is the A, 16 Z, and the other is reimagined. And now, like, after the pitch and the demo, they basically were like speaking with VC to raise a seat, found yeah round. Sorry, we're looking to raise about $5 million in total. Not a big round yeah and but a six and Z and reimagine already told us that they also want to participate in this season. It will be less like to be we were looking for a check for 3.5 million or something like that, because they also

S Speaker 338:22Yeah? Like, yes. There's some pieces that, like, prefer to select small, smaller pieces that can write, like, a smaller check of 1.5 2 million Yeah. Or they're, like, as Dima mentioned, bigger one that don't mind. So got in mind, if it will be two VCs or one?
Yeah? Like, yes. There's some pieces that, like, prefer to select small, smaller pieces that can write, like, a smaller check of 1.5 2 million Yeah. Or they're, like, as Dima mentioned, bigger one that don't mind. So got in mind, if it will be two VCs or one?

Yeah. But it's so, yeah, so,
S Speaker 339:03like, according to the current dynamics, what's happening? We believe that someone we want to take a final decision somewhere by the end of the next week, got it. We have some traction, some good dynamics around it, yeah, probably this is those are for now those, those are the guidelines

S Speaker 139:25that makes sense, that makes sense, just from a corporate venture fund. Wise, the timing might be a little bit too tight for us, because we have all of the corporate processes compliance and things to take care of. But I would love to do a research, a little bit of research on my own. I would love to, sort of, if you can send me the deck, just go through it, have a chat internally, and then get back to you with a follow up conversation.

S Speaker 339:55yeah, I think that one of the things that we're also discussing, the reason that we, I think didn't like running first to finalize it, because we also want to choose Smart who will be our partners. And Qualcomm is like, it's not, it's not a small it's not a small company. You know, they recently put a bid on Intel, right? Yeah, there are some rumors that they want to buy Intel, right? So I have a lot of respect. Personally, I was using work in Intel once, okay? So I have a big respect for those, you know, semiconductors and and, you know, those, those kind of companies. So yeah, so we were choosing, like our partners, careful and driving very fast. We do want to finalize it by the end of the day, but if it will something that will make sense to you, just let us know, and let's see how it works. Absolutely
