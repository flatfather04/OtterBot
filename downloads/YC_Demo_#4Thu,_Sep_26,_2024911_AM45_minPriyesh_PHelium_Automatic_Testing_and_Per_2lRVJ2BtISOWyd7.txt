S Speaker 10:20And I worked in growth at Uber I made hundreds of millions of dollars testing better experiences for onboarding, checkout and to boost retention. And the problem is tech teams like mine were expensive and honestly, just slow aliens. AI makes money faster by generating and testing new in app experiences, starting with subscription paywalls for mobile apps we started selling four weeks ago, and we now power paywalls for millions of users across four customers. There are 1000s of companies like that representing more than a $2 billion market. And the exciting thing is, the more customers we bring on, the more our system learns. What works to build better software, faster

S Speaker 21:17praxis. Praxis automates operations or insurance process, this lets them ensure businesses close sales in one day instead of two weeks. My co founder and I graduated from Harvard with degrees in mathematics and computer science, and then went on to work managing risk. There we spend hundreds of hours reviewing and transcribing information from one place to another to insure other corporations. So now we're building the solution we wish we had. We launched three weeks ago, added 40k in ARR signed up to the top 50 brokerages last week. There are 140,000 nutrients brokerages in the US, each spending 60k a year on outdated software. That's an 8 billion Monica opportunity that we want to disrupt. We are praxis. Thank you.

S Speaker 42:44how often does my agent make a nutshell, and when did my agent manage? We launched the Hacker News four weeks ago, and it's now top five ICS 24 launch, and the most successful launch of any LM observability platform ever all three founding members of the team previously built infrastructure and observability at Ballenger, Bloomberg and Amazon. We are really close friends, and have known each other since high school. Our goal is to become the de facto platform which enables developers to build reliable and it's our critical ALM apps we align with that. Thank you.

S Speaker 87:22Hi. I'm Sammy, CEO of Henry. Henry builds deal decks in commercial real estate. 1000s of deal decks are built by broker teams on a daily basis. Brokers create decks to pitch and sell properties, showing prospective buyers and sellers what a building is worth and why they should buy or sell it. What you need to know is that building decks is by far the most painful part of the brokers workflow, and Henry automates the process end to end. We incorporated four months ago and have $124,000 in ARR from 10 teams at the largest brokerages in the world, including CBRE, Colliers and Newmark. My last company was in proptech. Raised $115 million and hit a ten million run rate. My co founder, most recently, managed a 30 person engineering team at a $3 billion company, and was the youngest engineering lead by five years. There are over 1 million cre professionals and charging $15,000 per seat. This is a $15 billion market opportunity.

S Speaker 1515:48Hi. I'm Lao Arjun. Defect tech allows creating the most realistic AI avatars on the market. You can clone yourself and generate full edited, engaging social media videos in minutes. I've created masterclasses and Tiktok videos for years, but production was a nightmare. In March, we went viral with Tiktok videos of Zuckerberg and Obama. 1000s of creators and brands joined our waiting list with the same pain. So we obsessed on building the simplest UI and tuned our model for more realistic avatars through features such as body language control. Now, after five weeks of launch, we've onboarded 2000 users and reached 100k Arr quelco, a YouTuber with 15 million subscribers, generates 1000 shorts per month with argil, he automated His channel's growth, and many will follow, because we're making video accessible and engaging. Oh, by the way, this was entirely generated with arg Thanks. APPLAUSE.

S Speaker 1617:06Hi, I'm Juan, the CEO of benchfi. Benchfi is a code retool that uncovers real bugs by rigorously testing code. We combine LMS with formal methods that, until now, are only used in mission critical industries such as aerospace and chip design.

S Speaker 1718:02We Hi, I'm Jaish. I'm the CEO of seluria. Seluri is building foundation models to simulate the Earth. We're starting with the weather. We are the team that previously built at Microsoft, the best AI weather model in the world, called Aura. Aura has been featured in nature Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal as one of this year's biggest technological breakthroughs. We started saludin Four months ago, and we have already built our own foundation model which surpasses Aurora capabilities. Our model is barely finished, and we already have $350,000 in loi from companies that need better weather for gas. We also have a customer already using us for improving their WiFi protections. Our model recently predicted the path of hurricane parallel three days before the US weather agencies, an early warning like ours, could have saved at least $3 billion from this $30 billion disaster. And hurricanes are just one type of event we can simulate. We are saluting. Thank you.

S Speaker 1819:28Hi, I'm Joe, and my co founder, Bailey and I are building ledger up an AI bookkeeper for startups and SMBs. Previously, scaling the nuances of bookkeeping was impossible. A human was always needed to categorize transactions correctly. But now, with our AI agents, 25 of our customers have completely replaced their human bookkeepers with us. Companies don't need to hire or outsource any entry level finance roles. We have 13 and a half k and m or R. We're going 50% month over month. Bailey and I have known each other since childhood, and Bailey's experience includes integrating open AI into Microsoft products, whereas I was previously a director of finance in a series a startup where I saw the problem. We're going up to the 1.4 million underserved SMBs in this market, and with our price point of $500 per month, represents an $8.6 billion market opportunity. We all ledger up. Thank you.

S Speaker 2022:09Hi, I'm Josh, the CEO of undermined. Undermined is a new kind of search engine. It's an AI agent that finds extremely complex information for experts, people like research scientists and doctors. It's not like Google, which quickly brings up a few approximate things. Instead, it's an AI agent that goes out and brings back to you exactly what you're looking for after a few minutes. From personal experience during our physics PhDs at MIT, we know the kind of value this assistant can bring. We have over 60k of ARR and we're growing 80% per month. This growth is almost entirely word of mouth, with individuals and teams paying for access at places like industry, biotech labs and investment firms. Over 50 million experts search for scientific research each month. We're building a narrow, super intelligence to solve their most complex, high value problems.

It's a full code editor that gives developers the AI features of cursor without having to send their code to cursor's API. Void lets you use any LLM provider you want more self host and LLM locally. We launched one week ago, and frankly, void kind of just took off in just one week. We got 5000 GitHub stars and over 1000 people joined the sport. We had books go viral on Hacker News, Reddit and credit. My co founder and I studied physics and computer science at wnell and quantum computer, former verification research at Johns Hopkins, APL, I think there's an opportunity now to book the most popular AI code editor in the world, and it's inevitable that that code editor will open source. Thank you.

S Speaker 2731:24Planbase is a workforce management platform built for modern healthcare, including credentialing, employee scheduling and payroll. You can think of us as rippling for healthcare. We launched three months ago and already have a paying enterprise contract worth 77k ACP to automate scheduling for more than 1000 doctors. Joe and I are both repeat founders at our previous startup, we developed AI scheduling algorithms used by over 1200 businesses and saving Domino's over 60 million in labor costs. But in healthcare, we faced a major challenge. Data siloed in scheduling systems and EHRs, requiring 1000s of hours to sync manually. Planbase solves this by providing a single source of proof the entire clinical workforce, which then makes it possible to automate processes by using AI. For example, we just reduced headcount of our first customer scheduling team by 70% and they already use it to generate their payroll headquarters, the perfect wedge to handle all payroll in the US, there are now seven admins for every doctor. Primebase is here to change that.

S Speaker 735:04Hi, I'm Otto, CEO of sensing. My co founder John and I met at MIT robotics, and we've been friends for the past nine years. We spent our careers building robots at places like NASA, Toyota Research Institute and Boeing. Now we're solving the biggest problem in robotics, data scarcity. In order to train the AI robots in the future, companies need tons of human demonstration data on passes like pin picking and closed folding to get this they perform expensive and slow teleoperations, which get them from zero to one, but can't fundamentally scale to generate the huge quantities of data needed in this space, sensei is the scale AI for robotics. We build low cost data collection devices and ship them to a large and diverse network of data collectors. Our best in class hardware enables data collection at twice the speed and a 10th of the cost of current methods, while our software stack supports the data collection ops, sensei provides access to the highest quality data collectors using the best data collection tools, outsourcing and scaling data generation are the keys to training the robot foundation models that will power the embodied AI era. Thank you.

Our team graduated together from the University of Oxford with degrees in biochemistry evolutionary to make four molecules that target two of the world's most lethal bacteria, a process that normally takes big pharma over two years. In fact, every molecule that we've tested to date outperforms the current standard of care. Antibiotics. We already have an LOI for a partnership opportunity, and our own first go to market indication is urinary tract infections. Why? Because every year in the US, there are 1 million people in a hospital with a UTI, and we can charge $10,000 per treatment, making just our first market over 10 billion we're going to develop treatments for every bacterial infection, meaning that we can prevent every possible future bacterial pandemic, and in doing so, create the next Genentech. We're of all very Biosciences.
