S Speaker 10:00And are you based here in the Bay or so? I'm over in Woodside. Ryan's based in Boston, but then we've kind of got a majority of our team and execs here in the Bay Area.

0:27Oh, yeah, no, it's,
0:30it's funny, like, I,
S Speaker 10:33anyway, I walk my dog there, you know, a couple of times a week. And it's fun, because I'm now starting to recognize a lot of like, VCs and peers are like, Oh, hey, you moved here. It's been a, it's a, that's good,

S Speaker 20:49yeah. So why don't we do we quickly introduce ourselves. I guess you've met Priyesh. And so I'll introduce myself, I'll tell you a little bit about Qualcomm ventures, and then I would love to learn more about yours. And so my background is in software engineering product and then so and then I've been with Qualcomm for my career. So I I lead our US investments team for Qualcomm ventures. And then so we invest in Qualcomm ventures. We invest in areas that are broadly speaking strategic to Qualcomm so and so. These change over the years. And then so, of course, so the areas that we are looking at right now are heavily aligned with, of course, AI is everywhere, so some of the new areas of growth for Qualcomm are one like, of course, like a large 75% of our business is still mobile, But the promise is that we want to be more than 50% of the business non mobile in a few years. And then. So there's a bunch of different vectors. And there's one business that's already growing pretty fast is the automotive business for Qualcomm. The other business that's growing pretty fast is the IoT business. And then, so those are still, these are bets. These are, like most of the business. We've got seven, eight businesses at Qualcomm, and most of these businesses are multi billion dollar businesses. But the idea is that going forward, there's a few new business lines, like, one of them is PCs, aipc. We think the future, PCS is going to be armed. So that's one bet. The other one is data center. So we just acquired a company. The news came out two days ago, company, alpha cents,
yeah. So why don't we do we quickly introduce ourselves. I guess you've met Priyesh.

S Speaker 12:53oh yeah, I saw that. Yeah, that's a very cool acquisition.
oh yeah, I saw that. Yeah, that's a very cool acquisition.
oh yeah, I saw that. Yeah, that's a very cool acquisition.
oh yeah, I saw that. Yeah, that's a very cool acquisition.
S Speaker 22:57So, but, but we've been at Data Center for six, seven years, and then so, so now we're going to get into another gear with data center inference chips, and then there's a custom CPU chip that we're building for the data center. So, so and then, so and then there's a few, quite a few other paths, like there's one XR and there's a bunch of other paths that do we have to build another set of multi billion dollar business so we so for Qualcomm ventures, we invest in areas that are potentially growth factors for Qualcomm in the future, and then. So how can we work with startups bring insights into some of the businesses that we're trying to grow, and then also work with many of these startups to where some in some cases, we become their China partners. In some cases, we become their customers. In some cases, we become their partners. And it can take multiple forms. So AI across the board for every single one of our platforms. AI is, of course, everything is AI at this point. And so we're investing heavily in enterprise, like, a lot of enterprise AI software companies we're spending a lot of time with. We've invested in companies like, like, a lot of infrastructure companies, so, you know, hugging face and scale devices and many others, anthropic and the likes and so and so we're looking to work with more Like, of course, agents is becoming the future, and so we're trying to figure out, how do we move a lot of the agent workflows to our platforms? And so that's where, yeah, that's the Yeah. Talk about others like. Not we can follow participate about like Most times we participate with others, and in some cases, in early stages, we do lead as well. We our check sizes are up to $10 million initial check size, $50 million every year. So we do about 10 deals. Have a million
So, but, but we've been at Data Center for six, seven years, and then so, so now we're going to get into another gear with data center inference chips, and then there's a custom CPU chip that we're building for the data center.

S Speaker 15:27questions. I could briefly introduce myself. And then Ryan, Ryan as well. And then, yeah, you can kind of steer us. How you best like to steer today. Kevin CO, Founder, CEO here. We've been at this since late 2023 before that was COO and CRO at vercel, a front end hosting company, went from zero to just 10 100 million when I left. Before that, worked at a machine learning company called dominant data, mostly focused on like large cap, enterprise, life sciences, intelligence, financial services building out there, like data science workbench. And then before that was a graph database company called the fridge, as very early employee, and yeah, based here in the Bay Area, right,

S Speaker 36:14sure, right. Good to meet you. Co founder, Head of Product Engineering and Design. Here prior was at astronomer, the commercial developer Apache Airflow, in the data engineering space grew revenue there from two to 30 million in three years. And prior to that, spent a decade at a trillion dollar asset manager, building and running the dev platform. And so I've seen dev platforms from a lot of angles and a lot of complex corporations, and so it's a lot more fun something into them than navigating them on the inside. But I got a lot of empathy for people to do on our on our customers.

Are you selling to that now? Yeah,
Are you selling to that now? Yeah,
S Speaker 16:56we were chatting with another investor. Hey, you know, like, how do you think about distribution in, like, the early chapters, company, company. Like, how are you gonna go and, like, penetrate these large enterprises? Like, what do you mean? Like, we, we've worked at them. I partnered with them for a decade. Like, this is the easy part. Yeah, our price building, you know, the zeitgeist around it, but

S Speaker 17:20No, I'm not a co founder, but I joined back in 2019 basically because, you know, the company is called site, because your mouth had started. It kind of based on open source project called next js, and then concurrent with the A with Dan Levine invested, basically like, Hey, you should, you should bring out a business partner, and I got to be the number two. And, you know, built out all the business, half of herself, so sales, marketing, finance, all the GNA functions. It was, it was a lot of fun. It was really cool. Cool, yeah.

big, so I guess, how do you like to structure it? And we're happy to show you product.
S Speaker 28:58Talk about the product and why you think. And then I've got a few questions. I'll tell you my broader question, my broader question space is the, you know, it's like the vertical versus horizontal question, which is, in this space of how like agent tech autonomy
Talk about the product and why you think. And then I've got a few questions. I'll tell you my broader question, my broader question space is the, you know, it's like the vertical versus horizontal question, which is, in this space of how like agent tech autonomy

over the next year, two years, three years, five years.
over the next year, two years, three years, five years.
over the next year, two years, three years, five years.
S Speaker 29:28What's going to win is it going to be people who know about certain vertical spaces, really? I mean, then right now, I mean, we've seen some examples of success in vertical spaces, like, of course, coding being being one, yeah. And then, even within coding, like, there's like, as you know, there's like, 10s of startups, and then everybody's sort of focusing on one Veg or one or two veg, and then they're drawing concerted concentric circles around it. And then there's a legal vertical, and then there's a high. Air, vertical. And then there's, we've seen successes over there. And then so the broader question that we have is, is there a way to build a platform, horizontal platform company, such that you're still able to provide enough value to customers?
What's going to win is it going to be people who know about certain vertical spaces, really? I mean, then right now, I mean, we've seen some examples of success in vertical spaces, like, of course, coding being being one, yeah.

And then so the broader question that we have is, is there a way to build a platform, horizontal platform company, such that you're still able to provide enough value to customers?
What's going to win is it going to be people who know about certain vertical spaces, really? I mean, then right now, I mean, we've seen some examples of success in vertical spaces, like, of course, coding being being one, yeah. And then, even within coding, like, there's like, as you know, there's like, 10s of startups, and then everybody's sort of focusing on one Veg or one or two veg, and then they're drawing concerted concentric circles around it.

S Speaker 110:18And I can give you my very spicy take, and then we, I give you more professional one too. But, like, my argument right now is, like, vertical AI platforms are, like, the geo cities of AI, where I don't remember this, like, back in, like, the the 90s, when we're like, I want to put boxed pizzeria on the internet. This is, this is the future of the web. Yeah. Like, you know, I think we're taking the blatant, naive approach, where like, for example, and if you're like So Brett Taylor, ex, co founder of many things, but CTO of Facebook, you know, like legend has this great riff on kind of the way in which like coding software is it's not, you know, he says it's not the last word, where the assumption is like, right now we're in the, like, Waymo era of CO pilots, where we're still taking cars and, like, bolting on a bunch of cameras, handing in AI and saying, like, this is a self driving car, And the future software is not going to be Python, right? Like, it seems silly. Why would you have a very ergonomic language that's easy to write when an AI is writing that doesn't care about the toilet system? And I think when you know with like, vertical AI software in general, I think it's like the like, obvious first step, kind of the hyper mode perspective is, like, English is the programming language of the future, and agents are the software of the future. And like, the thing you have to believe to think hyper modes an interesting company is large enterprises are still going to have an intrinsic desire to build their own software. And when I was I was talking to someone about Harvey. And like, you know, when you think of the ultra large law firms, it would be unreasonable to expect that Harvey is going to customize itself to fit, like, the very specific workflow of the partnership of Skadden versus, you know, you know, good win versus, etc, like they're like, at the largest end each enterprise. And I mean, this lovingly, is broken in its own way, and custom software is always going to be a part of that system. And so that's why I think, like, horizontal systems are going to be the thing that, you know, kind of unlock the creativity of, like the folks who know how the business works, maybe, like, you know, the heat of the universe, timescale,
And I can give you my very spicy take, and then we, I give you more professional one too.

So, I mean, of course, the Palantir story, but it
So, I mean, of course, the Palantir story, but it
So, I mean, of course, the Palantir story, but it
S Speaker 113:44also, I think, like, again, I a lot of my perspective ends up being like, like, the broken way people are building agents today is, like, you, you deploy data scientist, you know, sit Down with the, let's call it Process Engineer, Qualcomm, yeah, we're gonna build a bunch of agents to, you know, better better design chips. And that data scientist is interviewing that engineer who spent 25 years understanding how to build chips, and then goes away, tries to translate that into a bunch of code, and then comes back and says, I feel it's your agent that does your job. And of course, that energy is you've missed all of the nuance. Like, you know, when I talked about this, like, this is how my intuition is built that, you know, it should be x or y. And so I think, like the the services perspective, maybe they're agencies that you sell to do services like, that's kind of the science fiction version of this. But like the we think the healthiest pattern that, like, cover our ambition for the business is like, we want the subject matter expert to be the one to explain to the agent. Hey, you know what I'm thinking about. You know this PCB design? I know that this isn't going to work for these reasons, and like that context to be stored and learned by the agent over time, versus, you know, you. So this like translation between data scientists into code, into agent rinse, repeat. And that's, you know, again, we've, we've taken the like, version 0.0, dot 01, of that universe, but over a long period of time, like, that's what we think. You know this, you know the future, like agentic partners looks like,
also, I think, like, again, I a lot of my perspective ends up being like, like, the broken way people are building agents today is, like, you, you deploy data scientist, you know, sit Down with the, let's call it Process Engineer, Qualcomm, yeah, we're gonna build a bunch of agents to, you know, better better design chips.

S Speaker 215:26yeah. There's also the other, which is, there's two pieces of agentic automations in large enterprises, which is one that are core to the business. So for a company like Qualcomm, which is building chips and building software, those chips and and then the other one is not core businesses, which is customer support, which is
yeah. There's also the other, which is, there's two pieces of agentic automations in large enterprises, which is one that are core to the business. So for a company like Qualcomm, which is building chips and building software, those chips and and then the other one is not core businesses, which is customer support, which is

So for a company like Qualcomm, which is building chips and building software, those chips and and then the other one is not core businesses, which is customer support, which is
15:54it's, it's, it's core as and it's very

S Speaker 216:03that's right. So, that's right. So, so and you know, even everything else around Supply Chain Management and procurement and legal and everything else, all those areas are not core. So for for for those areas
that's right. So, that's right. So, so and you know, even everything else around Supply Chain Management and procurement and legal and everything else, all those areas are not core. So for for for those areas

S Speaker 116:25internally, like, It all tastes like chicken, like, you know, like, procurement should be somewhat similar in every business. Yes, you should use a vertical agent for that. Like, absolutely, that's why I think, you know, again, Brittany, more and more, Brett Taylor, you know, fandom, that's what I think. Sierra is a great business. Like, support is a great thing to, you know, we're already outsourcing it, like, you know, outsource it to an agent. But for the like, to your point, like the things that matter most to the business, like you're going to roll your own. I mean, you know, I mean, Brian is evidence of this, like he built this, you know, multi 1000 person fiefdom, building custom software for manual life drawing handbook, despite them not being a software company yet.

S Speaker 217:19how are you looking at the market? How is it? The other question that I had was, Okay, how's this different from the crew AIS of the world and, and how are you approaching this one? And like, what verticals and what not? Like initially, even though you're horizontal, but initially,
how are you looking at the market? How is it? The other question that I had was, Okay, how's this different from the crew AIS of the world and, and how are you approaching this one? And like, what verticals and what not? Like initially, even though you're horizontal, but initially,

17:41I mean, you got to start somewhere.

S Speaker 217:44Yeah, right. Like, so where do you see value creation?
Yeah, right. Like, so where do you see value creation?
Yeah, right. Like, so where do you see value creation?
Yeah, right. Like, so where do you see value creation?
17:47Talk about the runtime components.
Talk about the runtime components.
Talk about the runtime components.
Talk about the runtime components.
S Speaker 317:50Yeah. Like, maybe we'll kind of go in this order of, like, explain that the lower like, execution level, how we're different than career AI, and then our natural language experience, that kind of makes it more approachable in the market than we talk about like markets out of it. So at a fundamental level, and this what we built first, was we said, look, this is where things are going. These lightweight libraries to wrap models aren't going to be sufficient for where AI agents are going to be going long term, right? So when you look at like, the length chains of the world and crew is pretty similar, like a fresh take to link chain, but architecturally is actually very, very similar. Our belief is agents require a lot more than that. They were, they are a form of middleware in all of what ways of like the service layer, where they need to be stateful, right? They need to be taking scaling concerns off your plate. And so we approach that as a runtime. And so fundamentally, what a user gets from us is at runtime and an agent specification and code that runs on top of that, right? You can do customization of tools, but what it means is things like you can go to production immediately. You can scale up horizontally to 100,000 or a million agent instances very easily. It handles things like when tools fail, like those auto recovery processes of it, or the high availability of it, right? It just it being built as a intentional servers, server side piece of software. It approaches the world very differently, right? We thought about it a lot like my past with with airflow and data orchestration. This is an orchestration challenge, first and foremost, right? The coordination of models and tools and context and data and the user interaction and other agents that are participating is an orchestration problem, right? So we built that kernel to do that. It's built on WebAssembly. So it is incredibly lightweight. It has these nice characteristics of it that lend itself well to an actor model, which is kind of fundamentally what agents are where, if it's not working, it's been down, and it can be back up in two or three milliseconds, right? So we really build this in a way that it hits the form factor of an agent very well. It delivers a lot of just out of the box capabilities that match the agent take moment for that reason, and so that. Like, the key distinction between using that like, okay, crew AI also a code based framework. It has less of a runtime play, right? So there's a lot of things that they offload to other backing services you're responsible for making sure your database doesn't topple over. One of the number one calls we get is like, this worked in development. I put it in production and immediately crashed my database because it needs to do connection pooling. It needs to do some like, we've been here before, right? We've seen all these patterns before, but people forgot, like, Oh, this is an API layer and orchestration layer that solves that. So
Yeah. Like, maybe we'll kind of go in this order of, like, explain that the lower like, execution level, how we're different than career AI, and then our natural language experience, that kind of makes it more approachable in the market than we talk about like markets out of it. So at a fundamental level, and this what we built first, was we said, look, this is where things are going. These lightweight libraries to wrap models aren't going to be sufficient for where AI agents are going to be going long term, right? So when you look at like, the length chains of the world and crew is pretty similar, like a fresh take to link chain, but architecturally is actually very, very similar. Our belief is agents require a lot more than that. They were, they are a form of middleware in all of what ways of like the service layer, where they need to be stateful, right? They need to be taking scaling concerns off your plate. And so we approach that as a runtime. And so fundamentally, what a user gets from us is at runtime and an agent specification and code that runs on top of that, right? You can do customization of tools, but what it means is things like you can go to production immediately. You can scale up horizontally to 100,000 or a million agent instances very easily. It handles things like when tools fail, like those auto recovery processes of it, or the high availability of it, right? It just it being built as a intentional servers, server side piece of software. It approaches the world very differently, right? We thought about it a lot like my past with with airflow and data orchestration. This is an orchestration challenge, first and foremost, right? The coordination of models and tools and context and data and the user interaction and other agents that are participating is an orchestration problem, right? So we built that kernel to do that. It's built on WebAssembly. So it is incredibly lightweight. It has these nice characteristics of it that lend itself well to an actor model, which is kind of fundamentally what agents are where, if it's not working, it's been down, and it can be back up in two or three milliseconds, right? So we really build this in a way that it hits the form factor of an agent very well. It delivers a lot of just out of the box capabilities that match the agent take moment for that reason, and so that. Like, the key distinction between using that like, okay, crew AI also a code based framework. It has less of a runtime play, right? So there's a lot of things that they offload to other backing services you're responsible for making sure your database doesn't topple over. One of the number one calls we get is like, this worked in development. I put it in production and immediately crashed my database because it needs to do connection pooling. It needs to do some like, we've been here before, right? We've seen all these patterns before, but people forgot, like, Oh, this is an API layer and orchestration layer that solves that. So
Yeah. Like, maybe we'll kind of go in this order of, like, explain that the lower like, execution level, how we're different than career AI, and then our natural language experience, that kind of makes it more approachable in the market than we talk about like markets out of it.

S Speaker 221:05I think, yeah, that does make sense. And then so, so at this point, I guess so. Then are you also thinking of building communities? Because, you know, like Lang chain and crew, aI have gone hard at building communities. Yeah, it's about whether those communities will translate to production. Because I don't know that. I mean, the reviews so far, when I ask developers about Lang chain is even today, people like, Okay, well, I don't want to use it. It's not in production. It just doesn't work. And then I think, who was
I think, yeah, that does make sense. And then so, so at this point, I guess so. Then are you also thinking of building communities?

21:47the curse? Pretty popular.

the curse? Pretty popular.
21:51I've heard good reviews about,
I've heard good reviews about,
I've heard good reviews about,
I've heard good reviews about,
21:54like, development camel. Yeah, there's
like, development camel. Yeah, there's
like, development camel. Yeah, there's
like, development camel. Yeah, there's
S Speaker 121:58the two things I'll say on a community. I think one, if done well, in a flywheel to your business can be really unfair customer acquisition advantage. I mean, I've looked at it at Neo for J I lived in Purcell's product called D graph, which is really popular graph database. It's got, you know, 50,000 active clusters, and we get a bunch of LEAP flow from it. I think the thing that I think people often screw up is they think that community is the business and not just a like, yet another channel that you use to grow. Yes. So I think short answer is yes, we're going to continue to try and build community. It is probably like, I'll call it like, third on my list of like, how do I get unfair distribution, customer acquisition part of it, for example, I think one of the great reasons why we're chatting and we're talking to workday ventures and sftc, or, sorry, Salesforce ventures, and like all the other corporates, is like, I want to go get distribution say, hey, like all of you, are deeply concerned about having you know, Again, if you believe that the future software is agentic, you're worried about your software getting ripped out by agents. Here you go. Here's a mechanism for you to get agents built and deployed on target for your your stack. I did this ever sell to a lot of success is, is we partnered up with a lot of folks that had a extrinsic threat to their business. For example, a big commerce was watching Shopify and Toby just crush their business, and our first million dollar deals came through big commerce, walking us into their largest enterprise. Customers. Be like, here's how we're going to retain you. You're going to deploy under settle. And my hope is to do that where, you know, workday is watching this and saying, Hey, we've got this amazing system of record, we've got all this great data, but everyone's trying to figure out how to actually manage an agentic, you know, HR platform. Maybe that could be us. And so, like, that's kind of the that's P zero for me, I'm like, How do I have unfair distribution where, you know, my dream is, you know, when Harris finally wakes up to the fact that there's a lot of revenue and enterprise for light chain, you know, I already have incumbency all the way across the global 2000 you know, and so anyway, like that, that's kind of the approach that we're taking. Okay,
the two things I'll say on a community. I think one, if done well, in a flywheel to your business can be really unfair customer acquisition advantage.

Okay,
S Speaker 224:18let's and what's the Kevin like, how did you? When did you stop? Let's see, were sell scale like, was it 02, 100?
let's and what's the Kevin like, how did you? When did you stop? Let's see, were sell scale like, was it 02, 100?
let's and what's the Kevin like, how did you? When did you stop? Let's see, were sell scale like, was it 02, 100?
let's and what's the Kevin like, how did you? When did you stop? Let's see, were sell scale like, was it 02, 100?
24:32It was like 400k to 200
It was like 400k to 200
It was like 400k to 200
It was like 400k to 200
S Speaker 224:38but so what was like, what got Marcel going?
but so what was like, what got Marcel going?
but so what was like, what got Marcel going?
but so what was like, what got Marcel going?
S Speaker 124:45I will say this is a very honest answer, like you're doing a lot of stuff in the early days of a company, like you're taking 100,000 shots on goal, and exactly what tipped you over is kind of hard. I'm sure some HBr articles will say, Oh, Kevin decided to do this. This was. Reason why. But so the first thing we ended up doing was actually, like, looking at, like, pricing and packaging, which is, like, it's a funny thing to say, is like one of the first inflection points, but like, we went trying to figure out we have this large, you know, open source community, no enterprise revenue, no let's go see if we can just even, like, is there is an appetite to buy. And that was kind of the first tick where we end up getting the Washington Post and Airbnb is like our first couple of enterprise customers. The second one was actually like understanding the problems of deployment in that, in those, those organizations where, and this is where I think there's like a data flywheel advantage that we're getting that a lot of other organizations aren't, because, you know, we have two federal customers already in production, because we have ZS and Associates. Is like this, like global, 2000 pharmaceutical brand already. Like building with us. We talked to Airbnb like, I don't use next js. I don't ever plan to host on you, but this is how you change my business. We now use these deployment previews as the new way in which our team understands a new website that we're building, new page that we're building, you know, during COVID, when they were briefly, I'm trying to figure out, you know, what is, what is Airbnb, 2.0 look like, you know, Brian, you know, the CEO over there is looking at next year, vercel preview deployments and like, that's how they make decisions. And we leaned in really hard afterwards, and we started becoming workflow come in, like, that's where develop preview shift came from. Was that conversation and like, we're going to be looking for those mechanisms, like, Okay, what like, for example, they've learned very recently is there's a huge politicization of agent adoption at the highest levels in global 2000 where I am the chief customer officer and I run the support desk. I am not super enthusiastic about agents where, you know, functionally, I think about head count as the definition of success. Where, you know, I manage a 4000 person support organization. I don't love the idea that I'm being slashed to 1000 and I need to do just as good. And so how we deploy agents and work with those organizations is going to be different than, for example, when you talk to any like, profit center, you know, bu leaders, you know, sales team on fire, let's go agents all day. You didn't talk to marketing, you talk to engineering. And so like, these are, like, the things are gonna give us, like, meaningful advantages as we start to shape the product and drive for these, like, enterprise functions,
I will say this is a very honest answer, like you're doing a lot of stuff in the early days of a company, like you're taking 100,000 shots on goal, and exactly what tipped you over is kind of hard. I'm sure some HBr articles will say, Oh, Kevin decided to do this. This was. Reason why.

And so how we deploy agents and work with those organizations is going to be different than, for example, when you talk to any like, profit center, you know, bu leaders, you know, sales team on fire, let's go agents all day. You didn't talk to marketing, you talk to engineering. And so like, these are, like, the things are gonna give us, like, meaningful advantages as we start to shape the product and drive for these, like, enterprise functions,
I will say this is a very honest answer, like you're doing a lot of stuff in the early days of a company, like you're taking 100,000 shots on goal, and exactly what tipped you over is kind of hard. I'm sure some HBr articles will say, Oh, Kevin decided to do this. This was. Reason why. But so the first thing we ended up doing was actually, like, looking at, like, pricing and packaging, which is, like, it's a funny thing to say, is like one of the first inflection points, but like, we went trying to figure out we have this large, you know, open source community, no enterprise revenue, no let's go see if we can just even, like, is there is an appetite to buy. And that was kind of the first tick where we end up getting the Washington Post and Airbnb is like our first couple of enterprise customers. The second one was actually like understanding the problems of deployment in that, in those, those organizations where, and this is where I think there's like a data flywheel advantage that we're getting that a lot of other organizations aren't, because, you know, we have two federal customers already in production, because we have ZS and Associates. Is like this, like global, 2000 pharmaceutical brand already. Like building with us. We talked to Airbnb like, I don't use next js. I don't ever plan to host on you, but this is how you change my business. We now use these deployment previews as the new way in which our team understands a new website that we're building, new page that we're building, you know, during COVID, when they were briefly, I'm trying to figure out, you know, what is, what is Airbnb, 2.0 look like, you know, Brian, you know, the CEO over there is looking at next year, vercel preview deployments and like, that's how they make decisions. And we leaned in really hard afterwards, and we started becoming workflow come in, like, that's where develop preview shift came from. Was that conversation and like, we're going to be looking for those mechanisms, like, Okay, what like, for example, they've learned very recently is there's a huge politicization of agent adoption at the highest levels in global 2000 where I am the chief customer officer and I run the support desk. I am not super enthusiastic about agents where, you know, functionally, I think about head count as the definition of success. Where, you know, I manage a 4000 person support organization. I don't love the idea that I'm being slashed to 1000 and I need to do just as good. And so how we deploy agents and work with those organizations is going to be different than, for example, when you talk to any like, profit center, you know, bu leaders, you know, sales team on fire, let's go agents all day. You didn't talk to marketing, you talk to engineering. And so like, these are, like, the things are gonna give us, like, meaningful advantages as we start to shape the product and drive for these, like, enterprise functions,
S Speaker 227:23and so now then, what, like, where, which ones are you? Which?
and so now then, what, like, where, which ones are you? Which?
and so now then, what, like, where, which ones are you? Which?
and so now then, what, like, where, which ones are you? Which?
27:28Oh, verticals, yeah,
S Speaker 127:34we candidly, like the ones we've ended up with, I'm not sure we're going to Katie scale against where we're seeing a lot of financial services, but they just really struggle to buy where, you know, we're talking like, Blackstone, and they're like, hey, look, we feel like we need to do this internally, but we really want to do them like, there's just auction around, like any regulated industry, life science has actually been phenomenal for us, because they have similar complexity, but not the same level of regulation. Obviously, healthcare is no way HIPAA is too hard. But drug discovery, drug manufacturing, that's been great for us. And then a lot of what I'll call like lovely businesses. So really, really large services firms, we found, are very excited about this. Where there can't fit in time, materials, we can fit solutions, and we use agents to do it. Where there's kind of all gy, mid size staffing company, where they do, they provide like resources for all of the AI labs. And what happens is they say, oh, I need to provide 1000 data labelers today. I need to pull, you know, and then, you know, next month at zero, and it's 500 and then it's zero. And so they're trying to build this digital workforce to try and one survive two, start to move toward like a software, like margin structure. And then within those organizations, sales is one of the easiest ones that you always land with. You talk to a salesperson, and they're so excited about agents, sales, ops, marketing,
we candidly, like the ones we've ended up with, I'm not sure we're going to Katie scale against where we're seeing a lot of financial services, but they just really struggle to buy where, you know, we're talking like, Blackstone, and they're like, hey, look, we feel like we need to do this internally, but we really want to do them like, there's just auction around, like any regulated industry, life science has actually been phenomenal for us, because they have similar complexity, but not the same level of regulation.

S Speaker 129:25Told me, like, where they're running 17 projects, and like, the VP of platform was like, we're gonna put zeros in production. I was like, Oh, I don't know if they know
Told me, like, where they're running 17 projects, and like, the VP of platform was like, we're gonna put zeros in production. I was like, Oh, I don't know if they know

S Speaker 229:35that. Yeah, exactly. So, which is most of them right now, I think POCs might like a lot of it, because I think people say people like these AI systems can be pretty good at financial services today, but I think the sales and then at the same time, then I don't know if these financial services are perfect. What they're going to do, will versus buy and all that. Right? Uh, and then the other verticals you mentioned, like the legal verticals and this, and sales verticals and all those that, like those. There's a lot of vertical solution providers. I
that. Yeah, exactly. So, which is most of them right now, I think POCs might like a lot of it, because I think people say people like these AI systems can be pretty good at financial services today, but I think the sales and then at the same time, then I don't know if these financial services are perfect.

30:45framework, an example of
framework, an example of
framework, an example of
framework, an example of
S Speaker 130:47this. So maybe, right? There's a quick nuance that I think is it is worth calling out. So for example, I think, like, Lindy, for example, is a great sales vertical, like agent builder, they're going directly the VP of sales, like, Hey, here's Zapier for selling with AI. Go for it. We're going to solve your flows. We tend to approach more through the side door, where I'm reaching out to the head of data at pick a company at Under Armor, right? And I'm saying, Hey, you're probably being told we need to be aI native. You're probably running Lunch and Learns with every business unit trying to figure out where agents get deployed. And I bet you're tearing your hair out because it's really hard. It's really time consuming, and the quality of agents isn't that great, and vigorously not. They say great. Here's what we're going to do. You set up hyper mode, determine that what tools, what MCP servers? What level of access, what level of privileging should a salesperson's agent have great once you've set the bounding box, let's go talk to that sales leader again and say, Hey, maybe you love lending. Maybe you don't. But here's a equivalent tool that is blessed, that you can use, and the comfort for the data organization is they can then whenever, let's say, our seller builds this really great agent, or we want to embed it somewhere, they can extract that as code. They're not trapped in the like web flow WYSIWYG How do I build my agent experience? At any point they can say, oh, you know what, I can't quite get the behavior I want out of this agent. Let's go and pull that out. And then suddenly I have, again, like discrete code that I can say, oh, temperature up this. Hey, this is the failover. I want to handle connection pooling this way. I want to handle scaling this way. And so, like, it is much more of like, like a professionals tool. And so that's what we see as we partner with the data team and then go sell the sales together.
this. So maybe, right? There's a quick nuance that I think is it is worth calling out.

Yeah, you see, I'm comparing this with,
S Speaker 233:00you know what we saw, and it still exists in large enterprises. Mid market, up market is every CIO, every CFO, every CEO says, You know what? I think this thing is going to reduce OpEx. I think this thing is going to increase

S Speaker 233:27and I want you to stop hiring, and then I want you to start using these AI tools. And here in the budget for this,
and I want you to stop hiring, and then I want you to start using these AI tools. And here in the budget for this,

33:35AI already got budgets to deploy, and
AI already got budgets to deploy, and
AI already got budgets to deploy, and
AI already got budgets to deploy, and
S Speaker 233:39then at that point, once you've got those budgets to deploy, there's different teams internally. Teams try to build these themselves, but they're in heavy pressure from the CIO CEO to show results. What ends up happening is what I've seen. This is correct. Whenever they try to build in house, it takes much longer they're not able to show the results. Go build it, and then then, essentially, the decision maker is that, you know, just go use whatever is out there. So I've seen this over and over and over again, and that's where, that's why you're seeing like these, some of the vertical will do Yeah, so, but then, and then the data teams that you're talking about, like the data teams are trying to convince node we can build this, but they're not able to show like these data teams are still, even with using external tools, they're not able to show results. So how do you and then, so they're able to show the results as good as the vertical ones. Then, of course, it's lower cost, and then more control. The biggest thing, I think the biggest reason that I've seen with most teams is like, more like the CIOs are mostly worried about losing control. It's losing
then at that point, once you've got those budgets to deploy, there's different teams internally. Teams try to build these themselves, but they're in heavy pressure from the CIO CEO to show results.

S Speaker 134:55control. And then, like, when you actually think about, like, you know, remember, like the data side. Low issue of, like, the early 2010s like recreating this issue, where it's like, each each team has their own agent platform. Like it then becomes insane. Like, we'll actually really want the CS agent talk, and like, you know, it becomes and they say, Well, what agents have access to? What PII and it's insane.

That's a good point for sure.
That's a good point for sure.
S Speaker 135:20Oh yeah, for sure. But I think part of again, like this is where I think the the vercel DNA really starts doing out like, I think people undervalued How great, you know, llms or agents are at building agents. And you know, again, you guys can have access right after this call, and in 10 minutes, you can build your first agent that's doing real work for you. And I think that's how we kind of get that twinkle gun for folks, where they're like, oh, I can still move fast, and I still get the centralized platform. And like, again, like, if we're right, this is our, like, very pointy stick where, you know, you go to that data like, hey, you've been getting yelled at Aha, and, yeah, it's terrible, you know, like AI is awful for me. And that's, again, it's progressive, progressive complexity. Where, like, our free tier is a personal service towards, like, authenticate into your calendar, and I'm gonna give you, give you data prep, or, sorry, your daily calendar prep, and you can ask questions about it. Where, like, you know, I can I can, I can even show you what I did right before this, like, you know, I did my quick prep for you all and, like, in and so I literally was like, okay, you know, I do, like, my quick meeting prep here I'll give away. Okay, hey, I'm meeting the Qualcomm team. And then I, you know, say, you know, as you're chatting, hey, here the strategic elements. And, like, Oh, hey. Like, based on the latest information, you know, what's most strategic Qualcomm, and I'm able to, like, just start again, like, this is a an agent I built in like, four minutes. They're just, you know, on a daily basis, I can end up coming in here and saying, hey, you know. And then they'll say, okay, you know what date you want me to do meeting prep for, oh, July 13, June 13, whatever day of this event. And then it'll essentially run the same thing. It'll crawl my calendar and give me meeting prep of like, who I'm gonna be meeting with the next day and like. So this is, like, your free tier, and so you can immediately start getting a little bit of value out of like, not only am I a little bit better prep, but it can, like, create my agendas for me and all this stuff. And then you then say, Okay, now what's the next step? Okay, well, actually, I want you to listen to my sales calls and automatically populate my CRM, cool. You know, just ask the agent. And, like, people have underweighted how great these systems are at building these things, and they think they still need this, like, deterministic voicey way to give if this, then that, then you hand it to an LLM if it's nonsense. And so again, like you actually play with it, like, you know, you know, I say a lot of words clearly.
Oh yeah, for sure. But I think part of again, like this is where I think the the vercel DNA really starts doing out like, I think people undervalued How great, you know, llms or agents are at building agents.

S Speaker 139:40funny. One of the things I, you know, you've been saying to investors, like, Hey, by the way, like, even though I'm an ex CRO and I am all about, you know, making money for the company, I'm going to be looking for a partner who wants to win the war with me. And a lot of what we've been doing is this ultra low drag sales motion where I'm like, hey. What is the minimum procurement process I need to get through for you to, like, actually start installing this and using this. You know, we do unlimited and then we do a true up in three months, and we do a performance obligation, like, what's easiest way for you to buy from me? You know, our head of suka, Andrew McNeely, built out sales at x. We were together back at Domino, and very much in the like, I don't care what ACV is, I want to deploy these. That's some of our customers need to spend real money to, like, actually procure. And so we've got like, four customers over 80k and Arr, and then we've got a lot of just like, deployed enterprises that are, you know, a couple 100 bucks of consumption as they're, like, building out their first flows individually, and they're starting to close enough to their seasons.

got it, got it, okay. And then, so you're looking for leave for this. You're calling this series A Yeah, okay, got it, got it. And then, so the plan for this year from financial, so this, this, let's say, a $15 million raise, will you planning for how much time.

S Speaker 142:23It's an interesting debate we have. I don't see depending on how profitable we can be, like, it's a funny thing that like, now, like, post AI, they're like, I don't know, mindful, you know, I don't, I don't feel like I need a lot more to do this. Yeah, you know, I'm going to call it like, goal is infinite runway, reality. Let's call it 24 months, um, you know, realistically, I'm hoping to end this year at call it 3 million in top line. And then, you know, depending on hiring plans. Once we hit four, 5 million in ARR, like, you know, depending on hiring like, we're very profitable. You know, again, I'm going to choose to grow fast over be profitable. But it's, it's weirdly in reach.

S Speaker 243:07Well, I guess this is a high margin, gross margin, which, this is, what, 90% gross

S Speaker 343:22we, we should be able to get it to 90 plus percent. I mean, our the like, low code, natural language side on, the agent runtime is priced at like 98% Yeah, like, we have a lot of pricing power there. As we go lower in the stack and go more to hosting, we start to ratchet that back a bit. But, yeah, I think we've had a wet a lot of levers there and like, that's at 98% before any savings plans or financial optimizations with AWS, right? So I'm quite confident that as we get to a certain point of scale, obviously, there's some fixed costs to get started on the infrastructure side of things and support and things like that. But to Kevin, the point we should do a lot of that with agents like, we should be able to maintain about the 90% margin.
we, we should be able to get it to 90 plus percent. I mean, our the like, low code, natural language side on, the agent runtime is priced at like 98% Yeah, like, we have a lot of pricing power there.

But to Kevin, the point we should do a lot of that with agents like, we should be able to maintain about the 90% margin.
we, we should be able to get it to 90 plus percent. I mean, our the like, low code, natural language side on, the agent runtime is priced at like 98% Yeah, like, we have a lot of pricing power there. As we go lower in the stack and go more to hosting, we start to ratchet that back a bit.

S Speaker 245:53I think, like, the value with us would be also under So, but yeah, he sees what the value a lot of the startups that we're investing in this space, that they're seeing is we take them to customers so distribution, which is, all you need to do is make sure some part of this runs on the ad PC. We take you to financial institutions. We take you to legal institutions. We take you to, oh, like large and small enterprises, and there's obviously, like, Qualcomm as a customer takes longer because of the procurement cycles, but there's that too, so yeah, but that's a and then we sort of have to get over the hump of, you know, Microsoft co pilot like, it's crappy, but, like, No, all of us have it.

Like, hey, who can I, who can I write on the back of to get this stuff deployed, and getting deployed onto the aipc should work like we have a local experience that you can build and deploy stuff on.
