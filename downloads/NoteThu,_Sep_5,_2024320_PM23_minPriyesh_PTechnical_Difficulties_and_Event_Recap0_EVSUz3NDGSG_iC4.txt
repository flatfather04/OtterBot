S Speaker 10:15I totally agree, man, like the joke internally has been, how bad Microsoft has fucked up the entire chart GPT system. We talk about it quite a lot, yeah, but like, same with the teams, it's, it's something we use internally, but I should switch to zooms. I think the team has bought zoom subscription, so we should be changing soon. But anyway, how has the event been? I'm sorry I could not make it there in person, but I heard the event went well.

S Speaker 20:44I have to say that it's very well attended. A lot of a lot of networking. This first time I use this matchmaking app, I think it works. It's logical. You know, you you end up speaking to people with which there's a good come match to begin with. It's kind of, it reminds me a little bit like, like a dating app

it's got that kind of like logic, efficiency to it absolutely,
S Speaker 11:12absolutely, I kind of wished it connected to my calendar so that I could have just set up the meeting there, but I had to reach out to everyone with a specific link, and then set up a meeting. But anyway, glad we could finally connect. Here we are, yes, yes. So Eduardo, would love to know more about what you're building. I did take a very brief look, so I have some understanding, but would love to understand from your perspective on how you are thinking about it, and where can call complain this entire space. And in that process, if you would like, I can give you an overview about myself and the fund here and how we look at things, and then we can take it. You can take it over from there, yeah, of course,

I've worked with the World Bank United Nations, building similar tools Boston, who's co founded the world's first political risk platform that was crowdsourcing 800 writers globally. He's based in London and in the Gulf in Doha, and then John is our CTO. He's got 15 years experience with Bloomberg, innovation, Discovery Networks, building back end service performance, but also he's pioneered a lot of these generative AI applications. So that's the concept of a nutshell. Any

S Speaker 27:13That's That's a great question, and I should have started by by clarifying as an anthropologist, so I like to think of myself as an anthropologist that has been a terrorist in the world of AI for a few decades. So I've been using AI as an anthropologist. So the social science is something that is very important. I appreciate you asking that precise question. Essentially, we have a team that it's with 5050, social scientists, anthropologists, linguists, area experts, political scientists, and the other half is data scientists, agentic, AI experts, general AI experts. And we have partnerships with Columbia University's Data Science Institute where I teach, I suspect, on AI and conflict prevention. So we have this privileged Partnership, which we work with PhDs and postdocs on the tech side. But it's all about, in my opinion, it's all about marrying the domain knowledge, it's a local understanding of the population with the technology. And I mentioned I built these tools before, and I've led a pretty big team that's working with the World Bank and UN to build these tools. And I always make the point of making sure that we have the social science part covered. So the way that it works is that the social science will create templates for the data science teams to work with, so we will be able to say, okay, so if we're building up,

S Speaker 28:45in New York City, and we're looking at Queens. Queens is very diverse ethically, yeah, you can't just, you know, say, All right, let's replicate Americans. It's, it's a rich environment. So we have to create layers. Okay, this is the population. These are the demographics of the population. These are the this is the psychological, cultural, social, political profile of these different demographic cohorts. And then the key ingredient, really is if we had these agents interact with a dynamic information environment, so what are these agents reading? What would a typical person of this demographic cohort interact with? What social media websites like,
in New York City, and we're looking at Queens. Queens is very diverse ethically, yeah, you can't just, you know, say, All right, let's replicate Americans. It's, it's a rich environment.

Yeah, so we have a iterative and automatic process that uses a historical data to ground truth behavior.
S Speaker 210:01then we'll pair them with a real person, and we'll monitor the real person's behavior over a certain amount of time, and then we'll ask the agent the same questions, and we'll see how divergent the answers are from those questions, and then we'll use that iteratively to continually refine the llms so that the responses are as close as possible to truth. Obviously, it's not going to be like one to one matching. And I should also mention that we're not really matching to actual citizens because of privacy and regulatory concerns, but we're creating personas. So there's a typical persona of this demographic cohort, but that demographic cohort very specific and

S Speaker 211:00The fact that I've been working in this field for many years means I have relations with data providers. So I built other startups, and we did social listening in very difficult environments. I built some AI tools that we did political forecasting for the World Bank in the Democratic Republic of Congo in Kenya and Ukraine. So I've worked with data sparse environments and and I also have relations with data providers. Of course, you can't just like go to Facebook and get the information there. You have to work through different data markets. So I have all those pipelines in place. The skill is just a matter of taking a template, making sure that our social science team is monitoring the application of this template to the new geography, and then opening up all the I like to think of it as opposed like the pipeline you just open the faucet. So it kind of asks for say something that is a little bit exotic, but maybe something Latin America or Asia, we would just open up that faucet that we have already in place with the data provider to adjust data from that to the state of geography. Now, there are places in which you have to also do some synthetic data, and we have some techniques in place in which we use similar populations and then fill it in with some assumptions that are always bended by Arts and Social Sciences, that's

S Speaker 112:24pretty that's pretty interesting. Eduardo, so if, if I were in layman, I'm just trying to test my understanding of the entire process here, if I were in layman, would it be fair for me to say that, effectively, given that in a fair world, everyone has access to these data sources. You are building a layer which would allow people to query demographics, in a sense, yes, interesting. There are some very

S Speaker 113:45I'm curious why, why did you choose governments as your target market? I understand there's a strong founder market fit, and for sure, you can sell in that market. But I can imagine there could be, like you mentioned, social listening. I can imagine there could be a lot of use cases for brands trying to test their products. Focus

S Speaker 114:11product feedback loops, things like that. Why did you explore any of that? Why not that segment? The

S Speaker 214:19first response is, if that's what we're experts in. So you want to live or you're an expert. There's similar outputs doing this in the consumable space. Yeah, for example, like, if Colgate has a new toothpaste that's peach flavored, how do consumers react? And you ask your agents,
first response is, if that's what we're experts in. So you want to live or you're an expert. There's similar outputs doing this in the consumable space. Yeah, for example, like, if Colgate has a new toothpaste that's peach flavored, how do consumers react? And you ask your agents,

S Speaker 214:39the consumable space that, and I'm glad they're doing that. In fact, I'm happy to learn from what they're doing. So the first short answer is, we're experts here. We know it. We're domain experts. The second answer is that we have relationships already in place. We're in the process of doing market research report, which we're getting a feedback surveys, letters of intent, of intent,

S Speaker 215:35these would charge a monthly subscription anywhere between, say, five to $60,000 a month, depending on and there's some, there's some near competitors. Again, this is a new market, so there's not, there's there's no competitors. Definitely not in our space. We're the first ones. But I've looked at near competitors for similar data providers, data as a service, sort of companies, Data Miner or pre data, they do just kind of social listing. So we give you, like a report and monitoring what people are saying online around certain entities or certain products, and their subscription goes from 5000 to 60,000 we're very keen on hearing back from our clients and what they would take one thing that we are hearing, and I think makes sense, is that everybody wants us to sort of fly below the procurement open bid process. So if you're you're not like $300,000 and government agency doesn't have to go through a public like, 30 months posting so they can quickly just buy your product. So I'm thinking something like that. So between, say, five to $50,000 depending on how many digital services you want,

S Speaker 218:09We're finishing the market research, and it'll be done in November. It's quite a it's not just like a market research, and we've just outsourced it to some market firm. We're actually doing like a serious academic study. So we've got the academic research. There's quite a lot of the published in academic journals about these technologies. So we have it because I'm academics, I'm coming to it from a very structured perspective. So we have the literature, we have the responses from the market participants. Again, we've reached out to 500 plus folks from governments, multilaterals, but also in the private sector, also the strategic communications sector. So we're getting feedback from as many people as we can. And once we have that market research report, we're going to put it together in a pitch deck you can go, go to folks like yourself and see who can be our partners.

S Speaker 119:04Absolutely sounds good. So from now till November, I guess the milestones are this market research, and are you also working on building out the product, the platform? Till then?

S Speaker 219:17Yes, yes. We, as I mentioned, we already had everything in place, but we have one digital citizen. Once, what will be done with this will know better exactly what this digital citizen needs to do and how much we should price it. Once we have that information, then we're looking to find pre seed investors at around 500k to build out the prototype, and they just treat what we call pioneer clients, which are those folks in government and will drive organizations that have subscribed to potentially pay for this product.

S Speaker 220:53Yeah, that makes total sense. And in fact, I went to this conference really to create relationships, because I think you know you have to build trust over time. So I sort of, I want to get in early and start to, you know, have these face to face conversations. We're not in any big hurry. We want to do this properly. So this makes sense. Is there an email that I can send you some like that concept note? Or how can we be in touch over the next few months?

S Speaker 121:37And something for our fund specifically, which is very useful is if you can give us some information about how you are going about building that tech stack. Qualcomm, as you can imagine, is a very deep tech company, and we really like to evaluate the entire tech stack when we make investments. So that would be very interesting to learn as well, whenever you have it, not whenever you have it. It's not, not a compulsion for now,

S Speaker 222:03yeah, that makes sense, yeah. And we can also continue this conversation once we are at the scene and maybe Series A round, I learned today, there's this, you know, there's different stages, and there's people that focus on pre seed. Also, there's family offices. We have some strategic investors. My partner boss, is very connected to that world. So we might, we might, you know, build, build this up a little, and then continue our conversation more formally,

S Speaker 122:34for sure. Eduardo, I think let's, let's have a follow up conversation sometime around November as well, I might be able to be able to connect you to few of my, few of the accelerators here, or some pre seed investors who might be excited about the space.
