S Speaker 10:00Let's get started with network ocean.
S Speaker 20:15Hey, my name is Sam. I'm the CEO of network ocean. Network ocean builds underwater data centers to cut 30% of power usage through free cooling underwater, we operate GPUs cheaper and more sustainably. Over the past five months, we built our full scale, one megawatt underwater Data Center, which houses 512 GPUs and can make ten million per year in GPU cloud revenue. This vessel is going underwater in the bay for testing tomorrow. We need this now, because there's been a massive shift in the power density of the hardware inside of the data center, namely, these GPUs, which now require liquid cooling. This is an established trillion dollar industry, and with our current vessel, we have 30% better margins than online data centers, which is defensible through our physical infrastructure. This is why we have $2 million in Lois to reserve compute in this vessel over the course of next year. Network ocean is here to expand humanity's capabilities in the oceans, and that starts with building and operating the most efficient AI data centers in the

S Speaker 42:50Rez, hello. This is rez, the CEO of cart. Ai, we built customizable AI, sales assistance for E commerce companies. You might have seen that Amazon recently launched Rufus, an AI conversational shopping assistant that's everywhere on their website. Every retailer now wants the same technology, and that is what we enable. We are engineers from Stanford and CMU. We've done ML and AI research at Jane Street, Susquehanna, snap quote here, and Nvidia. We've even worked on ml for ecommerce at Tiktok, where we saw the workings of an E commerce operation that makes over $7 billion a year. We just launched two weeks ago, and have already closed three customers worth $5,000 in MRR. One of them is a mid market e commerce company with millions of dollars in GMB. We believe, just like every SaaS website has an intercom widget, in the future, every e commerce company will use cart AI. Thank you.

S Speaker 1212:55Hey, I'm Brooke and I'm the founder of COBOL. COBOL is a simulation and evaluation platform for autonomous AI agents. I was previously an engineer at Waymo, where I led our evaluation infrastructure team and engineered many of our simulation systems from the ground up. Our founding engineers did LLM evaluation research at Berkeley and Stanford. We're already at 11k MRR in just six weeks, our 10 customers use us because we save them hours of time otherwise spend manually testing their systems. Instead, we run large scale simulations in CICD, similar to self driving cars, autonomous agents are difficult to test because they must navigate and respond to a changing environment over a period of time. This is a massive opportunity, valued at over 86 billion in just the next three years, every single enterprise will adopt autonomous agents for tasks large and small. COBOL is the applied intuition for testing these AI agents. We will enable enterprises to trust their agentic Task Force. We are COBOL. Thank you. Applause.

S Speaker 1314:09Hi, I'm Varsha, the CEO and co founder of offstream. We are vanta for carbon compliance, just as every single SaaS company gets soft to compliant to unlock enterprise sales. Every single industrial project developer, from solar to data centers, needs carbon compliance to unlock revenue. Today, those project developers spend $21 billion on services and labor to manage compliance. We build software with llms to automate this. We've booked over 500k in ARR with 11 customers, and grew over 50% month over month. This summer, I struggled through carbon compliance myself as the strategy lead at Indigo AG, where we spent $50 million and hired 80 people to be compliant. My co founder, Zach was a founding engineer at a YZ startup for hedge fund admin, where he built their product from zero to a million in ARR we are offstream.

S Speaker 1415:18Hi, my name is Ankit, and the CEO of androgen. At androgen, we genetically engineered bacteria and use AI design enzymes to make polymers like fuels and plastics from the air. Think soligen, but for larger, more complex molecules, and we use carbon dioxide instead of sugar as our feed stock, molecules like fuels, plastics, cell, gloves, starches, each of these have massive, hundreds of billions of dollars a year of markets behind them. In fact, most of you watching from home are probably touching at least one of them right now. These are the large molecules of everyday life, and we can make them cheaper and net negatively. So far, we've created the fastest photosynthetic organism ever. We've shown carbon capture at a rate of a quarter ton a month, and found the enzyme sequence needed to turn that into jet fuel. We're Team of Columbia students. I was a science research fellow and named scholar. I published four first author bio papers and proceedings. Connor, our CTO has placed third internationally in the world's largest robotics competition before becoming the youngest ever president of Columbia robotics and vinish, our COO has published ml geophysics research for both the US Navy and Columbia's. Earth is two orbit androgen, the carbon negative pole company. Thank you for your

S Speaker 617:43angstrom. Ai builds generative models that run molecular simulations as accurate as wet lab experiments. Our generative AI never hallucinates because we've constrained it to obeying the laws of physics. We're a team of two PhDs and two professors from the University of Cambridge in the UK, and we come from the world leading lab in probabilistic machine learning and physics simulation. We also have industry experience at Google research and at instudy, which was acquired by biont. We launched six weeks ago, and we already have $150,000 in revenue from our first pharma project, computerizing sellability experiments. But sellability is just the first experiment that we've computerized. We're moving to replace contract wet labs used in preclinical drug discovery with GPUs. This represents a $15 billion market opportunity. Thank you. Applause. Bill,

S Speaker 1521:13Our vision models are deployed 50 times faster because we train them with CAD this is only possible now because transformer models with synthetic data have just started to work, this removes the labor intensive step of data collection of real world images. We have a $7,000 pilot with a customer about to deploy our model to detect defects in car door handles. We're self driving car engineers. I ran the reliability team at Argo AI and my CTO staff, who graduated college at 18, led their remote guidance team later as founding hires at stack AV. We took them from zero vehicles to five autonomous trucks in five months. We are going after the $50 billion market of industrial machine vision, solving problems for plastics, castings and machining, manufacturing.

We had this idea when we were both 19, working at Apple, and we realized that our team burnt a ton of time connecting services. We saw that we could remove this and cut out the biggest time burn that we face there. So I officially dropped out of college and we left our Jobs at Apple to build freestyle. We have never lost a single customer since our beta before YC started. We are freestyle.

S Speaker 2125:07Hey everyone. I'm Robbie Lin, the CEO of Siebel AI. Siebel AI builds large language models for enterprises through data development, fine tuning and inference. We launched two months ago and already have two of the world's leading AI, R D companies paying to use our product. My team comes from Turing, rap McKinney and Bain at Turing, we built the LLM training business and products to support over one 20 million in revenue growth in six months for companies like OpenAI, Google and anthropic. At Turing, we learned that large non tech enterprises like PepsiCo, Bridgestone and Volvo, who we actually work with, don't have the data that they need to train the models to produce real value, which means they're not going to unlock the value of AI without a partner. We're targeting 2400 of the largest non software companies in the world, and that scale will charge them 5 million per year to use to build, continuously, fine tune and deploy their custom models. This is a $12 billion opportunity to ever tackle me. Thanks so much.

Every AI agent will need a way to access the web, and they'll use us. For example, one of our customers today uses us to search landing pages to find customer leads, replacing a consultancy that was costing 10s of 1000s of dollars. We launched just three weeks ago, and we already have six customers in production. Jack and I met as some of the first engineers at Crusoe cloud, where we worked with AI labs to build and deploy large language models. Before that, we studied engineering at Carnegie Mellon in Berkeley. We are salor. Thank you.

S Speaker 2032:00Hi, I'm Jesus, and we are building contigo, a USDC, smart neobank for Latinos in the US and Latin America. We launched our peer to peer on ramp 26 days ago, and we already have 500k in deposits and more than 50k in revenue contiguous solves the currency volatility and cross border problem with a USDC spending wallet and a Bitcoin saving account that is fully integrated with a decentralized peer to peer enrollment built on top of it, this only became reasonably possible from the technology perspective, thanks to the breakthroughs on NPC, non custodial wallet infrastructure, we have a clear $84 billion revenue opportunity in transaction fees. Previously, I built Venezuela's largest stable Coinbase micro lending app, and my co founder, Gino did the same in Colombia and Mexico. Our founding team is ex Venmo Rafi newbank, and voila, and we are already backed by top tier firms like disti, global good water capital, summer capital, and some awesome Boise angels. Contigo is going to lead Latin America's transition from inflationary fiat currencies into a stable currency. Come join us.

S Speaker 2834:43Hi. My name is Marcos, and I'm the CEO of Hongyan. Pomyin is an AI native code repository. We're building an alternative to GitHub. In addition to storing code, we store valuable metadata that improves AI code generation. My co founder Harris and I met at UC Berkeley. We studied electrical engineering and computer science while working as engineers at LinkedIn and Microsoft. We became increasingly frustrated by the outputs of AI coding tools. We realized that if only they had the right context, they would produce vastly better results. While the industry's focus is on idds, no one is realizing that the true value lies in the code repository, the source of truth for all processes around code, repositories must evolve to lead the AI led development era, and existing solutions like GitHub and GitLab will soon become obsolete, not to mention, historically, repositories, not IDEs, have proven to be a far More successful business model. There are 10 million developers paying for repositories. Today, we charge an average of $30 per user per month. This is a $3.6 billion market opportunity. We are premiere.

I'm a former McKinsey consultant, and I previously led international expansion at neobank with over a million customers. My co founder Hashim was previously a tech lead at Deliveroo And Kareem. Globally, over $350 billion a year is spent on compliance software and headcamp. Today, if a bank wants to onboard a business customer, an analyst still has to go through hours of manual workflows, including passing complex documents and completing online investigations. These sorts of manual workflows exist across the compliance function at Remo, we automate these nano workflows so compliance teams can get through 10 times the cases in the same amount of time. We launched four weeks ago, and we already have three customers, including the US community bank, and we've crossed $104,000 of AR. We are Remo. Thank you. On a Google
