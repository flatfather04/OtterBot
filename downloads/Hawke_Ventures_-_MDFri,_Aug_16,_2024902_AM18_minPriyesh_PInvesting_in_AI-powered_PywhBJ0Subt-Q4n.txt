S Speaker 27:54yeah. So those are just some examples of companies that we've looked at recently, that we've invested in recently, but yeah, I'm seeing more interesting companies, I'd say, in the E commerce enablement side of things, versus ad tech and martech. I feel like things are a little up in the air just with ad tech and martech right now. You know, in terms of just issues going on with like privacy and you know, Google was going to get rid of, like, cookies with and then they changed their tune. So, you know, and some may say it's a really good time to be investing in ad tech and martech, given some of these, some of the uncertainty going on, but we're trying to, we're trying to develop kind of a thesis around some of the things that are, that are going on in ad tech and martech right now, and haven't quite gotten there yet.

S Speaker 212:26Yeah, they've got some nice traction. I mean, they're growing relatively quickly, you know, I'd say, you know, pros and cons. I'd say some of the cons are, it's a long sales cycle right to get into these stores, I'd say on the flip side, once you're in these stores, it's pretty unlikely that they're going to actually get rid of you once you're there,

S Speaker 212:52Yeah, I can go back and check. I think it's, I
S Speaker 112:55mean, I'm just off the top of you. That's the key. I mean, for any of this, it's ROI, right? Right, which is, and then, can they really trace ROI to do this thing, right?

S Speaker 213:06Right? In my understanding is that they have been able to do that, and that people who are actually interacting with the, you know, with with the screens, are actually spending substantially more money than people who are not. So they've run these tests, and people seem to be pretty, pretty happy with that. It's been a while since I looked at the deck. I'll send it over to you, though.
