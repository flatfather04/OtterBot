S Speaker 10:00It, getting to know more about you, and obviously hyper aligning with your investment thesis more closely. So there's that aspect of it. And then also on the flip side is that we have this program called 100 founders program, which we scaled quite a bit. We're at 7400 applicants right now worldwide, all of which have been like, you know, all of which are cap currently and actively raising capital, and then on top of that, they all have some sort of rapport. They've raised money in the past, they've part of a successful venture, they've they're part of a community like YC, and what we do is that we actually give you exclusive access to this network of individuals in your deal flow. So as the hyper part version of 40 gets to know a little bit more about you and your investor thesis and closely aligned to it will also give you access to this specific pool, and as long as there's people within this arm that are welcome to basically that align with your investor thesis, we're going to drive and surface that deal flow right to your inbox. And that's pretty much the extent of the program. There are a few changes in your workflow, but before I get to that, do you have

any questions? Priyesh, not really. Hamza, that sounds awesome.
S Speaker 11:03Yes, perfect. So same thing, which is awesome. You'll still be doing your actionable items, accepting and rejecting introductions on WhatsApp, email. So nothing changed on that front. The only thing that's going to change is any feedback you want to give to boardy any change in your positioning, it'd be awesome if you could. It will not awesome. It's part of the program is we get you on Slack, and we do that everything over Slack. So terms of seeing, of saying, hey, this deal flow was amazing, I need more deal flow like that. I want less deal flow like this, everything we're going to push towards Slack. So that's the only difference between you and I joining this venture partner program together and before. And then that's pretty much it. Honestly. Other than that, you're still going to be actioning, accepting and rejecting. Feel like I said, via WhatsApp or via email, if you ever just want to change positioning, and any further feedback, negative or positive, everything will be hit up on Slack. That's pretty much it

S Speaker 11:57feedback, feedback, if you have any, if you have any founders or venture partner people that you want to refer to us. We're happy. That's also one thing. It's a complimentary service. People say, how can you give back? If you feel like you ever need to give back to board, you just refer any kind of venture partners or just say, hey, you know, it's good experience. Give it a try out. But the only other step that we have to do today right now is I just have to get the Slack channel set up for you. So I'm going to create an invite link. I just popped it in our chat right now. So this is going to trigger a Slack channel creation, which within our workspace. Once it's created, I'll be able to see it, and then on the flip side, I'll be able to go get an email to join that channel. So I'll stay with you as we get that done.

S Speaker 22:37So yes, I've just signed up checking my email. And I'm so while we do that, I've always been very curious over the fact that I understand venture business sort of works on the very notion of arbitrage, right? You There are founders that funds want to chase their funds. There are founders that Chase funds, and then there's definitely an arbitrage over there. The Top funds get the best deal flow, if, if Bori actually becomes the universal layer for all of these interactions, yeah, this, will essentially break, and I don't think the entire industry would let it break. So how do you, sort of, internally in your coding ensure that it does not do that?
So yes, I've just signed up checking my email.

S Speaker 13:30You say you're saying it will break the industry, right? Yeah, I you know what? I've been getting. To be honest. I'll be honest with you, dish, I mean, I'm glad you get that. I've been getting it, but also the stuff also does fly over my head. I know I honestly, I have really great trust in my team, but I can tell you about the feedback. So I talked to the bench partners that everyone has been saying the exact same thing. They're like, You guys are either gonna go break do you wanna? You guys are gonna go break this or bust. So it's either, if you're gonna pick one of them, they said, We don't know if, but it's funny, because people are excited to see us kind of break it. I don't know how we're going to break it, but, you know, we're, I know what you mean, like, and I think, I think the value and what we're doing is also building the communities and getting everybody on board at some capacity. And if you realize, like, I mean, I don't know how we can, I don't know if that's going to make us bulletproof. But, like, we have the venture arm program, and it's a pretty strong venture arm that we launched. Like, we didn't launch it yet. We announced it. We're doing $100 million venture arm, which maybe you know that we know it's our skills program. So I think that once we have the community backing, I think that'll be the hardest component for us to break. But I think that, like, I can't tell you how we're going to tell you that we can't, but I'm going to tell you that honestly, I have full, full confidence in our in our decision making team, to be honest. Like, I would follow these guys even, like, at our product team, even the engineers, like, for you guys in San Fran, like, I've never been to San Fran, right? But have a lot of friends who've worked there, like, work for Mixpanel, yeah, they tell me about the environment. I've been in the only the Toronto tech scene for a bit, but I'm sure this is a normal kind of atmosphere in San Fred, but like what I'm seeing here at Bori. I'll be honest with you, I've never seen it in any Toronto ecosystem, and I've been a part of everything, like 111 DMZ Tech Stars. I've seen every founders, too. I've seen every different, equal part of the ecosystem in Toronto. I've never seen it literally, quite here at 40. Obviously, we're just trying to get the right things right. But, yeah, you know, totally, totally, man question. I'm sorry, I maybe I'm still obviously new to the industry, but, but, I mean, I it, I've been getting a lot of validation from the from a lot of the Venture Partners, and they say the same thing. They're like, Yo, what you guys are doing, it's amazing. It's just like, I hope you get it right. But if you guys had it right, get it right. It's gonna be, it's gonna be a game changer.
You say you're saying it will break the industry, right? Yeah, I you know what? I've been getting. To be honest. I'll be honest with you, dish, I mean, I'm glad you get that.

S Speaker 16:16it's very okay. That's the email you got. You know what I'll do? I'll just manually invite you. It's perfect because I actually saw that you created a channel. That's the most important part. I should be able to have, like, you know what? Here, just stay on the line. Yeah. Let me see my medics. You did this. Okay, I got good for that. Let me see. Let me get you on boarded. I'll manually do it, as we have. You should be able, you should be able to do it. We recently changed some stuff on Slack. They used to have to get approved by admin, but I think I can do it immediately now, so let me see.

S Speaker 16:56Yeah, we've also been, I would say, honestly, we're actually been getting the most excitement from the CBCS, like corporate venture capital, like, that's like, the people who have been not just getting it, everyone's been getting it, but like, I would say, the most passionate people who dig and ask the most questions. But like every, like any big corporate venture arm that, like we've dealt with so far, like we did play on day, we did big one that's operating at SF or a Middle Eastern, one of the largest companies in the east, they they're They all asked me with our founder. They're like, connectivity with your founder? And I'm like, yeah, so we try and set them up and but I was good. Like, for me, it's still a learning experience. But like, I love it. It's exciting. Actually. It's like, I'm grateful to be a part of the team, obviously. But like, I had a pretty good offer when I before I joined here. And, yeah, like, it's funny my because I know one of the founding members. He's like, man, we're doing something great here.
