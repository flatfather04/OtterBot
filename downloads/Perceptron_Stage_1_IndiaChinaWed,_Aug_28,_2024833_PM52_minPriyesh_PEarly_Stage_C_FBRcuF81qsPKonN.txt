S Speaker 19:22if I mean I'm assuming both OpenAI or Lama or all the other foundational guys are also using this data from the internet, which is multimodal right now, of course, they have taken a different path to productization, and it's bloated, maybe the transformer architecture, blah, blah, all of that. But they do have that data right? The multimodal data exists. Is there some advantage that they can bring in is from the left field? Basically it's not, it's not. A main path, the GPT path, may not get them there, but if there is, there an alternate path they can take on the data.

S Speaker 116:48It's a still understanding of language and audio and speech together, right? And image and video so and plus, you are augmenting that with better understanding of the world, because YouTube still has lots of they said, YouTube is like everybody is scraping YouTube. YouTube still has lots and lots of data. You need to be able to know what data on YouTube could discard versus what data on YouTube to use for your training model. So that's useful for them.

S Speaker 117:32So, so these guys, we, I mean this guy, Armin, he's the main, he's the CEO, and even though CTO is Akshat, Armen is actually the main guy behind the research. So Akshat also actually some of my good friends and CO colleagues, ex colleagues at Qualcomm are at meta fair, so some of the researchers from our side are at fair. So I actually called a bunch of them, and the feedback on both of them is very positive. Akshat actually ended up was working directly with one of my friends, so got good feedback, really good feedback on both of them from meta. This guy, Armin is also, I think he can attract talent and everything like the day he posted on Twitter that time to build or something, just one liner or something. So they get, like 1000s of people say, I think he can, which is key in this case, we have to be able to attract talent. And this guy is Luke. Is Luke is, like, a very well known guy across AI he's like, one of the, you know, one of the key people within the AI industry that people look up to. So he's an advisor. But he's these advisors are good for attracting talent, but so far, I mean, and then they're looking to hire five more people to build this team up to seven, which should get them to the first gen models, much more, they said.

S Speaker 127:15we so look lots of risk. Why best now? Why not wait? The problem is, as we know, even like, like this, cartesia is building, you go to their website, they're building edge models, Edge SSM models. But even then, I don't have a shot at getting allocation, and their valuation is going to run up. It's the next round is already going to be at a pick in dollars.

S Speaker 127:45every one of these companies, they run up in valuations really, really fast. So the question for us is, you know, either we just sit out these foundation model companies, or if we want to make a bet, then we with the ideally the time is at seed to get them.
