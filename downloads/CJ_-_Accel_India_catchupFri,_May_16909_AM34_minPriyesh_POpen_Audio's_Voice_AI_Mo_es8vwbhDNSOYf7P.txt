S Speaker 10:00Is just so visible that customers are more than happy to adopt and not think too much, and then I'm more than happy to pay for it, because the revenue accretion is significantly more than what the company would charge for the calls. So I mean, those kind of bets, I've seen a few, but again, challenge ends up being, I mean, is this the company you want to bet on? Usually, in these categories, there are three or four pairs of momentum. Defensibility is a little questionable, so that's been the barrier. But, yeah, curious to hear what teams you've been spending time on, or anything that you've seen in voice that has been of interest. Yeah,

S Speaker 20:36I asked that question because there's, there's this one company I was very excited about. We were very close to writing a term sheet in them, but apparently Qualcomm's compliance did not allow us to write a term sheet there. So it's a voice AI, company called the lab, is called Open audio, and the voice AI, it's a text to speech model that's called Fish audio. So so very new in the space, I would say. They launched their models early in January, and they they've been doing very good in terms of traction. So last four months, closer to 5 million in AR. The focus there is that they want to make the models very controllable and instructable. So most of the models right now, across 11 labs and all the other platforms, you'll see there are only few levels. Like you can adjust the pitch, you can adjust the tone, you can adjust the speed, and you can then give it a give it few defined personas, like speak in an excited tone, speak in XYZ, things like that. These guys make it very instructable, as in you, you create a dialog, and every word you can in bracket say, Make this excited. Make this in a scary tool. Make this something like that, and it generates very high quality audio from that. And the model that they use, typically, man, like of all the companies that you mentioned in your post, sesame is the only one which is using a dual transformer architecture. Everyone else, I would say, Cartesian, has a state space model. Other players have some form of proprietary RNN, CNN model. But these guys are very similar to Sesame in that fashion, they use a transformer model, so they give a lot of additional context to the model. Model understands how a specific words needs to be said given the entire context of the conversation, trying to add a lot of emotion and things exactly the paradigm that sesame is trying to work on. And then down the line, they also plan to expand into AI companions, which is what did not work for Qualcomm, because that's like risky area. It could be. It could get into not safe for work areas as well. So compliance wise, we could not get an approval for that. But pretty smart founder, young guys post their undergrad from University of Maryland or revenue scale. So the voice part they have built now they're working on long term memory, adding more contextualization, creating a LLM plus ASR hybrid, so that latency gets very small. Because for most of these models, you generate some LM tokens, then you send those tokens to a TTS model, and then generate out of audio, out of it. So there is it. It adds to the latency. They're trying to create a hybrid between that so that beach latency, where a part gets reduced, so then they'll be able to come to car t shirt. Level of latency is what these guys promise. Interesting company, MATLAB, if you, if you are interested in speaking to them, happy to thank you.

S Speaker 26:05yeah, I agree, man, fuzzy battle to fight. I think I agree on that even our thesis internally was the same key, very similar to how the video AI model, video AI market is going voice AI in terms of quality, latency, cost, maybe not, but not sure about cost, I would say. But why is in terms of quality and latency, every every model would converge, and hence, like I got a great about them, because they are building a companion app. They plan to have a comp, and they they plan to go vertical from here and own the own the application layer as well. So unka planet that their companion app would be an AI companion which would be available across different platforms. So it's not an app based, chatbot based interface. It's something that you can integrate across your iMessages, WhatsApp, web research, Chrome extension, so it goes everywhere. It's very similar to and the founder is very it's early to bet on them from an institutional point of view, but the founder is very excited from building an AI companion perspective, like he wants to bring. He's taking inspiration from real world relationships, and he's bringing a two way feed, so it wouldn't be a chat bot wherein you are only sort of initiating a conversation every time the companion can talk to you. The companion has long term memory, so it understands everything you have spoken to it for from a long time, and now they are working on building agentic systems on top of it. So it's like Siri on steroids, in a sense, if you can think of that. So they're going that way, and that's why, like betting on a TTS model makes sense. Otherwise, I'll do leave with you that quality and those differentiations will fade away long term.

S Speaker 27:58roughly like they launched, they were at 400k in Jan, so 5 million in the last four months, actually, and most of it is on their text to speech model. A lot of prosumer use cases. Apparently, they have very strong open source flywheel. So their model was initially open source. They get a lot of traction from them, from their all organic in actually a lot of traction from Reddit and YouTube, but mostly prosumer. Yeah. So

S Speaker 18:29India, May, similar company, the one that I've seen that got traction maybe a year and a half two years ago, is this company called worth fair. They were also to the scene in the TTS space, used a lot by podcasters and content creators, and I think at their peak had scaled to very quickly. Yeah, I don't know what happened there after that. I think the challenge with this kind of company usually has been joined that has been extremely high. I think that was the case even in 11 laps, when 11 laps was at 100 million dollars here our skin? Yeah, I had friends who evaluated very closely. I think a US team also spent time.

S Speaker 29:11Yeah, these days are early, so I don't think like you can comment on that churn, but last 10 weeks, the monthly, monthly retention is around 75% so it's not bad, but just because they have, they've been around for four months. Of course, that doesn't give you a signal, but yeah, I agree with you on those numbers for sure.

S Speaker 29:37I have been actually working on physical AI Pro, ah, last few months spent time on that space. So broadly, looking at companies like physical intelligence, skilled, which can be a foundation model layer for robotics to at a later stage in their golden era, but today, starting with computer vision or multimodal, more multimodal applications, and then down the line a robotics foundation model. So very on that front, doesn't look like it's very investable space. More specifically for Qualcomm ventures, because Bucha capital, there's still a lot of technology risk to be taken, which is not something that we would like to do. But at the same time, looking at the tooling layer there, what? What's the DevOps layer for physical AI, there's interesting space called Earth models, which, which I'm seeing pop up very more recently. So, how do you create, create a foundation model for Earth inference, and you train it on Earth observation data, you train it on weather data. And can you make insults out of it, like energy production, food yield, climate risk, disaster management, insurance, things like that. So that's a space I'm looking at, and then looking at some technologies which could solve the data scarcity for physical AI, because that's the biggest broker today. So broadly working on that. That thesis, in a sense, spoken to about 15 odd companies in that area. There are a few interesting prospects that I want to track,

So, how do you create, create a foundation model for Earth inference, and you train it on Earth observation data, you train it on weather data. And can you make insults out of it, like energy production, food yield, climate risk, disaster management, insurance, things like that. So that's a space I'm looking at, and then looking at some technologies which could solve the data scarcity for physical AI, because that's the biggest broker today. So broadly working on that. That thesis, in a sense, spoken to about 15 odd companies in that area. There are a few interesting prospects that I want to track,
11:19but, I'll see whether you've spoken to

S Speaker 211:23Jayesh. At Yeah, Jayesh is actually a good friend, like I met him last year. Salurian. Salurian is a company I plan to track like we did not do the last round because it was early, and seems like he did change his go to market as well. But yeah, do you know Jayesh? Yes, of
Jayesh. At Yeah, Jayesh is actually a good friend, like I met him last year. Salurian. Salurian is a company I plan to track like we did not do the last round because it was early, and seems like he did change his go to market as well. But yeah, do you know Jayesh? Yes, of

S Speaker 111:41course. I've spoken to him. I think he was raising five at 50, and this is right after his spicy, yeah, after he came out of IC, yeah, of course. I think did his undergrad in India and went to Stanford for his PhD. Was doing this as was Microsoft. And I think the GTM that he had in mind back then, at least, was maybe hedge funds and solar farm owners would find a lot of value in this at time to value ideally for the kind of pitch that he has, which is that, Hey, I am building the most accurate weather prediction model in the world. Can be fairly short. I mean, if a hedge fund can back test predictions over the last six months and see that this model is accurate more often than not and more often than what they're already using, I think the incremental money they would have to pay to have another vendor provide that solution to them versus the value that they would be extract, they will be able to extract out of it. I think that math is just, just makes a lot of ROI sense, yeah, their perspective, from the buyer's perspective. So if you get it right, it could fly. Was something that made it exciting,
course. I've spoken to him. I think he was raising five at 50, and this is right after his spicy, yeah, after he came out of IC, yeah, of course.

S Speaker 212:58yeah, yeah. I agree. I agree. And I wasn't very familiar about the energy trade market back then, like I come from the background, but more from renewable energy, for some matter. So I spoke to a few hedge funds, and turns out they they employ a lot of different models, and at the end, it's, it's an arbitrage market. So if all the hedge funds have it then basically does not give any any alpha to any one of them. So most of them use some of these models, but then build on top of it, and then use their proprietary derived data sets or their proprietary derived insights to finally make trading decisions. So kind of felt that it might not be that one solution that will power a lot of hedge funds, and it that way. So I was speaking to Jayesh, like a month back again, just sort of catching up because of this thesis. And he mentioned he shifted his GTM from powering hedge funds to now powering utilities. And it's at least in us, it's much bigger use case for utilities to plan how their energy acceleration would happen, and how do they plan long term for it. So he actually got into some total energies accelerator that that allowed him access to a lot of utilities. And he's scaling that we know. I'm

S Speaker 217:36What do you think this one company that I am in touch with Flux? Ai, yes, I met them earlier last year. That time they were raising a very small round, so we didn't have a very long conversation. I think they were raising a two and a half 3 million round. So it was for us, but it's an interesting space. I haven't personally look at this space. But one of our partners, Varsha, she has spent time in this space. And in fact, Fidra was one company we were considering investment in, I would say, June last year, sometime. Then they then they closed around, but we didn't take a bet. But seems like an interesting company. I was supposed to follow up with them sometime later this year.

S Speaker 222:58months. Yeah, I thematic wise, again, we vertical. Ai, I would say, we have been more opportunistic. So every now and then we did take a look very strongly on a lot of video. Ai models, particularly with Qualcomm, is getting into cloud. Ai chips as well. And we see maybe strategically, can partner with some of them, because they required a lot of AI workloads. So we may have some angle there. So looked at a lot of companies in that space Moon Valley, very well known in that space Moon Valley, Luma and runway are all three that we evaluated did not take up it because the valuation, we don't feel that valuation could be justified. And still, technology risk is still there, but that's a space. But personally, I'm taking a look at more thematically, at horizontal AI building platforms, so the through AI of the world and chain and a lot of upcoming New Age companies, computer use and browser use both most excited about computer use, I would say, again, feels like we have an angle there. So taking a look at that those spaces have a few companies that I'm talking to. Most of them still don't have a product which works 100% and the scale isn't there yet, but I don't have a thesis today on how I feel this market would evolve. I don't know if there would be a need of horizontal AI building agents for long term. We didn't make an investment in one tooling company in the horizontal AI building space. It's called Poki AI.

We are very clear on how the horizontal space would evolve down the line. What Poki is building someone either anthropic or open AI might build themselves. MCP is a step that way, but it's not 100% there, but, but it's not something that we very strongly feel that wouldn't get commoditized as well. But, yeah, planning, yeah, go ahead.

S Speaker 125:26Sure. No, I think Poki looked like a very solid research team, at least on paper. And I think someone in our US team has spoken, but I was cutest to chat, just to see and hear what the tool is looks like today. In fact, I'm actually, one of the things that I plan on doing is whatever tool that is easy to access without being an enterprise, I want to claim it, yeah, to actually get a feel for it and see if it truly works or not. Because a lot of things look great in demos, but break in production, even with the simplest of edge cases.

S Speaker 225:59No, totally, totally, man, that's, that's and that gives you the best sense of how a user would use it, at least if it is, if it solves some part of your own workflow. So I try to do that as well. Been, been using this company called taskate Quite a lot, and I feel I've spent some time on it, and it's growing on me. So that might be an interesting one that I will I've connected to the founders, so maybe they aren't raising right now, but maybe I'll follow them for some time. We made an investment in a company called context. It's context, dot, IMC, it's more in AI, native productivity, skew it so it's your Microsoft Office, all on AI. They're doing a lot of feature testing right now, but they haven't rolled out a general availability right now, but it would be a good company when it comes out. And I am just Googling them to see what
No, totally, totally, man, that's, that's and that gives you the best sense of how a user would use it, at least if it is, if it solves some part of your own workflow. So I try to do that as well. Been, been using this company called taskate Quite a lot, and I feel I've spent some time on it, and it's growing on me. So that might be an interesting one that I will I've connected to the founders, so maybe they aren't raising right now, but maybe I'll follow them for some time. We made an investment in a company called context. It's context, dot, IMC, it's more in AI, native productivity, skew it so it's your Microsoft Office, all on AI. They're doing a lot of feature testing right now, but they haven't rolled out a general availability right now, but it would be a good company when it comes out.

S Speaker 127:18I think I just came across fixer today, actually a few days ago, and fixer, I think, has changed to north of 5 million Arr, in less than eight months, or something touching 10 soon, is what I hear. And fixer is a very simple product. If you haven't heard of them, what they do is they're like on any other note taking app. Just that, I think that they've gotten the integration very seamless. Then you can start using it. As soon as you go to their website, it connects. Just works with your Gmail, and what it does is it will come up with a first draft response to all your emails, and it will ensure that notes from your emails, from your meetings, flow into your emails as action items, etc, and just email and calendar working very well in sync, is what they've cracked. And that in itself, is like, yeah. So I think, more than anything else, what I'm excited about is maybe building something of this sort, and not as a PC backable business, but as a lifestyle business making good money.

S Speaker 228:27It's it's such an interesting thought, because I've been marinating on this for the last few weeks. I have a friend at Sequoia, India. He left his job and completely on this specific thesis. He's like, I don't want to build a generational business. I want to build something which is a simple workflow, quick time to value lot of use cases immediately, and scale it to some few million dollar errors, and maybe down the line you get commoditized, maybe some some player which has a bigger distribution on the same workflow takes it over, and then that's fine, but you can make quick money here. It's easy to scale. I plan to, like, spend some time on it. I'm really, really, sort of very excited about this thought, spending time on seeing if there is a playbook in terms of scaling some of these solutions, because it's easy to build. It's just putting together a few APIs and having a good UI on top of it, and figuring out which workflows you want to solve. But then there is a playbook on scaling some of these very quickly. I want to figure that out. So if down the line you have some notes on it, would love to chat.

And what's the over? I mean, what's the thesis? So

And what's the over? I mean, what's the thesis? So
S Speaker 230:27the thesis is, it's a backwards compatible Microsoft AI suite, so compatible with Google, Google's doc suite and Microsoft Office Suite. But everything is on on web, and it's aI native. So your workflows, typically, you will see these verticals have a lot of players, very vertical wise. So for presentation, you have gamma, which is doing great in revenue napkin, for creating infographics and things like that. For spreadsheet analysis, you have Julius and tons of other different applications, but all of these workflows, typically for someone like you, someone like in management consulting strategy job, they their workflow starts from web research to putting together some numbers on Excel to taking some of those and creating charts and then putting it in A PPD or creating a doc. So all of these office suite are connected. Do all of that internally on the platform itself, and they've done some good work on long context understanding. So you put in a lot of your own documents in there. It does well web research. It would probably today in the beta version that I use, they have the best PPD generation tech there. So the value, I would say, Good company moves very fast. The founder is very smart. They've cracked long context understanding. They're working on memory, and they build and ship very fast. So will be a land grab situation. Will be something when they launch, they will try to make a big viral push out of it. And if they have something, it might grow fast,

S Speaker 232:26what's the it will be? It will be a prosumer motion, very similar to cursor. I think a lot of these companies are just going behind the cursor while emotion. So it will be similar to that. But they also have an enterprise offering talking to some of MBBS to see if they can be. Some of them are their design partners, so maybe they will scale that way as well.

So that's that's also a persona, one that I'm seeing quite often, and it is pattern matching in a sense, but I have this one pager kind of thing where I'm just sort of seeing what patterns I see. And this is a founder persona that I'm very excited about. Young founders, probably out of undergrad, and they build and ship very fast, because, AI may you don't see a mode today, but product velocity really, really does define product velocity, and tapping onto the consumer or prosumer and working on a good UX, and then probably launching something viral to start with these. These are some, some indicators that I am looking for. At least the tool looks very
