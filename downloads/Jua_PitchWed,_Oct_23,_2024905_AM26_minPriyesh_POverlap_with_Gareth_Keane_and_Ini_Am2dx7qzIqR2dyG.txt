S Speaker 10:00Check size is anywhere from two to ten million the sweet spot of check size is five to seven initial check size. That's a 10,000 foot. We can lead. We can follow. I would say we lead about 20% of the time, and 80% of the times we participate with others. But it's flexible.

S Speaker 10:29for a very brief moment? Okay? Did you so Gareth? I mean, I still run into Gareth event. I remember, I think he recently switched from promise to somewhere else. Thank you. Thank you. Tell you, or did you tell yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. He joined in Q tel, did you know? How do you Hi,

S Speaker 22:04maybe Benny, you want to say two words about yourself, and I can talk about the company. Please to meet both of you, Benjamin, staff that you are supporting and versus fundraising and business development. Great, yeah, then my background is serial entrepreneur. So I come, I ran the family business selling biomass to large energy companies. Sold that in 2014 about two times what the banker said we could sell it for. And then we and then we went to, or I went to start my first tech company, fleet management software grew back to about 10 million AR and 1000 BTB customers, and then partnered with battery ventures for a buy and build strategy. But at the same time, decided that making cars 10% cheaper wasn't going to be the mission of my life. Instead, I partnered with Marvin, the technical co founder of juar, and he comes from a weather system machine learning engineer. Comes from a weather background. His father started one of the first weather forecasting businesses in Germany. Marvin was the head of R D in the family business, and essentially found himself exposed to customers that wanted, you know, faster, more more precise, and so on and and was relatively quickly frustrated with explaining to people all the reasons why they couldn't get what they wanted, and instead started building something better back in 2017 Yeah. Fast forward to today at dua, what we want to do is basically make humanity climate sentient. What we mean by this is we feel that we currently don't really understand how we as humanity interact with the planet and how it interact the planet interacts with us in the built environment and so on. Why? Because the models that we have are very course, not, not many effects are taken into account. And so we feel, as a result of that, we're not really in control of our destiny as as humanity. So we very much believe in, you know, what? What we want to manage. We must first measure. And so basically, by building a model of the real world, by building a model of the real world, we feel like we can put humanity back in control of its destiny on this planet. And so the way, the way we take this to market is in the is in the energy sector. What we're building is two components, and it will be three soon. Two components are a real world models, or foundational model of the real world that we currently use to predict weather, but there can be used for predicting many other things, and then an agentic system, which is essentially meant to automate the work that analysts are currently doing within energy training organizations. So we're focused on 540 of the largest power and energy trading firms in the world. There are currently 10,000 energy traders working there that are responsible for essentially selling and selling the power and balancing the power grid and

S Speaker 17:39power and energy, essentially, yes, okay, which is and so Andres, a few questions, you know? So as we started looking in the space, we actually said, okay, you know, what should we call? Some traders. We tried to figure out who to call, and then we called a few traders. We could figure out connections with one, I mean, and our learnings from some of those calls was one, most of the large traders, they seem to have large teams of weather prediction and people were doing better predictions, data scientists within their own groups, as they source data from all these different sources and then and their key, their own key differentiation. Same solution to everybody, then their concern is that, okay? So then my model, everybody's using the same model. So for most traders, my question to you is, the traders that you work with, do they use the data or the signals from Jua as one of the inputs, or they trade on that signal, like, literally, that's the signal. And if that's then they don't have an arbitrage. Everybody's trading on the same signal, all of your customers, right? Yeah,
power and energy, essentially, yes, okay, which is and so Andres, a few questions, you know? So as we started looking in the space, we actually said, okay, you know, what should we call? Some traders. We tried to figure out who to call, and then we called a few traders.

S Speaker 29:15yeah, yeah. So, so I think there was a like, I mean, that's a big question to unpack, because it's basically, I guess, the question about, How do you build a big business in this sector? But the way that we think about this midterm is to become table stakes technology, so to focus more on the automation, rather than the edge, whilst also having a strategy to obviously monetize the edges, you know, for now and as long as we can. So specifically, how we do this, running different versions of the model, one that is clearly, you know, meant to be distributed as far as wide as we can, and then we just run another one earlier. You know that we that we provide only to a small number of very large organizations that that you know that can pay for that edge. Because, in reality, you know, people, like everybody, will tell you they want edge, but then how much are they really paying into? How much canal does it translate, and how much are they willing to pay for it is a separate question, right? If I can buy a data set for 10k and get massive edge, I'll also want it, but, but, yeah, so, so I think, I think the long term strategy is to really be a table stakes technology and not a provider of alpha, I think, or of edge. Because I think those have to try to be at least in weather. Those have tried to provide edge have generally stayed very small for good reason. And then I would also say that
yeah, yeah. So, so I think there was a like, I mean, that's a big question to unpack, because it's basically, I guess, the question about, How do you build a big business in this sector?

S Speaker 110:53so essentially, you want to provide as much automate, and by automation
so essentially, you want to provide as much automate, and by automation
so essentially, you want to provide as much automate, and by automation
so essentially, you want to provide as much automate, and by automation
11:00like, what's the output
like, what's the output
like, what's the output
like, what's the output
S Speaker 211:01we we we like right now, right here and now today. Just to be clear and avoid any misunderstanding, we provide a weather model and API to a weather model, and we sell on accuracy and speed. That's what, what we're what we're telling customers today, now, where we're going, in terms of the product is, is automating the work of those large teams that you're that you were referring to, that every large you know organization has, because we think that's where the real the real opportunity in this market is, is to build this end to end, the end to end, like technology stack that they can use to do a lot of things, like automatically, that that they had to do with their own their own spreadsheets
we we we like right now, right here and now today. Just to be clear and avoid any misunderstanding, we provide a weather model and API to a weather model, and we sell on accuracy and speed.

S Speaker 112:00and Okay, and so the and so, so right now, when you said, you said accuracy and speed is what you're selling today. And then by speed you mean this is being able to do predictions for the next hour, for the next minute, and then what? What do they get today? Like, no, no,
and Okay, and so the and so, so right now, when you said, you said accuracy and speed is what you're selling today. And then by speed you mean this is being able to do predictions for the next hour, for the next minute, and then what? What do they get today? Like, no, no,
and Okay, and so the and so, so right now, when you said, you said accuracy and speed is what you're selling today. And then by speed you mean this is being able to do predictions for the next hour, for the next minute, and then what? What do they get today? Like, no, no,
and Okay, and so the and so, so right now, when you said, you said accuracy and speed is what you're selling today. And then by speed you mean this is being able to do predictions for the next hour, for the next minute, and then what? What do they get today? Like, no, no,
S Speaker 212:27no. I mean, we do all that, right? We do prediction for the next hour and so on, but running the model at a specific time. But I works well from from a trading window perspective, so that you get the data exactly at the time that you need it to be able to so you're ahead of the market in terms of getting new insights, but still are still closed. So so you want to be ahead, but yours won't be close enough so they close to the trading window. And then you can, you can run, run trades on the on the inside. So when I said speed, I mean, in other words, how much faster you get insights than you would with one of the legacy models,
no. I mean, we do all that, right? We do prediction for the next hour and so on, but running the model at a specific time. But I works well from from a trading window perspective, so that you get the data exactly at the time that you need it to be able to so you're ahead of the market in terms of getting new insights, but still are still closed.

So what we what we charge, was just which, which parameter Do you want access to, how much geographic coverage Do you want. And then, like I said before, so if you, if you're taking the one that's running at the same time as the market, that's vastly cheaper, if you take the early one that's going to be, you know, at least 10 times as expensive as the as the one that's running at the same time as at the market.

In particular, inference, of course, is a lot cheaper because you're running inference once store the data services through API.

S Speaker 220:10Yeah, sure, so. I think we like throughout the next year, we want to raise total of 60 million US in which 60, 60% for compute, 20% to start building satellite constellation, and 20% for for more, more of the same of what we already do Today, so marketing, sales and building up the generic team.

People, and why launch your own satellites when you can use data from other people that are launching weather satellites?
People, and why launch your own satellites when you can use data from other people that are launching weather satellites?
S Speaker 220:52Because the data we want is not there. And I think like one of the reasons we took promos on board was because we, quite like, basically, from day one, understood we're going to build satellites and, okay, so this, again, is pretty nuanced, of course, the question for that, but high, high level, high level answer for now, we don't we don't see anyone currently building. We see people plugging holes in the value chain of atmospheric and like real world data. We don't see anybody really rethinking the whole value chain from scratch or the data, data set from scratch, and that's what we're doing. And so yeah, and I think just most of the constellations tend to get diluted by way of government contracts, which then drag you in the direction that is not optimal from from a product perspective, and and so on. So we really, believe in this building up the business and then truly building a satellite constellation only and exclusively for ourselves, so that we can really tailor it to the needs of the market, rather than having to tailor it to some government overhead. We may sell data to others as well, but we don't want to dilute our missions in the way that I think many people have, because they, you know, they couldn't make the money that they wanted from just selling data. That makes

S Speaker 223:23And they're, I mean, they're the perfect example of what they were saying before, right, where you kind of have an idea of what you start the satellite first, instead of product first, and then you just end up diluting yourself along along the way,

S Speaker 124:37So what we are trying to do so is build some smartness. And I know you're raising 60 million largest series A which means that you will need to so for this round, this particular round, we will not be a lead. I mean, they really come in as a lead in, you know, where we have, like, a lot of knowledge and really strong conviction to come in. So, but over the next, I guess, are you beginning of the process? Or have you, do you already have a lead? Or where are
