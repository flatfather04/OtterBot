S Speaker 12:07So very generally, and that may also be a segue into the funds focus, but particularly looking at a few horizontal AI agent building platforms. And in that aspect, the way I see it is, there's a spectrum of approaches. There is the Lang base, Lang chain of the worlds, which is framework first. And on the entire other spectrum, you have off the shelf, completely off the show, general purpose agents like Manus. So we have spoken to a lot of these players.

2:37Manus, yeah. Oh, wow. So
Manus, yeah. Oh, wow. So
Manus, yeah. Oh, wow. So
Manus, yeah. Oh, wow. So
S Speaker 23:53Okay, yeah, I could present our pitch deck or and then as part of the page, I'll do a quick demo of the product and go into technicalities. Is that what you were expecting?

S Speaker 14:05Absolutely big if you can do that, I have sort of used the product myself, so I've been I've been running, playing around with it, so I have some sense, but happy to hear what you think, and particularly how you plan to be positioning it. What are your target markets. Who do you see as ICP, things like that? Yeah,

S Speaker 24:23exactly. So we're working on retriever AI, imagine it as cursor for browser productivity. So sort of revolutionized IDE. Started off as a, I think, a vs Studio extension, and then iterated into a full fledged product and with pricing tiers targeting both individual developers as well as going into enterprise like like users. So that's where we like I think that's a really good analogy for us. And so to me, Arjun, so and Babani, my teammate, you couldn't, unfortunately, make today's meeting. But yeah, I worked at Google for five years. Worked on pioneering vertical federated learning, so creating models across data silos, you want to train a user model train like a model on both ADS data and search data, but you can't combine that data. So how do you train a model in such a way using technologies like differential privacy, private set intersection, homomorphic encryption, so creating on top of encrypted data and yeah, before that, I have two masters in MS, publishing engineering. My co founder, Pavani, she worked at Google as well, pioneering AI solutions for publishers as well as she has a MBA as well. So the product, the problem right is right now most people's professionals workflows is heavily tied to the browser and but it has become more that they're typing, copying, pasting, like repetitive clicks and typing, and they're hiring offshore contractors to, like, compile data sets or, like, do these automations, or they're setting up a script that just breaks whenever, like, some selector changes, or like even sites like LinkedIn, they dynamically generate their HTML. So like, you can't even write a script for LinkedIn, and then you have the problem of data wall behind the website and data behind the API, which we aim to solve with our AI web agent that can unify both in between agentic interface.

6:22So the the extension
S Speaker 26:25itself is, it's a quick extension for now, for various reasons we'll get into it has these to do, like you can record so you can demonstrate an action, and it will 100% repeat that action, and we have tools like you can connect to MCP server. We can generate tools on the fly. So for example, I had this HubSpot tool that I had generated just being on hubspot.com going to my developer account and being like, create a tool using this API key, okay, my authentication is expected,
itself is, it's a quick extension for now, for various reasons we'll get into it has these to do, like you can record so you can demonstrate an action, and it will 100% repeat that action, and we have tools like you can connect to MCP server.

S Speaker 27:10Yeah, so we have like, instead of like MCP, we think like a another amazing feature is on the fly tool generation, right? You don't need to even think about MCP server or like having, like, predefined set of tool tools lists, you can just tell the AR agent, hey, create a tool to load HubSpot contacts using my developer password, trying to remember where

S Speaker 27:38here so the API key it's using, it's using this access token because the access token is on the web page itself, right? So it can generate the code to use this access token. And this thing never leaves the browser, so it's like, and it's executing, so it's generating code to execute on the fly inside a sandbox within the browser, so you're running LLM code on the fly just with prompting. And, yeah and yeah, other features, but so that's like a brief overview, quick demo of like, go find Priyesh Qualcomm ventures,
here so the API key it's using, it's using this access token because the access token is on the web page itself, right? So it can generate the code to use this access token.

S Speaker 28:22cinema, connection request. And the benefits of our approach is you can do your own thing, like, in the browser. This thing is working on in the background, and like, for so, like, you don't even need to worry about it. You can just hide the tab and, like, get about it. And it's like, monitored if you want. I can read the news. I can, like, and our unique approach is, we have, we have, like, a planning layer that it not logged into LinkedIn on this account, but, but it was able to find you on LinkedIn. Oh, I guess it logged in for me. Okay, so I just canceled it, but I guess I could rerun it. So I had logged out of LinkedIn on this account, so that's why I was like, oh, it's not gonna work out, but it will. This is my testing LinkedIn account, so you'll get a new connection request from it. But anyway, so our whole approach is we have, like, a planning layer, similar to Manus, right? Like we have a planning layer with a whole array of tools like, extract this page to a Google Sheet, create a Google Doc, create a Google slide, do actions on this tab, or crawl through pages. Like, say, you have, like, Amazon product listings. Like, we have a specific crawl functionality to crawl through all of them, open, like a nested, nested pages and, like, extract data from them. Or we even have sheets workflows where we you have, like, some x data on Google Sheet and you want to enrich it, right? And we'll open new tabs on the web, extract data and, like, write it back to the Google Sheet, just all in your own browser. So like, like, I don't know if you know Clay play the really hot data enrichment startup, and we can do the similar workflow, but at like, a fraction of the cost by using your own browser. And yes, I can just give an example of that. So I just had a YouTube video where I had done it.
cinema, connection request. And the benefits of our approach is you can do your own thing, like, in the browser. This thing is working on in the background, and like, for so, like, you don't even need to worry about it. You can just hide the tab and, like, get about it. And it's like, monitored if you want.

S Speaker 110:33And so your approach is not a visual language model based approach, right? You you're going on the HTML file.
And so your approach is not a visual language model based approach, right? You you're going on the HTML file.
And so your approach is not a visual language model based approach, right? You you're going on the HTML file.
And so your approach is not a visual language model based approach, right? You you're going on the HTML file.
S Speaker 210:41Yeah. So, yeah, that's it out of their approach. So, yeah. So that's the other benefit of our thing, is that we are a DOM only. We are only using the HTML. So we can operate on multiple tabs in the background, and we can, we don't need you to be active. You can do your own thing. I was had a video here. I was like, get an AI web agent to do your work. It was like, I don't know if you could see this really well. Had this list of people go find their LinkedIn. And so it opened all of these tabs in the background, and it I was like, Okay, I'm just gonna read some news while it's working. And so I was like, reading news, and I and reading news while it waited, and then it wrote all of that enriched data of these contacts from their LinkedIn profiles. And yeah, so that was a, one of the many benefits of our approach. And yeah, we can dive deeper into, like, our benchmark results so far. Sorry, I'm jumping around a lot,
Yeah. So, yeah, that's it out of their approach. So, yeah. So that's the other benefit of our thing, is that we are a DOM only. We are only using the HTML. So we can operate on multiple tabs in the background, and we can, we don't need you to be active. You can do your own thing. I was had a video here. I was like, get an AI web agent to do your work.

And yeah, so that was a, one of the many benefits of our approach. And yeah, we can dive deeper into, like, our benchmark results so far. Sorry, I'm jumping around a lot,
11:41but no, absolutely, that's, that's, that's fine.
but no, absolutely, that's, that's, that's fine.
but no, absolutely, that's, that's, that's fine.
but no, absolutely, that's, that's, that's fine.
S Speaker 111:46Just, just a question. Do you think the HTML based approach, does that hamper the accuracy somehow? Oh,
Just, just a question. Do you think the HTML based approach, does that hamper the accuracy somehow? Oh,
Just, just a question. Do you think the HTML based approach, does that hamper the accuracy somehow? Oh,
Just, just a question. Do you think the HTML based approach, does that hamper the accuracy somehow? Oh,
S Speaker 211:56well, this is a perfect slide for that question, because we did, a benchmark of our performance compared to, like, even OpenAI operator, yeah. So as you can see, we are even being OpenAI operator, like, with a human assistant, right? Like, operator, I don't know if you've tried. You have to. It always keeps asking you back for feedback. Like, should I proceed? Like, should I go ahead? Or, like, it was very buggy, so we built on someone else's benchmark. Is the YC company illuminate, they benchmarked all of these agents, and we ran their benchmark with our agent. And yeah, the benchmark results are like, the we have the videos of the like, running the benchmark is like, 10 hours of YouTube videos, but yeah, so the so we were able to beat open AI operator, even with that human assistant, with our web agent. And one of the reasons is, like, a lot of websites have these. So operator is a vision based model. You submit a screenshot, it figures out a coordinate and be like, Okay, I'll click on this pixel coordinate. And a lot of these web pages, like, had overlays, had, like, pop ups, had all of these things that you have to, like, close out, right? And they just confuse it. They couldn't figure it out. Like, how to, like, close it out. If it messed up, closing it out. It was just stuck in loops, right? And we're seven times faster than like the so this is taking into account just successful tasks, right? Like the unsuccessful tasks, they go on for 30 minutes, but like, it's just a successful task. We're seven times faster than the next leading agent, and it's like, not even like, it's a different thing. So we average one minute per task for like browser, like someone an agent on browser based cloud, for example, was taking minutes, right? And that's 20 minutes you're hosting a cloud browser. You're paying for proxies. The costs just go through the roof with this cloud browser based approach, right? So that's one reason, like the wire DOM. So it's like even while I was monitoring the agent work, like there was overlay for me, and it was working underneath the overlay by triggering the guidelines. So it was not a problem for our agent at all, and it actually improved the performance. And the cost for us was like almost like 10 cents per task, which was like $40 to do this whole benchmark. And we know I talked to the person who ran benchmark for the other agents. He was like, just for browser based, just for hosting, it cost him over $3,000 to run it. And so that is the insane cost difference. And that is like a different order. It's just like the everyday use is not possible with this other approach, right? Like, for us, there are people that are running like, every day, like, constantly, like, like, they're just, like, addicted to it a little bit. And there that is not possible, yeah, but the cost paradigm of this, yeah.
well, this is a perfect slide for that question, because we did, a benchmark of our performance compared to, like, even OpenAI operator, yeah. So as you can see, we are even being OpenAI operator, like, with a human assistant, right? Like, operator, I don't know if you've tried. You have to. It always keeps asking you back for feedback.

S Speaker 114:56And how are you thinking about scalability? Urgent is, do you see any roadblocks to scaling it to 1000s of concurrent requests anyway? The latency and efficiency are amazing, but is it, is it also scalable in the same fashion?

S Speaker 119:12I mean, so super interesting approach. Totally understand the way you, you're approaching it and the benefit, but that also downstream, sort of positions you in a different way. Let me, let me break it down in so there could be use cases around data enrichment and in general, let's call it web scraping. And then there could be more be scope use cases around agent tech solutions. The first bucket, you would probably need more scale. The second bucket, you would probably be need more chain of thought, reasoning, more planning. Function cost, more tool cost, things like that. And then downstream you that sort of also dictates which market are you going from mid market, enterprise, prosumers, things like that. So how are you thinking about, sort of building capabilities in each of those two buckets, and then which are, which would be the users for you?

S Speaker 220:07Yes, I think you got the exact thing. We have a site for that. It's like our goal is 100x bet productivity. One side is workflow engine, like run automation tasks. Yeah, we have. Another side is like an enrichment platform, where we enrich like Google Sheets. And then on other side, is like a universal API hub, using our web agent to like, integrate with any tool. And in terms of, like the go to market, right, like we're aiming, like we're starting off with like targeting pro Zoomers, targeting like people who, like, want to tinker around, and we have like power users, we want to like support, like our Chrome extension as a MCP server, so that you can then connect books and like other cool features. So it's like, they can, it can be triggered by like, remote events, yeah, and even from your phone, you could just type a message and like trigger on your laptop. So for like, and that will be wild for them, but we are seeing a lot of usage for small and medium businesses. Like, really, like, there are people that come to us. They're like, Hey, I like, love, AI. It's been 100x productivity boost for other things. And this tool seems like it's going to even automate my web pass. Like, I have to, like, go fill out this form every day. I need to go, like, look at there's a lot of use cases for us. Of like, I need to go to the local command site, look for all the new cases, extract their plaintiff. Like, go through the PDFs and extract the plaintiffs and the court details, like, stuff like that. And our web agent, we can just put it on a schedule. It can interact with PDFs as well within the browser and extract this data. So it's automating these, like, high value tasks, right? And are similar to cursor, we want to from a bottoms up approach of, like, hey, getting, like, people to try around with it, and then they want to bring it to work with them, like, as an enterprise productivity tool. And so like, I'm an employee, I want to just like, get my work done by like, talking to this agent, and we can work through, like, setting up a silo deployment for them, doing custom pricing, of course, for the silo deployment. And we think, like a client side version, like a web agent, is much more useful than a if you are trying to access a Google doc on your browser, you won't have access to it like the web agent itself won't have access to it. The permissions match up. If you're doing it on the server side, right? Like a server side agent, you'll have to basically duplicate all the existing permissions and, like, constantly update them. Yeah, right. Like, hey, this person has access to this doc and these resources. And okay, I need to schedule an update every day to make sure they're in sync. So there's a lot of benefits with our clients. We think is valuable to enterprises for security reasons as well. So that's I hope that answered your question, and we could dive deeper into that
Yes, I think you got the exact thing. We have a site for that. It's like our goal is 100x bet productivity. One side is workflow engine, like run automation tasks. Yeah, we have.

I talked to one of these agentic browser people, like fellow AI. I was like, hey, like, how are you keeping up with the latest like Chromium security patches, like they push out daily.

And they're like, Hey, we think the people who are interested in agentic browsers, or agentic things are not as interested in security,
Yeah, so the idea is, like, why did we start with the browser? Like an extension first for browser you need, like, like a team of C Plus Plus engineers to just get in the latest chromium patches, like all the security updates Google pushes out, it's like, you would need all of these people to integrate the latest things.

S Speaker 224:33So, yeah, so, because you have to take these shortcuts, because of the it is so hard to build a browser for you need a huge investment, but we're open to it in the future, like, similar to how cursor did it, like, do one step at a time, build out the agentic capabilities, get a solid base, like, flesh out what this space is going to look like. But and in the future, what we think it's going to really change is that we can offer our users credits for opting into proxying requests, right? So turn our users into a pool that we can distribute, like a complex workflow, like on the public web, not on like, siloed sites like LinkedIn, but like, say, I need to go through, like, a million Amazon products. I can for the users that opt in to proxying, they'll get credits in return. We can distribute that workload on users and do it at like 100 the cost of these cloud browser alternatives, but that's a much more long term plan.

S Speaker 125:32Super interesting. Arjun, yeah, that makes a lot of sense. How has the traction been so far. I think most of the JTM approach so far has been just personal branding. In a sense, you haven't been running any marketing campaigns as such, or any outbound sales, SMB sales, kind of motion that you have triggered

S Speaker 225:56just starting this. Yeah, we haven't done any of that. We're just starting, like a launching YouTube video. This one just came out today. So we're launching the collaborators of like that have like he has 150k views. So he, coordinating with these collaborators, created product demo using our agent. And that has we have two so far that happened, and each of them got 1000s of users, and we have three that are supposed to come out this weekend in our main go to market, sales, sales motion. But we think that that's actually like we're bootstrapped right now. We are limited in the amount of marketing we can do, and that's what the fundraising will be going towards, leading towards more of that. But the user numbers, the site isn't updated yet, but it's we have over 6000 users. It's been growing like doubling every month, and we think with this particular weekend of all the collaborators, it should increase dramatically. Yeah. The ask is 3 million. Safe note that will go towards hiring engineer, going getting dedicated LLM inference and like, right now, we're on Gemini. We're on Google Cloud. We are Google Cloud for startup program, but we don't have, like, a quota for Gemini, so a lot of the requests are at best. So it's like, sometimes there's some latency, and we want to we are getting a ton of user data in terms of the trajectories of the successful web pages. We can fine tune our like, our gem, like, the model that we're using to be able to more, have even higher success rate. So that's one avenue we want to budget go towards as well as like more marketing to actually build out the user base.

S Speaker 127:46That's pretty interesting. Arjun, any thoughts on running some of your instruments on device? I would like to see if there is any Qualcomm partnerships as well that we can sort of initiate right away.

S Speaker 228:00We're completely On Gemini for now, Gemini flash, which is like Google's like, basically mid tier model. We're basically, we're so close that Gemini flash light is like almost there in terms of getting us there.

S Speaker 129:10totally, totally understand that. So, Arjun, this is pretty interesting. I would appreciate if you can send me the deck, any other reading materials that you would like me to go through that would be great as well. In terms of our around we we typically write series A checks. We have started doing seed as well. And check sizes are $2 so I think it would come on the smaller side of the round. And I would like to have a chat with the team MC, if we can go slightly lower as well, because then it would make sense for you to also sort of create a good construct of the round. But let me get back to you sometime next week with the next steps on our end. This sounds pretty interesting, certainly excited about the approach that you're creating, and maybe we'll also sort of follow up with a few async questions. If I have
