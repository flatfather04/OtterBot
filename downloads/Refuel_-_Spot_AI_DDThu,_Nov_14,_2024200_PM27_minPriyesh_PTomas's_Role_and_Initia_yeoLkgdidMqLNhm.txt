S Speaker 20:48But I didn't know that he last Friday when I met him, I didn't know that he had been trialing this. And we found out through Priyesh that toman is the one who's traveling, so it's a good thing. So we can be pretty blunt with Tomas

S Speaker 24:47I didn't know that you were also trying. We've been using them for a year or something. Oh, you've been using them for a year. Okay, okay, so thanks for doing this so much. So, you know, we started looking at this base of data curation recently, and then came across refuel, actually, Tanuj made the introduction to refuel and, and, but Tanuj didn't know that you were using it.

8:46interesting, okay,
S Speaker 28:51and you said you created an agent, and this agent is what? It's a dashboard. What is it? I can show you, but it's
and you said you created an agent, and this agent is what? It's a dashboard. What is it? I can show you, but it's

S Speaker 49:09I haven't looked in a while, but it was basically you create, let me log in here. We created five different agents, basically for Nix code and is adding the main LinkedIn page all of that. So basically that compiles different sources and then outputs the given think about an inbound flow, right? What happens when you use clear bit on all these other out of the box databases? Usually we saw like a 30% coverage. So it's pretty bad.

9:46Then feeling that other 70%
Then feeling that other 70%
Then feeling that other 70%
Then feeling that other 70%
S Speaker 49:49you want, that's where we basically added refill, and we took it to a pretty high coverage, I remember exactly, but about 90% coverage with all the refill. What enrichment
you want, that's where we basically added refill, and we took it to a pretty high coverage, I remember exactly, but about 90% coverage with all the refill. What enrichment

S Speaker 411:00Should basically you have different data sets that you can upload, then you have your tasks or your different applications. So it's really simple UI. Here we deploy this as a task or fashion agent, where you then prompt the agent, you can evaluate or train that agent. This is where you select which model you want, and then what are, what say, like input the different fields. And then here, what's the output you're looking for. So then in here, you can see all the different results, and then confirm or exclude and train the model in the UI, and then deploying the apps. This is, for example, the next good categorization building. This is really simple. You go to here, add a task, and then you basically here, you can deploy and have a browser URL, you can kind of play with it, and like a few clicks, you need a back end to deploy a whole agent, if that makes

12:37here, this is what we
here, this is what we
here, this is what we
here, this is what we
S Speaker 412:40had sent that. So the input here is only an account name and a domain, and then based on that, they go searching the website, they search Google, and they basically, they also basically get us context, the three digit names codes and the six digit experts, and then we don't have that, then they basically output two labels, the three digit the next score and the six
had sent that.

S Speaker 213:14And you are using this as for lead gen?
And you are using this as for lead gen?
And you are using this as for lead gen?
And you are using this as for lead gen?
S Speaker 413:20Yes, I would say that we use this imagine as this
Yes, I would say that we use this imagine as this
Yes, I would say that we use this imagine as this
Yes, I would say that we use this imagine as this
S Speaker 413:27database categorization, cleaning, labeling. Yeah. So in order for me to do lead gen and type Gen, I need to keep that database enriched and refreshed over time and next. Code doesn't change too much, but there are others that we do, or whenever we ingest new data, we also want to, you know, keep that clean as we add it into Okay,
database categorization, cleaning, labeling. Yeah. So in order for me to do lead gen and type Gen, I need to keep that database enriched and refreshed over time and next.

S Speaker 213:56and on top of it, are you what is your agent? Agent is essentially something that is actually enriching your database, right? And that's in your Salesforce,
and on top of it, are you what is your agent? Agent is essentially something that is actually enriching your database, right? And that's in your Salesforce,

and on top of it, are you what is your agent? Agent is essentially something that is actually enriching your database, right? And that's in your Salesforce,
S Speaker 414:08yes. So the way, what I mean with agent, think about it as, will you create an API, just a name, called API, and then on different processes, HubSpot, Salesforce, Google Sheets, whatever you want. You then ping that API. They with input, domain, Salesforce, IP, whatever, and then that returns the next code. So I build that workflow HubSpot, really simple, that basically gets an account, sends the information, gets back the next code, and then that's
yes. So the way, what I mean with agent, think about it as, will you create an API, just a name, called API, and then on different processes, HubSpot, Salesforce, Google Sheets, whatever you want.

14:40the value of that record.
the value of that record.
the value of that record.
the value of that record.
S Speaker 214:43You are not applying any LLM on top of this, right? Like, right now this is primarily for you to get, have lead gen such that it can enrich your database with with all the stuff that you want, right?

S Speaker 414:59Yeah, you can build, like, other data transformations and what an agent? Suppose. The use cases are endless here. So for example, redoing your database and doing a lot of like, think about like, those manual, difficult tasks that usually end up with, like a human involved. You can then layer this pretty accurately. So the way, what I really like is how you can measure the efficiency of this, so simplifying a lot of that kind of more deeper data engineering required to a simple dashboard where you can abstract,

S Speaker 416:05hadn't done it, to be honest, we have access to different databases to lean forwards and have those but then

hadn't done it, to be honest, we have access to different databases to lean forwards and have those but then
16:14we we hadn't built
S Speaker 416:18the workflows we built with refill prior to them, because we also wanted to run on the more efficient, cheaper side of things. So obviously the easiest would be just, you know, connect your database to COVID, click enrich, excluding the coverage. It has feel right that be the easiest. But we expected to do that, especially when you have a 2 million database,

S Speaker 216:46got it and did you ever give like something else a shot like, Did you consider like snorkel has something called snorkel floor or something or

S Speaker 416:57No? Not really, not really we got introduced to rich, from Rich, I would say, in Gupta, a while back. I know they were. They went to Stafford to get a connection there. Yeah, they were, they there was a connection there. So we said, okay, let's give it a try, the trial. Then for for some time. And then we just said, you know, let's go. So really good experience with them, especially, I would say the team and support really good. They really were not eligible with llms. And then whenever we, like, they're always down. Whenever we have any problem for like, grabs, whatever setting up problem. They're always available for us. So we have a real experience. And the good part about like, once we spend, I would say, time, we invested time when you're building these models and fine tuning them and basically measuring the accuracy. But once it's working, then it flies. That I haven't logged in in, you know, months. It just like, on the on the background,
No? Not really, not really we got introduced to rich, from Rich, I would say, in Gupta, a while back. I know they were. They went to Stafford to get a connection there.

S Speaker 218:00working. That's pretty good. And so the background is working, and then essentially you're seeing your Salesforce pipeline fill up. That's pretty good, though. Maybe we should use it for like Priyesh filling up top of the funnel for sourcing start and
working. That's pretty good. And so the background is working, and then essentially you're seeing your Salesforce pipeline fill up. That's pretty good, though. Maybe we should use it for like Priyesh filling up top of the funnel for sourcing start and

S Speaker 218:39That's important, that's pretty good. That's actually interesting, very, very interesting. And then so you would like, you're not paying that that much, right? Like,

S Speaker 418:53yeah, we're not paying we were so we are paid, but we're paying a monthly fee. Remember, exactly how much was I wasted on most. And then basically the usage cost we negotiated early on as they were kind of figuring out how to sell this. We did a pretty good deal on currents of chatgpt, one of their models. So that way, basically has, yeah, it has really been pretty cheap. Okay, so I know, how is there, like, new, updated pricing structure, but we got a pretty good deal, and we haven't spent much

S Speaker 419:39Anything else, I would say the other upside there is, today, we're sure kind of paying the cost, but over time, we can replace that align with their model, and that's like 10 times cheaper. So it's really like, I would bet we're the smallest customers they have, because if you're able to imagine you have your bigger company manage way larger data sets then it really makes a

S Speaker 420:38I could double check. But for the most part, I would say the main the first set of agents we built was to enrich data. So that's where we used a lot of the external sources. You could also build use workflows for your own data. It depends on how you have your own data structure, but I would bet that it should work pretty good, meaning that it's a you're receiving, you can see load your first party data, and it should be on an output that have a pretty good output there. So, yeah, it should be doable.

S Speaker 421:35for you, right? The value for us that has having good data, structured data is huge. Especially, like, yeah, I gotta express how important is that, especially the industry, for example, they need to go to one because really that, then we create a, you know, a structured way of measuring that, so there's a lot of value for the business created by just having good data. And usually, like, probably, you know, talus didn't know about this, I guess, I bet, because these are more product marketing ops or Salesforce simulated problems that nobody wants to see but they want to use,

Anything else? Priyesh,
S Speaker 322:27not really. Tushar, just to us one, one point I'm curious about there are a few sales enrichment platforms. Let's say one company I've come across as Omni. They can do what the workflow that you're currently using refuel too, but they can add additional set of set of additional data enrichment, points, sales pipeline features, reach out, things like that. So do you see that replacing refuse use case? Or do you think this is separate of that? If

S Speaker 422:59I understand correctly, it's like clay could be another example, right? Because you would say you can also build right out of these different conditions, what ended up happening and what happens, or what is that happening for us? For example, initially we tried doing this enrichment workflow in state, and then we basically building retro. The reason we did that was, it's pretty hard to build a kind of stronger AI agent in clay. You'll have as much context, and it is accurate, I would say. So what that means is you probably rely only on chatgpt, which is a pretty broad model compared to with refill they they're developing also their internal models, and much be more specific for industry. So it's kind of a good balance between the depth you want to give it, the model, the kind of sophistication, or the narrow or the bias for it with a simple way of using it, compared to doing that in, you know, in clay. And so although you might connect different databases of stuff which is useful, the LLM and the actual core of it is pretty harder, will be less accurate, and then you don't have a way of measuring the accuracy of that model. So what happens is, you do that at scale, then you're not, you know, what's the error rate? You don't know. It's harder to measure and put that into production.

S Speaker 324:27Yeah, got it. And at spot, are you seeing any non technical teams using refuel, either creating workflows or using the agents that you've already created?

S Speaker 424:41And inside, I would say we, we haven't also made it as popular for other non technical but for a technical person, it's also pretty easy and reduces like what's entirely building yourself, and then there's a huge ramp up to build your agents and figure it out, and they put into production. Maintain that in production, figure out the back end and edit, yeah. So even for us, it's really easy, and then once you said it, we basically saved the first version. Optimize it.
