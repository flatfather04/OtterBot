1:27I focus on AI investments at Qualcomm ventures.
S Speaker 11:31And Qualcomm ventures this firm has been around for about 2040 years we invest we strategic venture rounds invest in areas that are strategically relevant for Qualcomm. So but we don't necessarily need to have a partnership. When we invest. It's more of a long term partnership. And so we work with a lot of our portfolios as they evolve. And so we deploy one $50 million every year.

S Speaker 42:31Yeah. Hi, Tim. Great to meet you. Thanks a lot for taking the time. My background again is also from engineering but more in biotechnology side. Post Graduation I've worked with a lot of early stage startups across different industries from FinTech, ad tech, social media, and work with a very early stage startup and clean tech grew it to the unicorn status moved to the US to pursue my MBA over the last two years I've been involved in venture world with funds across Menlo Ventures Morpheus and more recently joined the Qualcomm team. I think I've been here for about three months, and working here as a senior associate.

S Speaker 13:44So I've led our investments in weights and biases, hugging face and actually I name out a bunch of so we've done a lot of infrastructure investments. And then now we're trying to do more application investments as well.

S Speaker 34:06I see what I mean. So we're gonna do that. Let's see. Yeah, okay. Let's do background stuff. And we're, you know, you probably saw on her website, we're doing brag as a service. Yeah. I mean, that's so nice to talk to AI people are just like, okay, that's what it is. I mean, you understand. We can tell you why we're different and how we're different. Yeah.

S Speaker 26:35I can ask you. What do you mean when you say it doesn't work? Like what do you think it's

S Speaker 16:47was or we had a threshold the accuracy to be above 80%. And in most cases, the accuracy was anywhere from 17% to 60%. For the other solution. So this was this was not after this was after you have spent time with enough subject matter experts to get question answer pairs and generate synthetic question answer pairs and and go through the whole pre training post training workflow. And, and then deploy it in production with you know, like an hour lecture which which are thumbs up and thumbs down from a bunch of engineers. We have allocated 10 engineers towards this project. And eventually, you know, after a month of usage, we couldn't get to a high level of accuracy. And then a big challenge for us. I'll just tell you what, since we're talking about this a big challenge for us but we really one of the big challenges was was data ingestion, which is we had data in all sorts of formats. And data ingestion pipeline was one of the bottlenecks and then sort of the solution at work that actually they had worked really hard on data ingestion and supposedly that map I mean, it's working so it's getting deployed in production. So that means

S Speaker 18:44It was sophisticated. I knew it was sophisticated because everybody that we engaged with said, Oh, wow, this is very sophisticated.

S Speaker 38:53I'm impressed. Most of the folks we're working with like their test suite is like we just tried a few questions and like I didn't really like the answer. So we're doing pretty good.

S Speaker 19:15We train a lot of models ourselves. We try to deploy a lot of models ourselves with a lot of our customers as well. So so we know. It's a very deep tech oriented company. So it's like

S Speaker 19:49Yeah, at the end of the day, you know what I realized at the end of the day, that there's bias for most customers. And they typically mean you can try to educate, it'll take a long, long time to educate on how to build the right test suite. They will decide at the end of the day we'll decide on okay, you know what, I've got a new question of the day so does it work with that or does it not really doesn't work with this crap? Yeah, that I was saying, Okay, let me give it okay. You know what, this thing is going to keep improving. So let me keep at it for six months, and it'll be amazing.

S Speaker 310:36so you know, that's, that's our reflection as well. And it speaks to kind of the state of the industry, right, like we there's a bunch of believers here and they all kind of can see that this is gonna work at some point. There's early adopters that are willing to take a risk. And
so you know, that's, that's our reflection as well. And it speaks to kind of the state of the industry, right, like we there's a bunch of believers here and they all kind of can see that this is gonna work at some point. There's early adopters that are willing to take a risk. And

it kind of speaks a little bit how we've structured the
S Speaker 310:59you know, the burn and it's like, we're, we're, we're there's stuff we can do. And we're working on that. And then there's stuff that just needs to like the industry needs to kind of catch up and evolve and tooling and everything needs to be there. And, and so, we're taking it a little slow, in order to allow for that to happen to kind of like, be at the right time.

S Speaker 111:26Okay, and, and so I'm curious so like, as I look to your website, it's it's more orama search. Ask Rama and so, at a high level, it looks like you're focusing on Enterprise Search.
Okay, and, and so I'm curious so like, as I look to your website, it's it's more orama search. Ask Rama and so, at a high level, it looks like you're focusing on Enterprise Search.

S Speaker 311:51Yeah, so So yeah, sorry, sorry, websites a little like we have a new MC. Maybe we can pull it up actually. That's launching in like a week.
Yeah, so So yeah, sorry, sorry, websites a little like we have a new MC. Maybe we can pull it up actually. That's launching in like a week.
Yeah, so So yeah, sorry, sorry, websites a little like we have a new MC. Maybe we can pull it up actually. That's launching in like a week.
Yeah, so So yeah, sorry, sorry, websites a little like we have a new MC. Maybe we can pull it up actually. That's launching in like a week.
S Speaker 312:06we've evolved to the place that we are and, and where we came from, was search. And what's cool about that, so like I could tell you what makes Rama different. So one thing that makes the Rama different is its batteries included. So we're we're delivering like an entire rack stack. It's it's all in there. It's not like a framework and you decide which vector database and you decide which the which should now it's like, the only thing we let you pick as the LLM.

And even that we only let you pick the generative LLM.
S Speaker 312:46We do let you mess with the embeddings models and stuff like that. But it doesn't make that much difference. Like we've kind of refined our own version of like we have our own NLP we have our own NLP data chunker. We have our own embeddings models. We kind of just try to make it really easy. The second thing which flows from the first thing I really it's the first thing that flows from the second thing is that we're targeting the everyday full stack developer. So we're not targeting ml engineers that are Python experts and want to go into their own their hole they want to go to like build my own chain and do all this stuff. Like there's a lot of people that want to do that they want to build their resume. They want to play with all the tools they want to assemble their own PC and go install their own CPU and let's not ask we're like hey Biomek it's got everything in it. And the user experience is better because it's but it's limited. Like you can't customize every little thing. But it works. And what about
We do let you mess with the embeddings models and stuff like that. But it doesn't make that much difference.

Like we've kind of refined our own version of like we have our own NLP we have our own NLP data chunker. We have our own embeddings models. We kind of just try to make it really easy. The second thing which flows from the first thing I really it's the first thing that flows from the second thing is that we're targeting the everyday full stack developer. So we're not targeting ml engineers that are Python experts and want to go into their own their hole they want to go to like build my own chain and do all this stuff. Like there's a lot of people that want to do that they want to build their resume. They want to play with all the tools they want to assemble their own PC and go install their own CPU and let's not ask we're like hey Biomek it's got everything in it. And the user experience is better because it's but it's limited. Like you can't customize every little thing. But it works. And what about
S Speaker 113:46and and then there's there's enough companies that are providing you know, an end to end reg system, which is you should not care what vector database we use what embeddings we use what rack system use which what even underlying model views. How do you differentiate with some of the because the reason I'm asking I think is like, as you know, like the space of rag based enterprise solutions enterprise which is generative. AI based solutions for enterprise, whether it's search or whether it's generate content is is a red ocean. So how does one differentiate from from others in that space?

S Speaker 314:38Well, look, you're exactly right. There's gazillions of us. And, like, no answer here is going to be perfect because we all kind of look like each other. But I'll tell you like, this is what this is sort of our take on it, right? Yeah. We're, we're going after the full stack developer, not these data scientists. Not the MLE, right there's millions of full stack developers that work hard. That's where we come from. This is who we know, this is what we've been building software for. For years. This is who we have empathy for. And so we're going after that developer, they speak JavaScript now Python. It's ridiculous. We're like, wow, it's a it's a JavaScript rag stack. Yes, it's a JavaScript reg. Stack because we're trying to make every react engineer able to implement this. The other thing is, like from that flows, the idea that it's sort of batteries included, like they want to use vs up, right? They don't want to go figure out WebSphere so we're giving them oversell like experience and Netlify. Like experience, and and that's different than contextual by bar, right? Like, and then the third thing is
Well, look, you're exactly right. There's gazillions of us. And, like, no answer here is going to be perfect because we all kind of look like each other. But I'll tell you like, this is what this is sort of our take on it, right? Yeah. We're, we're going after the full stack developer, not these data scientists.

Like, and then the third thing is
S Speaker 316:00just it's like, you can break this down and find out that underneath maybe the stack is exactly the same. But just go on contextual website and try to sign up and use it. You can.
just it's like, you can break this down and find out that underneath maybe the stack is exactly the same. But just go on contextual website and try to sign up and use it. You can.
just it's like, you can break this down and find out that underneath maybe the stack is exactly the same. But just go on contextual website and try to sign up and use it. You can.
just it's like, you can break this down and find out that underneath maybe the stack is exactly the same. But just go on contextual website and try to sign up and use it. You can.
16:14It's just a totally different approach to like.
S Speaker 316:18You can go on our website, sign up and use it and deploy like, you'll be there in five minutes. Okay, my pricing is right on the site, and I have an open source project and you might implement that in 10 minutes. Like that's a totally different approach. Underneath it might be the same work. And then the third thing is, we're focused on one use case right now. And we're gonna stay focused on that use case for a while, which is product information. So, you know, so that that does cover your support. Use case that you guys did for, you know, you were just this project you were describing Qualcomm. Yeah. It covers website search. It covers maybe a little bit of customer support, but only really like what you what you describe, or you've got an internal person trying to figure out product information. But it's, it's really just focused on that. So we're not doing multimodal stuff. We're not doing generative this and that we're not building a framework for building Gen AI, we know its product information. And it's an extension of search. That's why we came we came from search and that's why when you deploy a Rama and you deploy your Rama in the search box, we don't do a chatbot there is no pop up. Like if you want to build your own with our API is fine. You can do that. But we're we're replacing your search box with AI search.
You can go on our website, sign up and use it and deploy like, you'll be there in five minutes.

perplexity for your website, if you want to call for flexion the search
perplexity for your website, if you want to call for flexion the search
perplexity for your website, if you want to call for flexion the search
S Speaker 317:49mean, they're not price perplexity. Search is you know, it's like is like it's copilot search is perplexity, search, like, it's kind of but it's also a chatbot right because you can chat with it.
mean, they're not price perplexity. Search is you know, it's like is like it's copilot search is perplexity, search, like, it's kind of but it's also a chatbot right because you can chat with it.

S Speaker 318:04when you have to do search to do rag. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I don't know what it is, right? Like, the industry doesn't have a name for this. Okay, so yes, it is generated because we're generating an answer.
when you have to do search to do rag. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I don't know what it is, right? Like, the industry doesn't have a name for this. Okay, so yes, it is generated because we're generating an answer.

S Speaker 318:27I'm just I'm laughing about this because all of us don't know what to clean.

I'm just I'm laughing about this because all of us don't know what to clean.
I'm just I'm laughing about this because all of us don't know what to clean.
S Speaker 118:30So essentially I get it. So this is bleak.
S Speaker 318:41yes, kinda. So Linus focused on on intranet search.
yes, kinda. So Linus focused on on intranet search.
yes, kinda. So Linus focused on on intranet search.
yes, kinda. So Linus focused on on intranet search.
S Speaker 318:59there's another thing called Kappa, which is pretty close to us. It seems kPa but it comes in the form of a chat bot. So it doesn't I mean, when you type that question into the chat box, is that search. But one thing that's going to clean this up, I hope for all of us, I hope is search. GPT. Right. It's like it's search GPT search or is it a chatbot? It's got great, it's search GPT. And I haven't like we're just going to tell people look at search GPT for your product. Yeah, which is good.
there's another thing called Kappa, which is pretty close to us. It seems kPa but it comes in the form of a chat bot.

S Speaker 319:48So the interesting thing here is that the only the VCs are the ones who are like, is this search or is it because that's like different buckets for them and they're trying to do market sizing. The customers don't think of it that way. Right? They're not like, Oh, I'm gonna replace elastic with a rhyme system. Like that's not how they they're not thinking that way. Right? So this is really just the VCs that get all hung up on this because they're trying to do market segmentation, how please this market
So the interesting thing here is that the only the VCs are the ones who are like, is this search or is it because that's like different buckets for them and they're trying to do market sizing.

S Speaker 120:12segmenting segmentation here, I mean, the world is changing as we speak. It's not we don't do tam analysis here. I'm not a big fan of that. But, but I'm just trying to figure out what the product is.

S Speaker 120:38the reason why I'm trying to figure that out is because in the red ocean you have to figure out what your budget is. And then it sounds like you have your veggie have decided, I get it, the stacks are all going to go very, very similar, but your wedge into the market has to be it's got to be a product and a go to market wedge.
the reason why I'm trying to figure that out is because in the red ocean you have to figure out what your budget is. And then it sounds like you have your veggie have decided, I get it, the stacks are all going to go very, very similar, but your wedge into the market has to be it's got to be a product and a go to market wedge.

S Speaker 321:01Yeah. Here's the things you have to kind of believe in to like Rama. One is, you have to believe that rag, AI search whatever we call this next thing is going to become the domain of the every engineer it's not going to be like only the employees that get to do this because that's that's a that's an important thesis for us and speak to our entire go to market is based on like, I've done this a long time like, like software is a fashion industry all these stacks look the same right? Like what makes one standout versus the other is it gets traction, it gets momentum, it gets seen everywhere. So we put a lot of energy into being seen being known in particular communities, especially for us in the JavaScript. And so that's kind of our initial wedge and and if you remember back to like Heroku, for example, they did that very successfully in the Ruby community. Right. So it's not that hard to stay there forever. In fact, we have SDK for PHP now. By No, we have to do mobile so your best case for comprehend and swift UI, but we're starting in the JavaScript full stack community because they're underserved. Because when they go to use something like llama index, or contextual, they're like, they're like, I don't understand any of this stuff. All this language is stuff that I don't like what did all these terms what? That doesn't make any sense to me? And the only thing they have today is for sell AI and resell AI is like a, you know, open toolkit to do anything. It's not a focused solution. So you have to believe that the every developer is going to want to and be able to implement whatever we call this like next gen search stuff. So that's one thing you have to like to like go Rama. The other thing you have to be believed is that there's going to be value here, right? So one version of this that you can say, hey, you know, this looks like elastic, or this looks like Algolia and it's kind of just next gen Algolia. And, you know, I'll tell you, it's a good business. It's doing 200 million ARR but like, that's not that big. So whatever. Yeah, this is a piece of infrastructure, that's not going to have a lot of value. We're not we don't believe that because our use case is product information. Right? And so rather than going more and more broad and building more and more toolkits, we're going like I really didn't talk too much more and more integrated value in the marketing stack. Right. So who's responsible for product information in the corporation today, marketing its product in your case, like Qualcomm is product marketing, and b2b Sorry, the b2c case it's the merchandisers right? These are the people that define what the product they define how the products describe what the imagery used is, what the metaphors are. They're responsible for ultimately how it's presented to the buyer. So they can get value from a front a rack stack in a way that's not at all the same as search. Yeah. And the difference is because you're having a conversation, right, so I asked about, like, when I trumped the search box, I get an answer. Then I ask a follow up question that I might come back two days later and ask another question. And I ask a follow up when you've done this yourself probably on perplexity, right. So what happens then is that I learned about you. And I can do that at scale because I'm an AI now, right? So I'm now learning about our customers. They're not really customers, their prospects at this point. I'm learning about our customers and prospects and I can start to qualify them. I can start to understand them I can find trends I can even target offers or try to steer them in certain directions. So now what started as like a rags stack of a piece of technical infrastructure that's like a bunch of stuff glued on top of elastic or something is becoming an AI sales and marketing system. And the ultimate like way that this thing gets measured is not like how many queries that it serves, you know, we charge a penny per query and by pennies per token are stupid, but it gets measured by like, did this thing qualify leads? Did it convert leads? Did it didn't fill shopping carts, right did it like that's, that's when the value really gets unlocked for the first several years of our company? We're gonna like, make some money selling people you know, technical infrastructure, because that's what we have. But, and we're gonna fund our research on that with venture dollars. But as we go, right, the goal here is that we're building like the next front end of your business. Right? And it's whether it's in your mobile app or on your website or your shop with it, or it's happening on the back end of perplexity or to my search GPT like we're providing product information on behalf of your business. And we're converting that into qualified opportunities, and or shopping cart bills and checkouts and that a lot of husbands. That's where we're headed. We're trying to do the third thing you have to believe that around us that we can pull that off.
Yeah. Here's the things you have to kind of believe in to like Rama. One is, you have to believe that rag, AI search whatever we call this next thing is going to become the domain of the every engineer it's not going to be like only the employees that get to do this because that's that's a that's an important thesis for us and speak to our entire go to market is based on like, I've done this a long time like, like software is a fashion industry all these stacks look the same right?

So what happens then is that I learned about you. And I can do that at scale because I'm an AI now, right? So I'm now learning about our customers. They're not really customers, their prospects at this point. I'm learning about our customers and prospects and I can start to qualify them. I can start to understand them I can find trends I can even target offers or try to steer them in certain directions. So now what started as like a rags stack of a piece of technical infrastructure that's like a bunch of stuff glued on top of elastic or something is becoming an AI sales and marketing system. And the ultimate like way that this thing gets measured is not like how many queries that it serves, you know, we charge a penny per query and by pennies per token are stupid, but it gets measured by like, did this thing qualify leads? Did it convert leads? Did it didn't fill shopping carts, right did it like that's, that's when the value really gets unlocked for the first several years of our company? We're gonna like, make some money selling people you know, technical infrastructure, because that's what we have. But, and we're gonna fund our research on that with venture dollars. But as we go, right, the goal here is that we're building like the next front end of your business. Right? And it's whether it's in your mobile app or on your website or your shop with it, or it's happening on the back end of perplexity or to my search GPT like we're providing product information on behalf of your business. And we're converting that into qualified opportunities, and or shopping cart bills and checkouts and that a lot of husbands. That's where we're headed. We're trying to do the third thing you have to believe that around us that we can pull that off.
Yeah. Here's the things you have to kind of believe in to like Rama. One is, you have to believe that rag, AI search whatever we call this next thing is going to become the domain of the every engineer it's not going to be like only the employees that get to do this because that's that's a that's an important thesis for us and speak to our entire go to market is based on like, I've done this a long time like, like software is a fashion industry all these stacks look the same right? Like what makes one standout versus the other is it gets traction, it gets momentum, it gets seen everywhere. So we put a lot of energy into being seen being known in particular communities, especially for us in the JavaScript. And so that's kind of our initial wedge and and if you remember back to like Heroku, for example, they did that very successfully in the Ruby community. Right. So it's not that hard to stay there forever. In fact, we have SDK for PHP now. By No, we have to do mobile so your best case for comprehend and swift UI, but we're starting in the JavaScript full stack community because they're underserved. Because when they go to use something like llama index, or contextual, they're like, they're like, I don't understand any of this stuff. All this language is stuff that I don't like what did all these terms what? That doesn't make any sense to me? And the only thing they have today is for sell AI and resell AI is like a, you know, open toolkit to do anything. It's not a focused solution. So you have to believe that the every developer is going to want to and be able to implement whatever we call this like next gen search stuff. So that's one thing you have to like to like go Rama. The other thing you have to be believed is that there's going to be value here, right? So one version of this that you can say, hey, you know, this looks like elastic, or this looks like Algolia and it's kind of just next gen Algolia. And, you know, I'll tell you, it's a good business. It's doing 200 million ARR but like, that's not that big. So whatever. Yeah, this is a piece of infrastructure, that's not going to have a lot of value. We're not we don't believe that because our use case is product information. Right? And so rather than going more and more broad and building more and more toolkits, we're going like I really didn't talk too much more and more integrated value in the marketing stack. Right. So who's responsible for product information in the corporation today, marketing its product in your case, like Qualcomm is product marketing, and b2b Sorry, the b2c case it's the merchandisers right? These are the people that define what the product they define how the products describe what the imagery used is, what the metaphors are. They're responsible for ultimately how it's presented to the buyer. So they can get value from a front a rack stack in a way that's not at all the same as search. Yeah. And the difference is because you're having a conversation, right, so I asked about, like, when I trumped the search box, I get an answer. Then I ask a follow up question that I might come back two days later and ask another question. And I ask a follow up when you've done this yourself probably on perplexity, right.

S Speaker 326:35Michela came out of near form with with some of the rest of our team. It's a JavaScript consultancy in Europe. Pretty well known. This is my third startup as founder CEO, the last one was acquired by IBM the one before that was overshift. And so we, you know, we could really quickly pull together Friends and family money, and then we just, we just closed most of a $4 million dollar round a month ago, and we can fill the rest of that out. Okay, got it.

S Speaker 127:04So you just closed a seed round that was seed
S Speaker 327:08round priced. And we we have space left in that so the total race to date really sucks.

S Speaker 127:56We're going to do more. See now we typically do more see a but we're going to do more seed and seed stage it's two to $3 million is what we would like but, but also certain maybe I might get kicked out of this conference. So how are you in terms of traction?
We're going to do more. See now we typically do more see a but we're going to do more seed and seed stage it's two to $3 million is what we would like but, but also certain maybe I might get kicked out of this conference. So how are you in terms of traction?

S Speaker 328:25We're a year old we haven't started charging any of our customers. we have, like 1100, sign up users about 15% are active on weekly basis and we're serving 4 million queries a month, this plan.

S Speaker 128:43I think, let me do this, which is well.
S Speaker 329:08other person. Like I very rarely meet someone that's actually implemented one of these things. So, yeah, it'd be a pleasure to treat.

S Speaker 129:21And yeah, exactly. So we do what we're doing a lot in this space,
And yeah, exactly. So we do what we're doing a lot in this space,
And yeah, exactly. So we do what we're doing a lot in this space,
And yeah, exactly. So we do what we're doing a lot in this space,
S Speaker 129:30also working with others. We're building that so would
also working with others. We're building that so would
also working with others. We're building that so would
also working with others. We're building that so would
S Speaker 329:35be like, for example, right now, the thing we're totally had down on is quality scoring and checking, right because that's what we've discovered. That our customers need, because they can't figure out like, should I trust this thing? And you developed potentially a system for measuring that. So that's something we should compare notes on. Yeah.

S Speaker 129:53Why don't I think we can do that as well. Let me think about this and maybe we can even have a conversation that engineers and you
Why don't I think we can do that as well. Let me think about this and maybe we can even have a conversation that engineers and you

30:06and then we can follow up. Yeah, that'd be cool.
S Speaker 330:09There's like a paper for example, that you know, we're all kind of reviewing right now. So everybody's reading the same research.
